11614,"nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 1",,Jared Roach,TF Gene,DNA-Binding: sequence-specific,"NR0B1 and NR0B2 when analyzed by NCBI's ""Conserved Domain"" tool show only the HOLI domain (Ligand binding domain of hormone receptors [smart00430]). HMMER hmmpfam analysis of human NR0B1 with the Pfam database shows PF00104.17 (Ligand-binding domain of nuclear hormone) as the top hit with a E-value of 4.3e-28, and PF02037.14 (SAP domain) as a distant second with and E-value of 0.00041. The SAP (after SAF-A/B, Acinus and PIAS) motif is a putative DNA binding domain found in diverse nuclear proteins. The NCBI GEnRIF for human NR0B1 states ""This gene encodes a protein that contains a DNA-binding domain"", while the entry for human NR0B2 states ""The protein encoded by this gene is an unusual orphan receptor that contains a putative ligand-binding domain but lacks a conventional DNA-binding domain"". Indeed, the canonical length of human NR0B1 is 470 AA, while the canonical length of human NR0B2 is 257 AA, consistent with the presence an extra domain (e.g., DNA binding) in NR0B1. HMMER hmmpfam analysis of human NR0B2 with the Pfam database shows PF00104.17 (Ligand-binding domain of nuclear hormone) as the top hit with a E-value of  6.9e-32, and PF03681.4 (Uncharacterised protein family) as a distant second with and E-value of 0.0022. Together, these considerations suggest that NR0B1 is a DNA-binding TF, and NR0B2 does not bind DNA, and is rather a co-factor.",16709599,TF PPI,Other,Medium

In most cases C/EBP{beta} can form a homodimer and bind to its recognition sequence; however C/EBP{beta} can also intraheterodimerize with other members of the family as well as with a variety of bZIP proteins such as CREB, C/ATF, and AP1.

The Drosophila gene Kr is a member of the gap class of segmentation genes; thoracic and anterior abdominal segments fail to form in Kr mutant embryos. This suggested to Ruppert et al. (1988) that other genes of this class might prove important in normal or disease states. Indeed, other genes important in neoplasia, such as NMYC (164840), LMYC (164850), HER2 (164870), and NRAS (164790), have been identified partly by their homology to previously identified oncogenes.

The hepatocyte nuclear factors are transcriptional activators for liver-specific transcripts such as albumin and transthyretin. The HNF3 family, including HNF3A, HNF3B, and HNF3G are members of the forkhead class of DNA-binding proteins.The transcription factors Hnf3a and Gata4 are the earliest known to bind the albumin gene enhancer in liver precursor cells in mouse embryos. To determine how they access sites in silent chromatin, Cirillo et al. (2002) assembled nucleosome arrays containing albumin enhancer sequences and compacted them with linker histone. Hnf3a and Gata4, but not human NF1, mouse Cebp-beta, or yeast GAL4-AH, bound their sites in compacted chromatin and opened the local nucleosomal domain in the absence of ATP-dependent enzymes. The authors showed that the ability of Hnf3a to open chromatin is mediated by a high-affinity DNA-binding site and by the C-terminal domain of the protein, which binds histones H3 and H4. They concluded that factors that potentiate transcription in development are inherently capable of initiating chromatin opening events.",2227418,DNA Binding,Rat,Strong

Evidence for Hnrpab transcriptional activity comes from studies of the rat Spi2.1 gene promoter, which contains a GAGA box that binds Hnrpab. Mutation of the Spi2.1 GAGA box decreases promoter activity in primary rat hepatocytes.

The TAFs are required for activated rather than basal transcription and serve to mediate signals between various activators and the basal transcriptional machinery. Taf9 is one of these TBP-associated factors.Klemm et al. (1995) cloned a human TFIID subunit, which they termed hTAFII32. The 32-kD protein was isolated from HeLa cell nuclear extracts and partially sequenced. A degenerate oligomer was designed and used to probe a human HeLa cell cDNA library. The identified cDNA has a deduced amino acid sequence of 264 residues and is related to the Drosophila TAFII40. Klemm et al. (1995) showed that TAFII32 interacts with GTF2B and with the viral transcriptional transactivator VP16. The authors showed that recombinantly expressed TAFII32 was functional in a partial recombinant TFIID complex and that the recombinant complex mediated activation by a GAL4-VP16 fusion protein. Lu and Levine (1995) cloned TAF9, which they called TAFII31. TAF9 encodes a 264-amino acid protein. Immunoprecipitation and binding analyses showed interaction of TAF9 with the N-terminal domain of p53 at sites identical to those bound by MDM2, the major cellular negative regulator of p53 activity. Antibodies to TAF9 inhibited p53-activated transcription.
