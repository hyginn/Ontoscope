High-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (HG-NMIBC) is a clinically
unpredictable disease with greater risks of recurrence and progression relative
to their low-intermediate-grade counterparts. The molecular events, including
those affecting the epigenome, that characterize this disease entity in the
context of tumor development, recurrence, and progression, are incompletely
understood. We therefore interrogated genome-wide DNA methylation using
HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays in 21 primary HG-NMIBC tumors relative to
normal bladder controls. Using strict inclusion-exclusion criteria we identified 
1,057 hypermethylated CpGs within gene promoter-associated CpG islands,
representing 256 genes. We validated the array data by bisulphite pyrosequencing 
and examined 25 array-identified candidate genes in an independent cohort of 30
HG-NMIBC and 18 low-intermediate-grade NMIBC. These analyses revealed
significantly higher methylation frequencies in high-grade tumors relative to
low-intermediate-grade tumors for the ATP5G2, IRX1 and VAX2 genes (P<0.05), and
similarly significant increases in mean levels of methylation in high-grade
tumors for the ATP5G2, VAX2, INSRR, PRDM14, VSX1, TFAP2b, PRRX1, and HIST1H4F
genes (P<0.05). Although inappropriate promoter methylation was not invariantly
associated with reduced transcript expression, a significant association was
apparent for the ARHGEF4, PON3, STAT5a, and VAX2 gene transcripts (P<0.05).
Herein, we present the first genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in a unique
HG-NMIBC cohort, showing extensive and discrete methylation changes relative to
normal bladder and low-intermediate-grade tumors. The genes we identified hold
significant potential as targets for novel therapeutic intervention either alone,
or in combination, with more conventional therapeutic options in the treatment of
this clinically unpredictable disease.

We are interested in the roles of epigenetic mechanisms in retinal development.
By ChIP-qPCR using whole retinal extracts at various developmental stages, we
found that the levels of methylation of histones H3K27 and H3K4 and acetylation
of histone H3 at specific loci in various genes, which play critical roles in
retinal proliferation and differentiation, changed dramatically during retinal
development. We next focused on the roles of H3K27 trimethylation in retinal
development. Ezh1 and Ezh2 are methyltransferases that act on H3K27, while Jmjd3 
and Utx are demethylases. We found that Ezh2 and Jmjd3 were mainly expressed
during retinal development, and a loss-of-function of these genes revealed a role
for H3K27me3 in the maturation of subsets of bipolar cells. Furthermore, Ezh2 and
Jmjd3 regulate H3K27 trimethylation at specific loci within Bhlhb4 and Vsx1,
which play critical roles in the differentiation of subsets of bipolar cells. Utx
is expressed weakly in retina, and the down-regulation of Utx by sh-RNA in
retinal explants suggested that Utx also participates in the maturation of
bipolar cells. Ezh1 is expressed weakly in postnatal retina, and the phenotype of
Ezh2-knockout retina suggested that Ezh1 plays a role in the methylation of H3K27
in the late phase of retinal differentiation. Taken together, we found that these
four genes, which exhibit temporally and spatially unique expression patterns
during retinal development, play critical roles in the differentiation of retinal
subsets through the regulation of histone H3K27 methylation at critical genetic
loci.

BACKGROUND: Visual system homeobox gene (VSX1) plays a major role in the early
development of craniofacial and ocular tissues including cone opsin gene in the
human retina. To date, few disease-causing mutations of VSX1 have been linked to 
familial and sporadic keratoconus (KC) in humans. In this study, we describe the 
clinical features and screening for VSX1 gene in families with KC from India.
METHODS: Clinical data and genomic DNA were collected from patients with
clinically diagnosed KC and their family members. The study was conducted on 20
subjects of eight families from India. The coding exons of VSX1 gene were
amplified using PCR and amplicons were analyzed by direct sequencing. Predictive 
effect of the mutations was performed using Polyphen-2, SIFT and mutation
assessor algorithms. Additionally, haplotypes of VSX1 gene were constructed for
affected and unaffected individuals using SNPs.
RESULTS: In the coding region of VSX1, one novel missense heterozygous change
(p.Leu268His) was identified in five KC patients from two unrelated families.
Another family of three members had a novel heterozygous change (p.Ser251Thr).
These variants co-segregated with the disease phenotype in all affected
individuals but not in the unaffected family members and 105 normal controls. In 
silico analysis suggested that p.Leu268His could have a deleterious effect on the
protein coded by VSX1, while p.Ser251Thr has a neutral effect on the functional
properties of VSX1. Haplotype examination revealed common SNPs around the
missense change (p.Leu268His) in two unrelated KC families.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we add p.Leu268His, a novel missense variation in the
coding region of VSX1 to the existing repertoire of VSX1 coding variations
observed in Indian patients with the characteristic phenotype of KC. The variant 
p.Ser251Thr might be a benign polymorphism, but further biophysical studies are
necessary to evaluate its molecular mechanism. The shared haplotype by two
families with the same variant suggests the possibility of a founder effect,
which requires further elucidation. We suggest that p.Leu268His might be involved
in the pathogenesis of KC, which may help in the genetic counselling of patients 
and their family.

BACKGROUND: Genetic heritability and expression study have shown that different
diabetes traits have common genetic components and pathways. A computationally
efficient pathway analysis of GWAS results will benefit post-GWAS study of SNP
associations and identification of common genetic pathways from diabetes GWAS can
help to improve understanding of the disease pathogenesis.
RESULTS: We proposed a uniform-score gene-set analysis (USGSA) with implemented
package to unify different gene measures by a uniform score for identifying
pathways from GWAS data, and use a pre-generated permutation distribution table
to quickly obtain multiple-testing adjusted p-value. Simulation studies of
uniform score for four gene measures (minP, 2ndP, simP and fishP) have shown that
USGSA has strictly controlled family-wise error rate. The power depends on types 
of gene measure. USGSA with a two-stage study strategy was applied to identify
common pathways associated with diabetes traits based on public dbGaP GWAS
results. The study identified 7 gene sets that contain binding motifs at promoter
region of component genes for 5 transcription factors (TFs) of FOXO4, TCF3, NFAT,
VSX1 and POU2F1, and 1 microRNA of mir-218. These gene sets include 25 common
genes that are among top 5% of the gene associations over genome for all GWAS.
Previous evidences showed that nearly all of these genes are mainly expressed in 
the brain.
CONCLUSIONS: USGSA is a computationally efficient approach for pathway analysis
of GWAS data with promoted interpretability and comparability. The pathway
analysis suggested that different diabetes traits share common pathways and
component genes are potentially regulated by common TFs and microRNA. The result 
also indicated that the central nervous system has a critical role in diabetes
pathogenesis. The findings will be important in formulating novel hypotheses for 
guiding follow-up studies.

MicroRNA-20a is essential for normal embryogenesis by targeting vsx1 mRNA in
fish.

MicroRNAs are major post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and have
essential roles in diverse developmental processes. In vertebrates, some
regulatory genes play different roles at different developmental stages. These
genes are initially transcribed in a wide embryonic region but restricted within 
distinct cell types at subsequent stages during development. Therefore,
post-transcriptional regulation is required for the transition from one
developmental stage to the next and the establishment of different cell
identities. However, the regulation of many multiple functional genes at
post-transcription level during development remains unknown. Here we show that
miR-20a can target the mRNA of vsx1, a multiple functional gene, at the 3'-UTR
and inhibit protein expression in both goldfish and zebrafish. The expression of 
miR-20a is initiated ubiquitously at late gastrula stage and exhibits a
tissue-specific pattern in the developing retina. Inhibition of vsx1 3'-UTR
mediated protein expression occurs when and where miR-20a is expressed. Decoying 
miR-20a resulted in severely impaired head, eye and trunk formation in
association with excessive generation of vsx1 marked neurons in the spinal cord
and defects of somites in the mesoderm region. These results demonstrate that
miR-20a is essential for normal embryogenesis by restricting Vsx1 expression in
goldfish and zebrafish, and that post-transcriptional regulation is an essential 
mechanism for Vsx1 playing different roles in diverse developmental processes.

BACKGROUND: Keratoconus (KC) is a complex degenerative disorder of the cornea.
Genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors may all contribute to the
pathogenesis of KC. Most of the reported KC-associated SNPs have been detected in
Caucasians and Australians. To investigate whether the reported associated SNPs
can be found in a Chinese population, we performed a replication study of the
significantly associated SNPs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 210 unrelated Chinese KC patients and 191
unrelated controls were included in the present study. SNPs rs4954218 (Near
RAB3GAP1 (5')), rs4894535 (FNDC3B), rs2956540 (LOX), rs3735520 (Near HGF (5')),
rs1324183 (MPDZ-NF1B), rs1536482 (RXRA-COL5A1), rs7044529 (COL5A1), rs2721051
(Near FOXO1 (3')), rs9938149 (BANP-ZNF469) and rs6050307 (VSX1) were assessed for
their association with KC. The genotype of each SNP was detected using the
Sequenom MassARRAY-Assay.
RESULTS: SNP rs1324183 located in MPDZ-NF1B was associated with an increased risk
of KC (OR=3.108, 95% CI=1.366-7.072, p=0.005), and SNP rs2956540 in the LOX gene 
may confer a reduced risk of KC with a borderline p value in our population
(OR=0.664, 95% CI=0.447-0.986, p=0.042). No significant difference was observed
between patients and controls in the other eight SNP genotypes and allele
frequencies.
CONCLUSIONS: The replication association of rs1324183 (MPDZ-NF1B) with KC in our 
population and the results, which are identical to those in different
populations, suggest that rs1324183 (MPDZ-NF1B) is a common genetic risk for KC
and should be further investigated.

The histone modification H3K27me3 regulates transcription negatively, and Jmjd3
and Ezh2 demethylate and methylate H3K27me3 and H3K27, respectively. We
demonstrated previously that Jmjd3 plays pivotal roles in the differentiation of 
subsets of bipolar (BP) cells by regulating H3K27me3 levels at the Bhlhb4 and
Vsx1 loci, both of which are transcription factors essential for the maturation
of BP cell subsets. In this study, we examined the role of Ezh2 in retinal
development using retina-specific Ezh2 conditional knockout mice (Ezh2-CKO). The 
eyes of the Ezh2-CKO mice were microphthalemic, and the proliferation of retinal 
cells was diminished postnatally in Ezh2-CKO. Differentiation of all examined
retinal subsets was observed with higher proportion of BP cell subsets, which was
determined by immunostaining using specific retinal markers. The onsets of Müller
glia and rod photoreceptor differentiation were accelerated. The expression of
Bhlhb4 was increased in postnatal retinas, which was accompanied by the loss of
H3K27me3 modifications at these genetic loci. Decreased expression of proneural
genes in postnatal stage was observed. As reported previously in other Ezh2-KO
tissues, increased expression of Arf/Ink4a was observed in the Ezh2-CKO retinas. 
The ectopic expression of Arf or Ink4a in the retina suppressed proliferation and
increased apoptosis. In addition, earlier onset of Müller glia differentiation
was observed in Ink4a-expressing cells. These results support an important role
for histone H3K27me3 modification in regulating the proliferation and maturation 
of certain subsets of interneurons in the retina.

PURPOSE: Proper visual transmission depends on the retinal ON and OFF pathways.
We used Vsx1-/- mice with a retinal OFF visual pathway defect to determine the
role of OFF pathway signaling in refractive development (RD) of the eye.
METHODS: Refractive development was measured every 2 weeks in Vsx1-/-, Vsx1+/+
(both on 129S1/Sv background), and commonly used C57BL/6J mice from 4 to 12 weeks
of age. Form deprivation (FD) was induced monocularly from 4 weeks of age using
head-mounted diffuser goggles. Refractive state, corneal curvature, and ocular
biometry were obtained weekly using photorefraction, keratometry, and 1310 nm
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Retinal dopamine and its
metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate (DOPAC), were measured using
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
RESULTS: During normal development, the Vsx1-/- and Vsx1+/+ mice showed similar
myopic refractions at younger ages (4 weeks, Vsx1-/-: -5.28±0.75 diopter (D); WT:
-4.73±0.98 D) and became significantly hyperopic by 12 weeks of age (Vsx1-/-:
3.28±0.82 D; WT: 5.33±0.81 D). However, the C57BL/6J mice were relatively
hyperopic at younger ages (mean refraction at 4 weeks, 3.40±0.43 D), and
developed more hyperopic refractions until about 7 weeks of age (8.07±0.55 D)
before stabilizing. Eight weeks of FD did not induce a myopic shift in the
129S1/Sv animals (0.16±0.85 D), as opposed to a significant shift of -4.29±0.42 D
in the C57BL/6J mice. At 4 weeks of visual development, dopamine turnover (the
DOPAC/dopamine ratio) was significantly greater in the 129S1/Sv mice compared to 
the C57BL/6J mice. FD did not alter the levels of dopamine between the goggled
and opposite eyes for any genotype or strain.
CONCLUSIONS: OFF pathway signaling may not be critically important for normal
refractive development in mice. Elevated retinal dopamine turnover in early
refractive development may prevent FD myopia in 129S1/Sv mice compared to
C57BL/6J mice.

Prechordal mesendoderm (PME) is a derivative of gastrula organizer underlying the
anterior neural plate of vertebrate embryos. It has been firmly established that 
PME is critical for head induction and anterior-posterior patterning. Therefore, 
the establishment of PME in a desired shape and size at a correct position during
early embryogenesis is crucial for normal head patterning. However, it remains
largely unclear how the desired form and size of PME is generated at a
predestined position during early embryogenesis. Here we show that in zebrafish a
maternal transcription repressor Vsx1 is essential for this early developmental
regulation. Knocking down maternal vsx1 resulted in impaired PME formation and
progression associated with a deficient and posteriorized forebrain. Loss- and
gain-of-function experiments showed that maternal Vsx1 is essential for
repressing ntl ectopic expression in more animal region at early gastrula stages.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay in combination with core consensus sequence
mutation analysis further revealed that maternal Vsx1 can directly repress ntl
transcription by binding to the proximal promoter at a specific site.
Simultaneous inhibition of ntl function could successfully suppress the defects
of both PME and forebrain formation in maternal Vsx1 knockdown embryos. Our
results reveal a pivotal role for maternal Vsx1 as a direct transcriptional
repressor of ntl expression at the margin of the zebrafish gastrula to ensure
directional cell polarization and migration of PME cells.

Optix defines a neuroepithelial compartment in the optic lobe of the Drosophila
brain.

BACKGROUND: During early brain development, the organisation of neural
progenitors into a neuroepithelial sheet maintains tissue integrity during
growth. Neuroepithelial cohesion and patterning is essential for orderly
proliferation and neural fate specification. Neuroepithelia are regionalised by
the expression of transcription factors and signalling molecules, resulting in
the formation of distinct developmental, and ultimately functional, domains.
RESULTS: We have discovered that the Six3/6 family orthologue Optix is an
essential regulator of neuroepithelial maintenance and patterning in the
Drosophila brain. Six3 and Six6 are required for mammalian eye and forebrain
development, and mutations in humans are associated with severe eye and brain
malformation. In Drosophila, Optix is expressed in a sharply defined region of
the larval optic lobe, and its expression is reciprocal to that of the
transcription factor Vsx1. Optix gain- and loss-of-function affects
neuroepithelial adhesion, integrity and polarity. We find restricted cell lineage
boundaries that correspond to transcription factor expression domains.
CONCLUSION: We propose that the optic lobe is compartmentalised by expression of 
Optix and Vsx1. Our findings provide insight into the spatial patterning of a
complex region of the brain, and suggest an evolutionarily conserved principle of
visual system development.

PURPOSE: Keratoconus (KTCN) is a degenerative disorder of the eye that results in
the conical shape and thinning of the cornea and is a leading cause for corneal
transplantations. A number of studies suggest that genetic factors play a role in
KTCN etiology. Some candidate gene variants have recently been shown to be
associated with KTCN. The purpose of our study was to verify the role of VSX1,
TGFBI, DOCK9, IPO5, and STK24 sequence variants in Polish KTCN patients.
METHODS: Forty-two Polish patients with sporadic KTCN and 50 control individuals 
were enrolled into this study. Both affected and unaffected individuals underwent
detailed ophthalmic examination. The mutations screening in the candidate genes
was performed by the direct sequencing method.
RESULTS: Analysis of VSX1, TGFBI, DOCK9, IPO5, and STK24 genes identified
numerous sequence variants. Variants c.-264_-255delGGGGTGGGGT, c.627<U+2009>+<U+2009>23G<U+2009>><U+2009>A,
c.809-6_809-5insT, and c.*200G<U+2009>><U+2009>T in the VSX1 gene, and heterozygous c.1598G<U+2009>><U+2009>A
mutation (Arg533Gln) in exon 12 of TGFBI were detected for the first time in KTCN
patients. Two known sequence variants of TGFBI c.1620T<U+2009>><U+2009>C (Phe540Phe) and
c.1678<U+2009>+<U+2009>23G<U+2009>><U+2009>A were observed in KTCN patients and control individuals. The
newly reported c.717<U+2009>+<U+2009>43A<U+2009>><U+2009>G substitution in intron 7 of DOCK9 was identified
in both KTCN patients and healthy individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation showed that KTCN-related sequence variants of
analyzed genes were found in a very small proportion of the studied patients
indicating that genes other than VSX1, TGFBI, DOCK9, IPO5, and STK24 are involved
in the development and progression of KTCN in Polish patients. Our results
support the hypothesis about the genetic heterogeneity of KTCN.

AIM: To investigate the effects of bovine pituitary extract on the proliferation 
of keratocytes and maintaining the keratocyte phenotype in vitro.
METHODS: Single keratocytes were isolated by enzyme digestion for in vitro
culture. Three groups were designed according to the different culture media: a
bovine pituitary extract (BPE) group, a fetal bovine serum (FBS) group and the
control group. The phenotypes and proliferation of cultured cells were evaluated 
by morphology, immunofluorescent staining and mRNA expression of CD34, Lumican,
VSX1, a-SMA and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). In the BPE group,
cells underwent serial subcultivation, and their phenotypes were identified by
immunofluorescent staining. To analyze the proliferation of keratocytes in
different concentrations of BPE, six different concentrations were designed to
ascertain the most appropriate amount.
RESULTS: In the BPE group, the cells spread out and presented dendritic
morphology, and their dendrites connected to one another to form networks. On the
third passage, most cells maintained their phenotype. In the FBS group, the cells
exhibited a dendritic appearance in early cultured stages, but their morphology
subsequently changed into a fibroblast-like shape. The number of dendritic cells 
in BPE group was more than FBS and control groups. Immunofluorescent staining and
real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed that few keratocytes
underwent fibroblastic transformation in the BPE and control groups, and that
proliferation was higher in the BPE group than in the control group. Although the
proliferation was higher in the FBS group, many keratocytes underwent
fibroblastic transformation. The analysis of cell morphology and mRNA expressions
of CD34, PCNA and VSX1 in six group showed that different concentrations of BPE
affected the proliferation obviously but didn't affect the keratocyte phenotype, 
and the concentration of 40µg/mL was the most appropriate one.
CONCLUSION: BPE can improve the proliferation of keratocytes and maintain their
phenotype in vitro. Many keratocytes can be harvested rapidly and provide seeds
for the construction of corneal stroma.

Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) play important roles in retinogenesis. They are
required for normal retinal histogenesis and retinal cell number balance.
Developmental RGC loss is typically characterized by initial retinal neuronal
number imbalance and subsequent loss of retinal neurons. However, it is not clear
whether loss of a specific non-RGC cell type in the RGC-depleted retina is due to
reduced cell production or subsequent degeneration. Taking advantage of three
knockout mice with varying degrees of RGC depletion, we re-examined bipolar cell 
production in these retinas from various aspects. Results show that generation of
the cone bipolar cells is correlated with the existing number of RGCs. However,
generation of the rod bipolar cells is unaffected by RGC shortage. Results report
the first observation that RGCs selectively influence the genesis of subsequent
retinal cell types.

Axial-paraxial mesoderm patterning is a special dorsal-ventral patterning event
of establishing the vertebrate body plan. Though dorsal-ventral patterning has
been extensively studied, the initiation of axial-paraxial mesoderm pattering
remains largely unrevealed. In zebrafish, spt cell-autonomously regulates
paraxial mesoderm specification and flh represses spt expression to promote axial
mesoderm fate, but the expression domains of spt and flh initially overlap in the
entire marginal zone of the embryo. Defining spt and flh territories is therefore
a premise of axial-paraxial mesoderm patterning. In this study, we investigated
why and how the initial expression of flh becomes repressed in the ventrolateral 
marginal cells during blastula stage. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments
showed that a maternal transcription factor Vsx1 is essential for restricting flh
expression within the dorsal margin and preserving spt expression and paraxial
mesoderm specification in the ventrolateral margin of embryo. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays in combination with
core consensus sequence mutation analysis further revealed that Vsx1 can directly
repress flh by binding to the proximal promoter at a specific site. Inhibiting
maternal vsx1 translation resulted in confusion of axial and paraxial mesoderm
markers expression and axial-paraxial mesoderm patterning. These results
demonstrated that direct transcriptional repression of the decisive axial
mesoderm gene by maternal ventralizing factor is a crucial regulatory mechanism
of initiating axial-paraxial mesoderm patterning in vertebrates.

OBJECTIVE: Keratoconus (KC) is an eye disorder in which the cornea is swollen,
thinned and deformed. Despite extensive studies, the pathophysiological processes
and genetic etiology of KC are unknown. The disease incidence is approximately 1 
in 2,000, and it is the most common cause of corneal transplantation in the USA. 
Many genes are involved in the disease, but evidence suggests a major role for
VSX1 in the etiology of KC. This study aimed to determine the frequency of
mutations in exons 2, 3 and 4 of the VSX1 gene in Chaharmahal va Bakhtiari
province in the southwest of Iran.
STUDY DESIGN: In this experimental study, mutations in 3 exons, namely exons 2, 3
and 4, of VSX1 were investigated in 50 patients with KC and 50 healthy control
subjects. DNA was extracted using a standard phenol-chloroform method.
PCR-single-strand conformational polymorphism/heteroduplex analysis was
performed, followed by DNA sequencing to confirm the identified motility shifts.
RESULTS: H244R mutations were found in 1 patient and also in 1 healthy control
subject. Furthermore, 12 polymorphisms were identified in patients with KC and 7 
in healthy control subjects [rs6138482 and c.546A>G (rs12480307)].
CONCLUSION: Our investigation showed that KC-related VSX1 mutations were found in
a very small proportion of the studied patients from Iran. Further investigations
on other genes are needed to clarify their roles in KC pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: A number of mutations in the VSX1 and SOD1 genes have been reported
to be associated with keratoconus (KC), however the results from different
studies are controversial. In this study, we conducted the genotyping of common
polymorphisms [VSX1: D144E, H244R, R166W, G160D; SOD1: intronic 7-base deletion
(c.169 + 50 delTAAACAG)], in a case-control sample panel of the Greek population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control panel, with 33 KC patients and 78 healthy
controls, were surveyed. DNA from each individual was tested for the VSX1: D144E,
H244R, R166W, G160D and SOD1: intronic 7-base deletion (c.169 + 50 delTAAACAG)
polymorphisms by direct sequencing.
RESULTS: We observed no polymorphisms of the VSX1 gene in the case-control panel.
Concerning the SOD1 intronic 7-base deletion (c.169 + 50 delTAAACAG), our
findings suggest that heterozygous carriers are over-represented among KC cases
compared to healthy controls (p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: We cannot confirm the previously reported association of the
polymorphism in the VSX1 gene with KC. Our results suggest a possible causative
role of SOD1 in the pathogenesis of KC. Further studies are required to identify 
other important genetic factors involved in the pathogenesis and progression of
KC.

Keratoconus is the most common ectatic disorder of the corneal. Genetic and
environmental factors may contribute to its pathogenesis. The focus of this
article is to summarize current research into the complex genetics of
keratoconus. We discuss the evidence of genetic etiology including family-based
linkage studies, twin studies, genetic mutations, and genome-wide association
studies. The genes implicated potentially include VSX1, miR-184, DOCK9, SOD1,
RAB3GAP1, and HGF. Besides the coding mutations, we also highlight the potential 
contribution of DNA copy number variants in the pathogenesis of keratoconus.
Finally, we present future directions for genetic research in the understanding
of the complex genetics of keratoconus and its clinical significance. As new
functional, candidate genes for keratoconus are being discovered at a rapid pace,
the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying keratoconus pathogenesis will advance
our understanding of keratoconus and promote the development of a novel therapy.

Angeles, CA 90095–7003, USA. aldave@jsei.ucla.edu

The aim of this review was to provide an evidenced-based review of the genetic
basis of the corneal endothelial dystrophies. A review of the English language
peer-reviewed literature describing the molecular genetic basis of posterior
polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD), congenital hereditary endothelial
dystrophy (CHED), Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) and X-linked
endothelial corneal dystrophy (XECD) was performed. Mutations in several genes
have been implicated as playing a pathogenic role in the corneal endothelial
dystrophies: VSX1 mutations in PPCD1; COL8A2 mutations in PPCD2 and FECD; ZEB1
mutations in PPCD3 and FECD; and SLC4A11 mutations in CHED2 and FECD. However,
linkage, association and familial segregation analyses support a role of only one
gene in each corneal endothelial dystrophy: ZEB1 in PPCD3, SLC4A11 in CHED2 and
COL8A2 in FECD (early onset). In addition, insufficient evidence exists to
consider the autosomal dominant form of CHED (CHED1) as distinct from PPCD. An
accurate classification of the corneal endothelial dystrophies requires a
critical review of the evidence to support the role of each suggested chromosomal
locus, gene and genetic mutation associated with a corneal endothelial dystrophy.
Only after the separation of evidence from opinion is performed can a critical
examination of the molecular pathways that lead to endothelial dysfunction in
each of these disorders be accurately performed.

PURPOSE: Mutations in the visual system homeobox 1 (VSX1) gene have been
described at a low frequency in keratoconus and posterior polymorphous corneal
dystrophy (PPCD). The putative role is controversial for several reasons,
including a lack of mutations detected in other population cohorts. This study
aims to determine whether VSX1 contributes to the genetic pathogenesis of
keratoconus and PPCD in a New Zealand population, and includes analysis of a
Polynesian population.
METHODS: Recruitment of patients with keratoconus and PPCD, comprehensive
clinical examination including corneal topography and pachymetry, and collection 
of biologic samples for DNA extraction were undertaken. Mutational analysis of
VSX1 (exons 1-7) with PCR and sequencing with bioinformatic assessment of
variants was performed. Probable pathogenic variants were screened for in a
control population using high-resolution melting analysis.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients with keratoconus, including 15 familial cases, and 
ten unrelated patients with PPCD were recruited. Two pathogenic changes were
detected; a novel change c.173C>T (p.Pro58Leu) was found in a patient with PPCD, 
predicted to be pathogenic, and not seen in 200 ethnically matched control
alleles. The previously reported c.731A>G (p.His244Arg) was detected in a patient
with sporadic keratoconus, and not present in the controls. No family members
were available for segregation analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the presence of pathogenic mutations in VSX1 in
PPCD and keratoconus, including a novel disease-causing variant. The affected
numbers are small, but given the growing body of evidence of pathogenic
segregating changes in VSX1 in disease cohorts, the expression in keratocytes as 
part of wound healing, and the documented association of PPCD and keratoconus, it
seems likely that the role of VSX1 as a genetic factor contributing to disease is
real.

BACKGROUND: The involvement of VSX1 gene for the genetic basis of keratoconus is 
unclear and controversial. The genetic screening of VSX1 from different ethnic
populations can enlighten this subject. The aim of the present study is to
investigate the role of VSX1 gene in patients with sporadic cases of keratoconus 
from South India.
METHODS: The VSX1 gene coding regions, including exon-intron boundaries were
screened by direct sequencing analysis in 117 sporadic cases of keratoconus. The 
identified variations were also analyzed in 108 ethnic matched healthy blood
donors.
RESULTS: In the VSX1 gene screening, no pathogenic mutation was identified,
whereas we could find the presence of four reported single nucleotide
polymorphisms; c.546A>G (rs12480307), c.627+23G>A (rs6138482), c.627+84T>A
(rs56157240) and c.504-24C>T (IVS3-24C). These variations were observed in
similar frequency between cases and controls.
CONCLUSIONS: The lack of VSX1 pathogenic variations in a large number of
unrelated sporadic keratoconus patients tend to omit its role, and corroborate
the involvement of other genetic, environmental or behavioural factors in the
development of this complex disorder.

Insights into keratoconus from a genetic perspective.

Burdon KP(1), Vincent AL.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Ophthalmology, Flinders University, Adelaide, South Australia,
Australia.

Keratoconus is a progressive and non-inflammatory thinning of the cornea, which
may result in severe visual impairment due to irregular curvature and scarring.
It can occur in isolation but is often seen in association with other systemic or
ocular disorders. There is a well-recognised genetic component to keratoconus, as
evidenced by family and twin studies; however, the aetiology of the disease is
complex with both genetic and environmental factors playing a role. Over the last
decade significant progress has been made in identifying genetic risk factors for
keratoconus. Multiple approaches have been taken including candidate gene studies
and genome-wide studies. VSX1 remains as the best characterised keratoconus gene 
but only accounts for rare cases. Other candidate genes with a role to play
include SOD1, other corneal dystrophy genes such as ZEB1 and TGFBI and collagen
genes. Family-based studies have recently led to the identification of the MIR184
gene for keratoconus with cataract and to the DOCK9 gene in a family with
isolated keratoconus. Numerous other linkages have been reported and new
sequencing technologies are set to rapidly expand the number of identified
keratoconus genes in these regions. Similarly, recent genome-wide association
studies in case-controlled cohorts have identified common variations in and
around HGF, RAB3GAP1 and LOX as candidate risk factors for keratoconus. These
gene identifications are beginning to reveal the molecular aetiology of
keratoconus but despite this recent progress, there remain numerous genetic risk 
factors to be identified for this relatively common yet complex disease.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs)
in VSX1, COL4A3, COL4A4, IL1A and IL1B genes were associated with keratoconus
(KTCN) in the Han Chinese population.
METHODS: Ninety-seven KTCN patients and 101 healthy controls were enrolled in
this study. All cases were diagnosed on the basis of clinical examination.
Twenty-one tSNPs were selected for association study in five genes. SNP
genotyping was performed by Sequenom MassARRAY RS1000. Sequenom Typer 4.0
Software, PLINK, Haploview and SHEsis software platform were used to perform data
management and analyses.
RESULTS: Three tSNPs in the VSX1 gene were observed to be associated with KTCN
risk at a 5% level by <U+03C7>(2) test (rs56157240 and rs12480307, p = 0.0499, OR: 6.42,
95% CI: 0.77-53.78; rs6050307, p = 1.22 × 10(-7), OR: 0.05, 95% CI: 0.01-0.23).
Rs2071376 in the IL1A gene was also associated with KTCN (p = 0.0487, OR: 1.51,
95% CI: 1.00-2.26). Three haplotypes in the VSX1 gene were found to be associated
with risk of KTCN (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirmed previous reports that polymorphisms of VSX1
and IL1A genes were associated with risk of KTCN in the Chinese population,
suggesting an important determinant of KTCN development by VSX1 and IL1A genes.

Regulation of retinal interneuron subtype identity by the Iroquois homeobox gene 
Irx6.

Interneuronal subtype diversity lies at the heart of the distinct molecular
properties and synaptic connections that shape the formation of the neuronal
circuits that are necessary for the complex spatial and temporal processing of
sensory information. Here, we investigate the role of Irx6, a member of the
Iroquois homeodomain transcription factor family, in regulating the development
of retinal bipolar interneurons. Using a knock-in reporter approach, we show
that, in the mouse retina, Irx6 is expressed in type 2 and 3a OFF bipolar
interneurons and is required for the expression of cell type-specific markers in 
these cells, likely through direct transcriptional regulation. In Irx6 mutant
mice, presumptive type 3a bipolar cells exhibit an expansion of their axonal
projection domain to the entire OFF region of the inner plexiform layer, and
adopt molecular features of both type 2 and 3a bipolar cells, highlighted by the 
ectopic upregulation of neurokinin 3 receptor (Nk3r) and Vsx1. These findings
reveal Irx6 as a key regulator of type 3a bipolar cell identity that prevents
these cells from adopting characteristic features of type 2 bipolar cells.
Analysis of the Irx6;Vsx1 double null retina suggests that the terminal
differentiation of type 2 bipolar cells is dependent on the combined expression
of the transcription factors Irx6 and Vsx1, but also points to the existence of
Irx6;Vsx1-independent mechanisms in regulating OFF bipolar subtype-specific gene 
expression. This work provides insight into the generation of neuronal subtypes
by revealing a mechanism in which opposing, yet interdependent, transcription
factors regulate subtype identity.

Sequence divergence in the 3'-untranslated region has an effect on the
subfunctionalization of duplicate genes.

Tong Y(1), Zheng K, Zhao S, Xiao G, Luo C.

Author information: 
(1)College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, People's
Republic of China.

Recent studies demonstrated that sequence divergence in both transcriptional
regulatory region and coding region contributes to the subfunctionalization of
duplicate gene. However, whether sequence divergence in the 3'-untranslated
region (3'-UTR) has an impact on the subfunctionalization of duplicate genes
remains unclear. Here, we identified two diverging duplicate vsx1 (visual system 
homeobox-1) loci in goldfish, named vsx1A1 and vsx1A2. Phylogenetic analysis
suggests that vsx1A1 and vsx1A2 may arise from a duplication of vsx1 after the
separation of goldfish and zebrafish. Sequence comparison revealed that
divergence in both transcriptional and translational regulatory regions is higher
than divergence in the introns. vsx1A2 expresses during blastula and gastrula
stages and in adult retina but silences from segmentation stage to hatching
stage, vsx1A1 starts expression from segmentation onward. Comparing to that
zebrafish vsx1 expresses in all the developmental stages and in the adult retina,
it appears that goldfish vsx1A1 and vsx1A2 are under going to share the functions
of ancestral vsx1. The different but overlapping temporal expression patterns of 
vsx1A1 and vsx1A2 suggest that sequence divergence in the promoter region of
duplicate vsx1 is not sufficient for partitioning the functions of ancestral
vsx1. By comparing vsx1A1 and vsx1A2 3'-UTR-linked green fluorescent protein gene
expression patterns, we demonstrated that the 3'-UTR of vsx1A1 remains but the
3'-UTR of vsx1A2 has lost the capability of mediating bipolar cell specific
expression during retina development. These results indicate that sequence
divergence in the 3'-UTRs has a clear effect on subfunctionalization of the
duplicate genes.

VSX1 gene and keratoconus: genetic analysis in Korean patients.

Jeoung JW(1), Kim MK, Park SS, Kim SY, Ko HS, Wee WR, Lee JH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.

PURPOSE: The visual system homeobox 1 (VSX1) gene variants have recently been
shown to be associated with keratoconus. To replicate this finding, we performed 
a genetic analysis of the VSX1 gene in a Korean case-control sample.
METHODS: Patients with keratoconus and healthy control subjects were recruited
from Seoul National University Hospital. A diagnosis of keratoconus was made
based on clinical examinations and the presence of characteristic topographic
features. For all patients and controls, the whole coding region and the
exon-intron junctions of the VSX1 gene were analyzed by direct sequencing.
RESULTS: Fifty-three patients with keratoconus and 100 healthy volunteers were
included. We observed 2 novel missense substitutions (Leu17Val and Val199Leu) and
1 previously reported substitution (Gly160Val) in 6 of the 53 affected probands. 
Because these substitutions have been identified in unaffected individuals, they 
were not considered to be pathogenic. No intragenic polymorphism was associated
with a significantly increased risk of keratoconus.
CONCLUSIONS: We cannot confirm the previously reported association of the VSX1
gene variants with keratoconus. Our results suggest that the VSX1 gene and its
mutations with amino acid changes do not play a major role in the pathogenesis of
keratoconus.

BACKGROUND: Retinal progenitor cells are a convenient source of cell replacement 
therapy in retinal degenerative disorders. The purpose of this study was to
evaluate the expression patterns of the homeobox genes PAX6 and CHX10 (retinal
progenitor markers) during treatment of human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)
cells with amniotic fluid (AF), RPE cells harvested from neonatal cadaver globes 
were cultured in a mixture of DMEM and Ham's F12 supplemented with 10% FBS. At
different passages, cells were trypsinized and co-cultured with 30% AF obtained
from normal fetuses of 1416 weeks gestational age.
RESULTS: Compared to FBS-treated controls, AF-treated cultures exhibited special 
morphological changes in culture, including appearance of spheroid colonies,
improved initial cell adhesion and ordered cell alignment. Cell proliferation
assays indicated a remarkable increase in the proliferation rate of RPE cells
cultivated in 30% AF-supplemented medium, compared with those grown in the
absence of AF. Immunocytochemical analyses exhibited nuclear localization of
retinal progenitor markers at a ratio of 33% and 27% for CHX10 and PAX6,
respectively. This indicated a 3-fold increase in retinal progenitor markers in
AF-treated cultures compared to FBS-treated controls. Real-time PCR data of
retinal progenitor genes (PAX6, CHX10 and VSX-1) confirmed these results and
demonstrated AF's capacity for promoting retinal progenitor cell generation.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, the results suggest that AF significantly promotes
the rate of retinal progenitor cell generation, indicating that AF can be used as
an enriched supplement for serum-free media used for the in vitro propagation of 
human progenitor cells.

Lesion-induced generation of interneuron cell types in specific dorsoventral
domains in the spinal cord of adult zebrafish.

Edinburgh, UK.

In contrast to mammals, adult zebrafish regenerate neurons in the lesioned spinal
cord. For example, motor neurons are generated from an olig2-expressing
population of pMN-like ependymoradial glial cells in a ventrolateral position at 
the central canal. However, the extent of neuronal regeneration is unclear. Here 
we show, using a transgenic fish in which V2 interneurons are labeled by green
fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the vsx1 promoter, that after a
complete spinal cord transection, large numbers of V2 interneurons are generated 
in the vicinity of the lesion site. Tg(vsx1:GFP)<U+207A> cells are not present in the
unlesioned spinal cord and label with the proliferation marker bromodeoxyuridine 
(BrdU) after a lesion. Some mediolaterally elongated Tg(vsx1:GFP)<U+207A> cells contact 
the central canal in a medial position. These cells likely arise from a p2-like
domain of ependymoradial glial progenitor cells, indicated by coexpression of
Pax6 and Nkx6.1, but not DsRed driven by the olig2 promoter in these cells. We
also present evidence that Pax2<U+207A> interneurons are newly generated after a spinal 
lesion, whereas the generation rate for a dorsal population of parvalbuminergic
interneurons is comparatively low. Our results identify the regenerative
potential of different interneuron types for the first time and support a model
in which different progenitor cell domains in distinct dorsoventral positions
around the central canal are activated by a lesion to give rise to diverse
neuronal cell types in the adult zebrafish spinal cord.

Review: keratoconus in Asia.

Kok YO(1), Tan GF, Loon SC.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Ophthalmology,Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National
University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.

Keratoconus is an ectatic corneal disorder for which exciting therapeutic and
diagnostic technologies are emerging. However, its pathogenesis is still
heterogeneous and elusive. We researched overlooked Asian keratoconus data by
literature review of databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Ovid, Google Scholar, Cornea,
and Cochrane) using key words "keratoconus, Asia, epidemiology, treatment, risk
factors, genes" and names of Asian countries. Articles and their references were 
analyzed. Studies showed that keratoconus may be more prevalent, have earlier
onset, and have greater disease progression in certain Asian and non-Asian
ethnicities, particularly Indians, Pakistanis, Middle Easterners, and
Polynesians, compared with white populations. Epidemiological risk factors
include ethnicity, age (younger than 30 years), gender (male), positive family
history, and eye rubbing. Genetic and disease risk factors include atopy, vernal 
keratoconjunctivitis, Down syndrome, pellucid marginal corneal degeneration, VSX1
(visual system homeobox 1) gene, and Leber congenital amaurosis. Differentiation 
of heterogeneous keratoconus subsets with detailed genotype-phenotype
characterization may advance understanding. Comprehensive multiethnic population 
studies with valid large-scale data are needed. New effective treatments (deep
anterior lamellar keratoplasty, intrastromal corneal ring segments, and corneal
collagen cross-linking with riboflavin) are succeeding previous treatments.

R, Jafari F, Greene W, Fakhraie G, Rezvan F, Heidari M.

Iran.

PURPOSE: To evaluate mutations in the visual system homeobox gene 1 (VSX1) and
superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) genes with keratoconus (KTCN), direct sequencing
was performed in an Iranian population.
METHODS: One hundred and twelve autosomal dominant KTCN patients and fifty-two
unaffected individuals from twenty-six Iranian families, as well as one hundred
healthy people as controls were enrolled. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole
blood sample. Then to study the possible linkage between KTCN and six known loci 
linkage analysis was performed using 12 short tandem repeat (STR) markers. Also, 
the entire coding region and intron-exon boundaries of VSX1 and SOD1 were
amplified by the PCR technique in each proband. Subsequently, PCR products were
subjected to direct sequencing. Co-segregation analysis of the identified
mutation was conducted in the family members. An Amplification Refractory
Mutation System PCR (ARMS-PCR) was additionally employed for detection of the
identified mutation in healthy controls.
RESULTS: Linkage analysis of aforementioned loci did not detect evidence for
linkage to KTCN. Direct PCR sequencing revealed two single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs; g.1502T>G and g.9683C>T), as well as two missense mutations 
that have been previously reported (R166W and H244R) in VSX1. We also found three
undescribed SNPs (g.4886G>A, g.4990C>G, and g.9061T>A) in SOD1. The R166W and
H244R mutations were co-segregated in affected family members but not in those
that were unaffected. Moreover, the ARMS-PCR strategy did not detect the
identified mutations in controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a significant association between KTCN patients and
VSX1 genetic alterations (p.R166W and p.H244R). Although our findings support
VSX1 as a plausible candidate gene responsible for keratoconus, other chromosomal
loci and genes could be involved in KTCN development. Taken together, our results
suggest that p.R166W and p.H244R could have possible pathogenic influences on
KTCN.

Rotondo, Italy.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the involvement of Visual System Homeobox 1 (VSX1), Secreted
Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC), Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1), Lysyl
Oxidase (LOX), and Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) in sporadic
and familial keratoconus.
METHODS: Mutational analysis of the five genes was performed by sequencing and
fragment analysis in a large cohort of 302 Italian patients, with a diagnosis of 
keratoconus based on clinical examination and corneal topography. The variants
identified in VSX1 and SPARC were also assessed in the available relatives of the
probands.
RESULTS: A novel mutation p.G239R and previously reported mutations were found in
VSX1. Novel and already reported variants were identified in SPARC and SOD1,
whose pathogenic significance has not been established. No pathogenic variants
have been identified in LOX and TIMP3.
CONCLUSIONS: Molecular analysis of the five genes in a cohort of 225 sporadic and
77 familial keratoconus cases confirms the possible pathogenic role of VSX1
though in a small number of patients; a possible involvement of LOX and TIMP3
could be excluded; and the role played by SOD1 and SPARC in determining the
disease as not been definitively clarified. Further studies are required to
identify other important genetic factors involved in the pathogenesis and
progression of the disease that in the authors' opinion, and according with
several authors, should be considered as a complex disease.

Although retinal bipolar cells represent a morphologically well defined
population of retinal interneurons, very little is known about the developmental 
mechanisms that regulate their processing. Furthermore, the identity of specific 
bipolar cell types that function in distinct visual circuits remains poorly
understood. Here, we show that the homeobox gene Vsx1 is expressed in Type 7 ON
bipolar cells. In the absence of Vsx1, Type 7 bipolar cells exhibit proper
morphological specification but show defects in terminal gene expression. Vsx1 is
required for the repression of bipolar cell-specific markers, including
Calcium-binding protein 5 and Chx10. This contrasts its genetic requirement as an
activator of gene expression in OFF bipolar cells. To assess possible ON
signaling defects in Vsx1-null mice, we recorded specifically from ON-OFF
directionally selective ganglion cells (DSGCs), which cofasciculate with Type 7
bipolar cell terminals. Vsx1-null ON-OFF DSGCs received more sustained excitatory
synaptic input, possibly due to Type 7 bipolar cell defects. Interestingly, in
Vsx1-null mice, the directionally selective circuit is functional but
compromised. Together, these findings indicate that Vsx1 regulates terminal gene 
expression in Type 7 bipolar cells and is necessary for proper ON visual
signaling within a directionally selective circuit.

Requirement for the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor VSX1 in type 3a 
mouse retinal bipolar cell terminal differentiation.

Shi Z(1), Jervis D, Nickerson PE, Chow RL.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, University of Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia,
Canada.

Retinal bipolar cells make up a class of at least 11 distinct interneurons that
have been classified through morphological and molecular approaches. Previous
work has shown that the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor Vsx1 is
essential for the proper development of a subset of these interneurons. In
Vsx1-null mice, bipolar cells are properly specified but exhibit terminal
differentiation defects characterized by reduced expression of OFF bipolar cell
markers and defects in OFF visual signaling. Here, we further examined the role
of Vsx1 in OFF bipolar cells using recently identified cell-type-specific
markers. In contrast to its previously characterized expression in type 2 OFF
bipolar cells, Vsx1 expression was not detected in type 3 OFF bipolar cells, by
either immunohistological or transgenic reporter labeling approaches. This
observation was unexpected given previous findings that Cabp5 immunolabeling of
type 3 bipolar cell axon terminals is reduced in Vsx1-null mice. However, we
observed reduced levels of the type 3a bipolar cell marker
hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 4 (HCN4) in
Vsx1-null mice, which is consistent with a requirement for Vsx1 in type 3 bipolar
cell differentiation. In contrast, expression of the type 3b bipolar cell marker 
regulatory subunit RII-beta of protein kinase A was unchanged. Despite the
absence of Vsx1 in mature type 3 bipolar cells, colabeling of Vsx1 and HCN4 was
observed at postnatal stages. These findings reveal a role for Vsx1 in type 3a
bipolar cells and suggest that Vsx1 function is required transiently in this cell
type during the postnatal period.

High-resolution analysis of DNA copy number alterations in patients with isolated
sporadic keratoconus.

Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. abuamero@gmail.com

PURPOSE: To determine whether patients with sporadic, non-familial keratoconus
and no pathogenic mutations in the visual system homeobox 1 (VSX1) gene have
evidence of chromosomal copy number alterations.
METHODS: Twenty Saudi Arabian patients with isolated keratoconus, no family
history of the disease and no mutations in VSX1 were recruited. Additionally, 10 
ethnically-matched healthy controls were also recruited for this study. We
screened patients for chromosomal copy number aberrations using the Agilent Human
Genome CGH 244A Oligo Microarray Chip.
RESULTS: None of the keratoconus patients screened had evidence of chromosomal
copy number alterations when compared to normal ethnically matched controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Chromosomal deletions and/or duplications were not detected in any
of the patients tested here. Other chromosomal imbalances such as translocations,
inversions, and some ploidies cannot be detected by current array CGH technology 
and other nuclear genetic or epigenetic factors cannot be excluded as a possible 
contributing factor to keratoconus pathogenesis.

Absence of Vsx1 expression in the normal and damaged mouse cornea.

Watson T(1), Chow RL.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada.

PURPOSE: To examine the expression of visual system homeobox 1 (Vsx1) in the
mouse cornea and its potential role in the corneal wound response pathway.
METHODS: Expression of Vsx1 was examined by quantitative reverse-transcription
PCR (qRT-PCR) in corneal tissue from developing and adult mice and from mice that
had undergone alkali-burn corneal wounding. Immunolabeling and Vsx1 knock-in
reporter gene expression in wild type and Vsx1 null-mice were used to confirm the
qRT-PCR data.
RESULTS: Using qRT-PCR, Vsx1 expression was not detected in either the postnatal 
or adult mouse cornea or in corneas following wounding. This qRT-PCR data was
supported by the absence of specific Vsx1 immunolabeling and Vsx1 knock-in
reporter expression in untreated and wounded corneas.
CONCLUSIONS: In mice, Vsx1 mRNA, protein or reporter gene expression is not
detected in the normal or damaged cornea. These results make it uncertain what
role VSX1/Vsx1 plays in corneal biology. Future experiments examining the
pathogenicity of VSX1 mutations associated with corneal dystrophy are required to
rule out species differences and possible non-cell autonomous roles for VSX1 in
the cornea.

PURPOSE: To screen the visual system homebox 1 (VSX1) gene in Saudi Arabian
keratoconus patients.
METHODS: We sequenced the entire coding region, exon-intron boundaries in
clinically confirmed keratoconus patients (n=55) and 50 ethnically matched
healthy controls. All cases and controls were unrelated.
RESULTS: Sequencing VSX1 revealed the presence of five nucleotide changes, 3 of
which were non-coding (g.8326 G>A, g.10945 G>T, and g.11059 A>C) and 2 were
synonymous-coding sequence changes (g.5053 G>T and g.8222 A>G). All five sequence
changes were benign polymorphisms with no apparent clinical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: In our keratoconus cohort, no pathogenic VSX1 mutation(s) were
identified.

Familial segregation of a VSX1 mutation adds a new dimension to its role in the
causation of keratoconus.

Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.

PURPOSE: To look for segregation of Visual System Homeobox 1 (VSX1) mutations in 
family members of a patient with keratoconus.
METHODS: Our initial molecular genetic studies conducted to identify the role of 
VSX1 in the causation of keratoconus had identified a novel mutation in one
patient. He later presented to the clinic affected with vernal kerato
conjunctivitis (VKC) accompanied by his brother, also similarly affected. All the
family members were called and detailed clinical evaluations were undertaken. DNA
from the blood samples of all family members was amplified using primers specific
for VSX1 and analyzed by direct sequencing to look for segregation of the
mutation in the family members. Protein modeling studies were done to assess the 
effect of the mutation on protein structure and function.
RESULTS: Clinical examination of the family revealed bilateral keratoconus and
VKC in the proband and his brother. One of his sisters had VKC without
keratoconus and his parents and another sister were normal. Molecular analysis
identified the VSX1 mutation Q175H in the affected brother and in the mother who 
had neither VKC nor keratoconus but only the VSX1 Q175H sequence change.
CONCLUSIONS: The VSX1 Q175H mutation may be a pathogenic variant with incomplete 
penetrance. Protein modeling studies show that the mutation affects the DNA
binding properties of the protein. This VSX1 variant exhibiting low penetrance
may require the presence of some modifier genes or environmental factors for
disease presentation. VSX1 may have an important role in the pathogenesis of
keratoconus which needs further investigation.

Origin and determination of inhibitory cell lineages in the vertebrate retina.

Author information:

Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 3DY, United Kingdom.

Multipotent progenitors in the vertebrate retina often generate clonally related 
mixtures of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The postmitotically expressed
transcription factor, Ptf1a, is essential for all inhibitory fates in the
zebrafish retina, including three types of horizontal and 28 types of amacrine
cell. Here, we show that specific types of inhibitory neurons arise from the
cell-autonomous influence of Ptf1a in the daughters of fate-restricted
progenitors, such as Ath5 or Vsx1/2-expressing progenitors, and that in the
absence of Ptf1a, cells that would have become these specific inhibitory subtypes
revert to the histogenetically appropriate excitatory subtypes of the same
lineage. Altered proportions of amacrine subtypes respecified by the
misexpression of Ptf1a in the Ath5 lineage suggest that Ath5-expressing
progenitors are biased, favoring the generation of some subtypes more than
others. Yet the full array of inhibitory cell subtypes in Ath5 mutants implies
the existence of Ath5-independent factors involved in inhibitory cell
specification. We also show that an extrinsic negative feedback on the expression
of Ptf1a provides a control mechanism by which the number of any and all types of
inhibitory cells in the retina can be regulated in this lineage-dependent way.

PURPOSE: To screen the visual system homeobox 1 (VSX1) gene in keratoconus
patients.
METHODS: The enntire coding region of VSX1, including intron-exon boundaries were
amplified in keratoconus cases (n=50) and controls (n=50). All sequences were
analyzed against the ensemble sequence (ENSG00000100987) for VXS1.
RESULTS: Sequencing analysis showed four alterations (p.A182A, p.R217H, p.P237P, 
and g.25059612C>T) in VSX1 of which g.25059612C>T (in intron 2) was found to be
novel. Of these four, p.A182A and p.P237P were present in both cases as well as
controls while p.R217H and g.25059612C>T were limited to cases only. All these
changes were non-pathogenic.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study no pathogenic VSX1 mutation was identified. The role of
VSX1 in the pathogenesis of keratoconus is still controversial. VSX1 mutations
are responsible for a very small fraction of all observed keratoconus cases. The 
absence of pathogenic mutations in VSX1 in our patients indicates that other
genetic loci like 13q32 as suggested by a recent study may be involved in the
pathogenesis of this disorder.

Keratoconus (KC) is a bilateral, non-inflammatory, and progredient corneal
ectasia that mostly occurs as a sporadic disorder, but it has long been
recognized that a significant minority of patients also exhibit a family history.
In recent years several candidate genes such as VSX1 and SOD1 have been proposed,
and some disease-causing mutations have been identified. Lately research has also
focused on collagen genes, especially those that are differentially expressed in 
KC cornea. Alterations in COL4A3 and COL4A4 genes may be responsible for
decreases in collagen types I and III, a feature often detected in KC. To
investigate the role of all four genes in 113 Slovenian patients with sporadic or
familial keratoconus, DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction amplification,
and sequencing of both genes were performed. No disease-causing mutations were
found, but two previously identified single nucleotide polymorphisms were
identified (A128A and 627+23G>A) in the VSX1 gene. D326Y in COL4A3 and M1237V and
F1644F in COL4A4 were also found to be significantly associated with KC patients.
The absence of pathogenic mutations in VSX1, SOD1, COL4A3, and COL4A4 genes in
our large number of unrelated keratoconus patients indicates that other genetic
factors are involved in the development of this disorder; nevertheless, a
significant correlation of a few polymorphisms indicates that there could be a
link between specific polymorphisms and KC disease.

Unusual presentation of presumed posterior polymorphous dystrophy associated with
iris heterochromia, band keratopathy, and keratoconus.

Lam HY(1), Wiggs JL, Jurkunas UV.

Author information: 
(1)Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Boston, MA, USA. helene_lam@vmed.org

PURPOSE: To report an unusual presentation of posterior polymorphous corneal
dystrophy (PPCD) associated with band keratopathy, iridocorneal adhesions,
heterochromia, keratoconus, and confocal microscopic findings suggestive of
iridocorneal endothelial syndrome.
METHODS: Confocal microscopy, corneal topography, electroretinography, and
genetic analysis were performed in the proband and his siblings.
RESULTS: A 23-year-old man presented with decreased vision in both eyes over 9
months. Examination revealed bilateral alterations in corneal endothelial mosaic 
with corneal edema and beaten metal appearance in the right eye and cystoid
endothelial opacities in the left eye. Marked heterochromia, band keratopathy,
and broad peripheral anterior synechiae were present in both eyes. Topographic
features of keratoconus were noted. Electroretinography did not detect abnormal
retinal function, as has been described with PPCD associated with VSX1 mutations.
Diagnosis of PPCD was postulated on the basis of the examination of 3 of
proband's brothers by confocal microscopy. Genetic analysis of 3 known PPCD
genes, VSX1, COL8A2, and TCF8, did not detect any mutations.
CONCLUSIONS: In severe cases, PPCD can resemble iridocorneal endothelial
syndromes in both clinical appearance and imaging studies (confocal microscopy). 
There was a strong genetic phenotypic penetrance in the family, which was
essential in the diagnostic decision making. A yet undetermined genotype is
contributing to this unusual PPCD phenotype.

Blimp1 controls photoreceptor versus bipolar cell fate choice during retinal
development.

Brzezinski JA 4th(1), Lamba DA, Reh TA.

Author information: 
(1)University of Washington, Department of Biological Structure, Seattle, WA
98195, USA.

Photoreceptors, rods and cones are the most abundant cell type in the mammalian
retina. However, the molecules that control their development are not fully
understood. In studies of photoreceptor fate determination, we found that Blimp1 
(Prdm1) is expressed transiently in developing photoreceptors. We analyzed the
function of Blimp1 in the mouse retina using a conditional deletion approach.
Developmental analysis of mutants showed that Otx2(+) photoreceptor precursors
ectopically express the bipolar cell markers Chx10 (Vsx2) and Vsx1, adopting
bipolar instead of photoreceptor fate. However, this fate shift did not occur
until the time when bipolar cells are normally specified during development. Most
of the excess bipolar cells died around the time of bipolar cell maturation. Our 
results suggest that Blimp1 expression stabilizes immature photoreceptors by
preventing bipolar cell induction. We conclude that Blimp1 regulates the decision
between photoreceptor and bipolar cell fates in the Otx2(+) cell population
during retinal development.

In recent years, several candidate genes, including VSX1 and SOD1, have been

METHODS: To investigate the role of the 2 genes in 113 Slovenian patients with
sporadic and familial KC, the complete coding region with corresponding intronic 
sequences was analyzed. The same regions of both genes were also checked in 100
healthy blood donors. We also checked the relation of 627+23G>A polymorphism in
the VSX1 gene with the hereditary form of the disease.
RESULTS: No disease-causing mutations were identified in either gene. We did
discover a significant association of 627+23G>A polymorphism distribution (VSX1) 
with unrelated patients diagnosed with the hereditary form of KC.
CONCLUSION: The absence of pathogenic mutations in our large number of unrelated 
patients with KC indicates that other genetic factors are involved in the

Differentiation of neural retinal precursor (NRP) cells in vertebrates follows an
established order of cell-fate determination associated with exit from the cell
cycle. Wnt signaling regulates cell cycle in colon carcinoma cells and has been
implicated in different aspects of retinal development in various species. To
better understand the biological roles of Wnt in the developing retina, we have
used a transgenic and pharmacological approach to manipulate the Wnt signaling
pathway during retinal development in medaka embryos. With the use of both
approaches, we observed that during the early phase of retinal development Wnt
signaling regulated cell cycle progression, proliferation, apoptosis, and
differentiation of NRP cells. However, during later phases of retinal
development, proliferation and apoptosis were not affected by manipulation of Wnt
signaling. Instead, Wnt regulated Vsx1 expression, but not the expression of
other retinal cell markers tested. Thus, the response of NRP cells to Wnt
signaling is stage-dependent.

PURPOSE: Posterior Polymorphous Dystrophy (PPCD) is a genetically heterogeneous
corneal dystrophy, with linkage to three different chromosomal loci, with several
genes in these loci being implicated. The role of both VSX1 and COL8A2 in PPCD
remains controversial but recent work suggests that mutations in the
transcription factor gene ZEB1/TCF8 account for disease in up to 30% of subjects,
with a significant association with connective tissue abnormalities. This study
aimed to determine the phenotype and contribution of ZEB1 mutations in a New
Zealand PPCD population
METHODS: Following informed consent, 11 probands with PPCD underwent extensive
clinical characterization; including a questionnaire to determine birth history, 
general health, and the incidence of connective tissue abnormalities, slit lamp
examination, photography and in vivo confocal microscopy. Family members were
recruited where available. Biological specimens underwent mutational analysis of 
all nine coding exons of ZEB1.
RESULTS: ZEB1 mutational analysis identified one mutation in the 11 probands
(9.1%), a novel mutation in the initiating methionine of exon 1, c.1A-->G that
results in the protein change p.Met1Val, with resultant aberrant initiation of
translation. This mutation segregated with disease in the family, and was not
present in 100 control chromosomes. No other ZEB1 mutations were observed in this
cohort.
CONCLUSION: Recent studies suggest that ZEB1 mutations may account for PPCD in 18
to 30% of cases, with the majority of the mutations in exons 5 and 7. Clinical
and molecular analyses in this New Zealand cohort show a much lower incidence of 
ZEB1 sequence change, confirming the genetic heterogeneity of PPCD. We also
report identification of a novel mutation in the initiating methionine that
removes the Kozak sequence, thereby altering the site of initiation translation.

Cell identity is acquired in different brain structures according to a
stereotyped timing schedule, by accommodating the proliferation of multipotent
progenitor cells and the generation of distinct types of mature nerve cells at
precise times. However, the molecular mechanisms coupling the identity of a
specific neuron and its birth date are poorly understood. In the neural retina,
only late progenitor cells that divide slowly can become bipolar neurons, by the 
activation of otx2 and vsx1 genes. In Xenopus, we found that Xotx2 and Xvsx1
translation is inhibited in early progenitor cells that divide rapidly by a set
of cell cycle-related microRNAs (miRNAs). Through expression and functional
screenings, we selected 4 miRNAs--mir-129, mir-155, mir-214, and mir-222--that
are highly expressed at early developmental stages in the embryonic retina and
bind to the 3' UTR of Xotx2 and Xvsx1 mRNAs inhibiting their translation. The
functional inactivation of these miRNAs in vivo releases the inhibition,
supporting the generation of additional bipolar cells. We propose a model in
which the proliferation rate and the age of a retinal progenitor are linked to
each other and determine the progenitor fate through the activity of a set of
miRNAs.

(1)Laboratory of Cyto-Molecular Genetics, Department of Anatomy, All India
Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the possible role of the VSX1 gene in a group of patients
from the Indian subcontinent with keratoconus.
METHODS: Molecular analysis of 66 patients with a diagnosis of keratoconus, based
on clinical examination and corneal topography, was carried out. DNA extraction
from peripheral blood followed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification
of the VSX1 gene was performed. The entire coding region and the exon-intron
junctions of the VSX1 gene were analyzed by direct sequencing.
RESULTS: A novel change at c.525G>C, replacing amino acid glutamine at position
175 with histidine, was found in one affected individual. One of the previously
reported SNPs (rs12480307) was found with equal frequency in both patients and
controls.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report from the Indian subcontinent exploring the 
role of VSX1 in the causation of keratoconus. One novel mutation (Q175H)
predicted to be a potentially damaging change was seen in an affected individual;
this substantiates the importance of this gene but its precise role in disease
causation needs further investigation.

Reconstruction of a human hemicornea through natural scaffolds compatible with
the growth of corneal epithelial stem cells and stromal keratocytes.

PURPOSE: To reconstruct a human hemicornea in vitro by means of limbal stem cells
cultured onto human keratoplasty lenticules (HKLs) and to obtain a natural
corneal graft for clinical applications.
METHODS: Limbal stem cells were seeded onto HKLs with or without the presence of 
feeder layers of lethally irradiated 3T3-J2 cells and compared with the current
"gold standard" scaffold, i.e., the fibrin glue. The effects of the scaffold on
the preservation of stemness and/or induction of differentiation pathways were
investigated through analysis of a variety of markers, including p63 and
DeltaNp63alpha for stemness, 14-3-3sigma for early differentiation, keratins 3,
14, 12, and 19 to determine cell phenotype, and alpha6, beta1, and beta4
integrins to evaluate interactions with the stroma. Integrity of the stroma was
assessed through analysis of keratan sulfate, CD-34 and aldehyde dehydrogenase
3A1 (ALDH3A1) (for keratocytes), visual system homeobox 1 (VSX1), and
alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) (for fibroblasts and myofibroblasts). The
structural properties of the reconstructed "hemicornea" were investigated through
scanning electron microscopy. To evaluate the preservation of the stemness
potential, cells were trypsinized from each scaffold and clonogenic/proliferative
characteristics analyzed.
RESULTS: Limbal stem cells expanded onto HKLs gave rise to a stratified squamous 
keratinized epithelium morphologically similar to that of normal corneas. The
resulting corneal epithelium was characterized by basal expression of p63 and
DeltaNp63alpha, while expression of 14-3-3sigma, keratin 3, and keratin 12 was
found in the upper cell layers. The basal cuboidal epithelial cells were anchored
to the basement membrane and expressed keratin 14 and alpha6, beta1, and beta4
integrins. In the stroma of HKLs, keratocytes maintained the biosynthetic and
phenotypic appearances typical of resting/quiescent cells and expressed keratan
sulfate, CD-34, and ALDH3A1. Fibroblastic transformation was observed with the
appearance of VSX1 and alpha-SMA. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed
that HKLs maintained their native conformation with collagen fibrils
interconnected to the network and parallel to the corneal surface. HKLs did not
alter the clonogenic/proliferative capacity of limbal stem cells. No differences 
were seen when HKL was compared to fibrin glue, one of the scaffolds currently
used for limbal stem cell transplantation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that HKL could be a suitable scaffold for
corneal epithelial stem cells as they were shown to proliferate, express
differentiation markers, and bind to the underlying stroma with no alterations in
clonogenic potential. HKLs have some advantages over currently used scaffolds,
such as the possibility to allow cell growth with no feeder layers, to be freeze 
dried, and to preserve the integrity and viability of stromal keratocytes. The
development of a tissue-engineered "hemicornea" might offer new therapeutic
perspectives to patients affected by total limbal stem cell deficiency with
stromal scarring.

The homeobox gene CHX10/VSX2 regulates RdCVF promoter activity in the inner
retina.

Rod-derived Cone Viability Factor (RdCVF) is a trophic factor with therapeutic
potential for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa, a retinal disease that
commonly results in blindness. RdCVF is encoded by Nucleoredoxin-like 1 (Nxnl1), 
a gene homologous with the family of thioredoxins that participate in the defense
against oxidative stress. RdCVF expression is lost after rod degeneration in the 
first phase of retinitis pigmentosa, and this loss has been implicated in the
more clinically significant secondary cone degeneration that often occurs. Here, 
we describe a study of the Nxnl1 promoter using an approach that combines
promoter and transcriptomic analysis. By transfection of selected candidate
transcription factors, chosen based upon their expression pattern, we identified 
the homeodomain proteins CHX10/VSX2, VSX1 and PAX4, as well as the zinc finger
protein SP3, as factors that can stimulate both the mouse and human Nxnl1
promoter. In addition, CHX10/VSX2 binds to the Nxnl1 promoter in vivo. Since
CHX10/VSX2 is expressed predominantly in the inner retina, this finding motivated
us to demonstrate that RdCVF is expressed in the inner as well as the outer
retina. Interestingly, the loss of rods in the rd1 mouse, a model of retinitis
pigmentosa, is associated with decreased expression of RdCVF by inner retinal
cells as well as by rods. Based upon these results, we propose an alternative
therapeutic strategy aimed at recapitulating RdCVF expression in the inner
retina, where cell loss is not significant, to prevent secondary cone death and
central vision loss in patients suffering from retinitis pigmentosa.

population.

PURPOSE: To perform mutational screening of the visual system homeobox gene 1
(VSX1; MIM#605020) in patients with sporadic and familial keratoconus
(MIM#148300) in a European population and, for the first time, report the
mutational analysis of the two newly identified VSX1exons.
METHODS: VSX1sequence variants in patients with keratoconus were evaluated by
direct sequencing of the entire coding region, including two novel exons. In
familial keratoconus cases, segregation of potentially pathogenic VSX1variants
was assessed to determine pathogenicity. Transcript analysis was carried out on
splice site and synonymous sequence variants not detected in controls.
RESULTS: A total of 66 unrelated patients with keratoconus from the European
population (27 with familial keratoconus; 39 with sporadic keratoconus) were
analysed for VSX1 mutations. Four sequence variants were not observed in 100
healthy control individuals: c.432C>G (p.D144E), c.479G>A (p.G160D), c.789C>T
(p.S263S), and an intronic change c.844-13T>A (numbered with respect to
NM_014588). Segregation was not detected for p.D144E and c.844-13T>A. The change 
in p.G160D was observed in two patients with sporadic keratoconus. Although
predicted to alter VSX1 splicing, p.S263S had no effect on transcript processing.
Four known SNPs were detected and the following polymorphic variants were
observed in keratoconus patients and controls: c.711T>A (NM_199425; p.P237P),
c.844-5_-6insT (NM_014588), c.*28G>T (DQ854811/DQ854812), and c.*50G>A
(DQ854809/DQ854810).
CONCLUSIONS: VSX1has a minor role in keratoconus pathogenesis. The pathogenicity 
of p.G160D remains controversial and this change may represent a rare
polymorphism or genetic modifier. Further evidence is provided that the
previously reported variant, p.D144E, is a polymorphism.

PURPOSE: With advances in phenotyping tools and availability of molecular
characterization, an increasing number of phenotypically and genotypically
diverse inherited corneal dystrophies are described. We aimed to determine the
underlying causative genetic mechanism in a three-generation pedigree affected
with a unique anterior membrane corneal dystrophy characterized by early onset
recurrent corneal erosions, small discrete focal opacities at the level of Bowman
layer and anterior stroma, anterior stromal flecks, and prominent corneal nerves.
METHODS: Twenty affected and unaffected members of a three-generation family were
examined and extensively clinically characterized including corneal topography
and in vivo confocal microscopy, and biological specimens were collected for DNA 
extraction. Mutational analysis of two corneal genes (TGFBI [Transforming Growth 
factor-beta induced] and ZEB1 [zinc finger E box-binding homeobox 1]) was
undertaken, in addition to testing with the Asper Corneal Dystrophy gene chip
(Asper Ophthalmics, Tartu, Estonia). Subsequent Genotyping To 11 Known Corneal
Gene Loci (COL8A2 [Collagen, Type VIII, Alpha-2], TACSTD2 [Tumor-Associated
Calcium Signal Transducer 2], PIP5K3 [Phosphatidylinositol-3-Phosphate 5-Kinase, 
Type III], GSN [Gelsolin], KERA [Keratocan], VSX1 [Visual System Homeobox Gene
1], COL6A1 [Collagen, Type VI, Alpha-1], MMP9 [Matrix Metalloproteinase 9], KRT3 
[Keratin 3]), and two putative loci, 3p14-q13 and 15q22.33-24) was undertaken
using polymorphic markers, and haplotypes constructed. Multipoint linkage
analysis was performed to generate LOD scores and produce LOD plots across the
candidate intervals.
RESULTS: No pathogenic sequence variations were detected in TGFBI or ZEB1 of the 
proband nor on the Asper Corneal Dystrophy gene chip (302 mutations in 12 genes).
Multipoint linkage analysis of 11 known corneal genes and loci generated negative
LOD plots and was able to exclude all genes tested including PIP5K3.
CONCLUSIONS: Exclusion of linkage to candidate corneal loci combined with an
absence of pathogenic mutations in known corneal genes in this pedigree suggest a
different genetic causative mechanism in this dystrophy than the previously
documented corneal genes. This unique phenotype of an anterior membrane dystrophy
may therefore provide an opportunity to identify a new gene responsible for
corneal disease.

vsx1 3' untranslated region-mediated translation difference at different
developmental stages of goldfish embryos.

Chen J(1), Tong Y, Zhao S, Ma S, Luo C.

Author information: 
(1)College of Life Science, Hunan Normal University, Changsha 410081, China.

Visual system homeobox-1 (vsx1) is important in retinal progenitor proliferation,
differentiation, and function maintenance of bipolar cells in vertebrates. Recent
study in Xenopus laevis has shown that vsx1 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) can
mediate cell-specific translation of vsx1 mRNA in the bipolar cells of the
retinal inner nuclear layer (INL). vsx1 is also transcribed at the early
developmental stages prior to eye formation and its spatiotemporal expression
patterns are conserved in all the examined vertebrates. In order to determine
whether the vsx1 3' UTR has a role in regulating the spatiotemporal expression of
vsx1 during early embryogenesis, we constructed a vsx1 UTR-controlled green
fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene system and examined the GFP expression
pattern in goldfish, Carassius auratus, at different developmental stages. Our
results indicated that both the vsx1 5' UTR and the vsx1 3' UTR remarkably
repressed GFP expression at transcription level but did not regulate
tissue-specific translation at early developmental stages. GFP protein was
ubiquitously expressed in the embryos injected with GFP-sensors containing vsx1
UTRs before 60 h post-fertilization (hpf). From hatching stage (72 hpf) onwards, 
however, GFP protein was specifically expressed in the bipolar cells of the
retinal INL in the vsx1 3'UTR-GFP-sensor embryos, but was still ubiquitously
expressed in the embryos injected with GFP-sensor lacking vsx1 3' UTR. These
observations showed a significant difference of vsx1 3' UTR-mediated translation 
between early and late developmental stages and suggested that vsx1 3' UTR might 
not be involved in regulating the spatiotemporal expression of vsx1 until
hatching stage during embryogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy is the most common disease of the
corneal endothelium. Besides some sporadic cases, an autosomal dominant
inheritance is frequently described. Mutations in the VSX-1 gene are identified
as the underlying gene defect for a rarer kind of endothelial dystrophy,
posterior polymorphous endothelial dystrophy. We report on mutational analysis of
the VSX-1 gene in affected and non-affected family members of three families with
autosomal dominant inherited Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy and one male
patient showing posterior polymorphous endothelial dystrophy.
PATIENTS/MATERIALS AND METHODS: From one patient with posterior polymorphous
endothelial dystrophy and 10 affected and 15 non-affected family members of three
families with autosomal dominant inherited Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy
DNA was extracted from leukocytes of the peripheral blood and mutational analysis
was performed by direct sequencing of the VSX-1 gene.
RESULTS: Screening of the VSX-1 gene did not reveal sequence variants in any
affected or non-affected individuals from the three families with Fuchs
endothelial corneal dystrophy or the patient with posterior polymorphous
endothelial dystrophy.
CONCLUSIONS: The absence of pathogenic mutations in the VSX-1 gene in affected
family members of 3 pedigrees indicates that other genetic factors are involved
in the development of familial Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy. In addition, 
VSX-1 seems unlikely to be the crucial gene in our patient with posterior
polymorphous endothelial dystrophy.

Vsx2 in the zebrafish retina: restricted lineages through derepression.

Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge, CB2 3DY, UK. mspdcv2@cam.ac.uk

BACKGROUND: The neurons in the vertebrate retina arise from multipotent retinal
progenitor cells (RPCs). It is not clear, however, which progenitors are
multipotent or why they are multipotent.
RESULTS: In this study we show that the homeodomain transcription factor Vsx2 is 
initially expressed throughout the retinal epithelium, but later it is
downregulated in all but a minor population of bipolar cells and all Müller glia.
The Vsx2-negative daughters of Vsx2-positive RPCs divide and give rise to all
other cell types in the retina. Vsx2 is a repressor whose targets include
transcription factors such as Vsx1, which is expressed in the progenitors of
distinct non-Vsx2 bipolars, and the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor
Ath5, which restricts the fate of progenitors to retinal ganglion cells,
horizontal cells, amacrine cells and photoreceptors fates. Foxn4, expressed in
the progenitors of amacrine and horizontal cells, is also negatively regulated by
Vsx2.
CONCLUSION: Our data thus suggest Vsx2-positive RPCs are fully multipotent
retinal progenitors and that when Vsx2 is downregulated, Vsx2-negative
progenitors escape Vsx2 repression and so are able to express factors that
restrict lineage potential.

Expression profiling of zebrafish sox9 mutants reveals that Sox9 is required for 
retinal differentiation.

(1)Institute of Neuroscience, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403, USA.

The transcription factor gene Sox9 plays various roles in development, including 
differentiation of the skeleton, gonads, glia, and heart. Other functions of Sox9
remain enigmatic. Because Sox9 protein regulates expression of target genes, the 
identification of Sox9 targets should facilitate an understanding of the
mechanisms of Sox9 action. To help identify Sox9 targets, we used microarray
expression profiling to compare wild-type embryos to mutant embryos lacking
activity for both sox9a and sox9b, the zebrafish co-orthologs of Sox9. Candidate 
genes were further evaluated by whole-mount in situ hybridization in wild-type
and sox9 single and double mutant embryos. Results identified genes expressed in 
cartilage (col2a1a and col11a2), retina (calb2a, calb2b, crx, neurod, rs1, sox4a 
and vsx1) and pectoral fin bud (klf2b and EST AI722369) as candidate targets for 
Sox9. Cartilage is a well-characterized Sox9 target, which validates this
strategy, whereas retina represents a novel Sox9 function. Analysis of mutant
phenotypes confirmed that Sox9 helps regulate the number of Müller glia and
photoreceptor cells and helps organize the neural retina. These roles in eye
development were previously unrecognized and reinforce the multiple functions
that Sox9 plays in vertebrate development.

PURPOSE: Keratoconus (KTCN) is a noninflammatory thinning and anterior protrusion
of the cornea that results in steepening and distortion of the cornea, altered
refractive powers, and reduced visual acuity. Several loci responsible for a
familial form of KTCN have been mapped, however; no mutations in any genes have
been identified for any of these loci. There is also evidence that VSX1 and SOD1 
may be involved in the etiology of KTCN. The purpose of this study was to verify 
the available data and to identify a new keratoconus susceptibility locus.
METHODS: KTCN without other ocular or systemic features was diagnosed in 18
families. VSX1 and SOD1 sequencing was performed on affected individuals and
control subjects. Genomewide linkage analysis was then performed in all families 
using polymorphic microsatellite markers with an average spacing of 5 cM. Next,
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) analysis, and a comparative genomic hybridization array were used in one
family to assess a candidate region on 13q32.
RESULTS: All previously reported KTCN loci were excluded. VSX1 and SOD1 were
sequenced, and no potentially functional variants were found. One KTCN family
yielded a maximum multipoint parametric LOD score of 4.1 and multipoint
nonparametric linkage (NPL) LOD score of 3.2. Multipoint linkage and haplotype
analysis narrowed the locus to a 5.6-Mb region between the SNPs rs9516572 and
rs3825523 on 13q32.
CONCLUSIONS: The results exclude VSX1 and SOD1 as potential disease-causing genes
in these families and localize a novel gene for keratoconus to a 5.6-Mb interval 
on 13q32.

V2a and V2b neurons are generated by the final divisions of pair-producing
progenitors in the zebrafish spinal cord.

The p2 progenitor domain in the ventral spinal cord gives rise to two interneuron
subtypes: V2a and V2b. Delta-Notch-mediated cell-cell interactions between
postmitotic immature neurons have been implicated in the segregation of neuron
subtypes. However, lineage relationships between V2a and V2b neurons have not
been reported. We address this issue using Tg[vsx1:GFP] zebrafish, a model system
in which high GFP expression is initiated near the final stage of p2 progenitors.
Cell fates were followed in progeny using time-lapse microscopy. Results indicate
that the vast majority, if not all, of GFP-labeled p2 progenitors divide once to 
produce V2a/V2b neuron pairs, indicating that V2a and V2b neurons are generated
by the asymmetric division of pair-producing progenitor cells. Together with
evidence that Notch signaling is involved in the cell fate specification process,
our results strongly suggest that Delta-Notch interactions between sister cells
play a crucial role in the final outcome of these asymmetric divisions. This
mechanism for determining cell fate is similar to asymmetric divisions that occur
during Drosophila neurogenesis, where ganglion mother cells divide once to
produce distinct neurons. However, unlike in Drosophila, the divisional axes of
p2 progenitors in zebrafish were not fixed. We report that the terminal division 
of pair-producing progenitor cells in vertebrate neurogenesis can reproducibly
produce two distinct neurons through a mechanism that may not depend on the
orientation of the division axis.

Keratoconus is a bilateral ectatic disorder characterized by the central thinning
of corneal tissue leading to visual impairment. To investigate the possibility of
visual system homeobox 1 (VSXI) as a candidate susceptibility gene for Korean
patients with keratoconus, we performed a mutation screening of the VSXI gene in 
249 unrelated patients with keratoconus and 208 control subjects without the
ocular disorder. We found two heterozygous novel missense mutations in exon 2:
N151S and G160V. The G160V mutation was identified in 13 keratoconus patients
(5.3%), and the N151S mutation was found in only one keratoconus patient (0.4%). 
We also detected three synonymous polymorphisms and four intragenic
polymorphisms. The IVS1-11*a allele was associated with a significantly increased
risk of keratoconus in Korean patients [3.6 vs. 0.5%, p = 0.001, odds ratio (OR) 
= 7.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.989-30.241). Other polymorphisms did not
show an association with keratoconus risk. Our data is the first reported VSX1
mutation screening in Korean keratoconus patients. We detected two novel missense
mutations and one intragenic polymorphism in the VSX1 gene, which show a strong
statistical association with unrelated keratoconus patients. Consequently, our
study suggests that VSX1 gene variants seem to be significant genetic variants
for keratoconus predisposition in unrelated Korean patients.

PURPOSE: To identify the genetic defect associated with keratoconus (KC) in an
Ashkenazi Jewish family and to evaluate its nature and its phenotypic expression 
within carriers.
METHODS: A three generation Ashkenazi Jewish family with KC was ascertained.
Diagnosis was based on clinical examination and corneal topography. Segregation
analysis was performed using micro-satellite polymorphic markers in close
proximity to 7 previously associated KC loci and genes. Mutation analysis of the 
VSX1 gene was performed by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified exons, and a BseR1 
restriction assay. In selected cases, where the genotype was consistent with KC, 
additional effort to detect subtle corneal changes was made by computerized
Orbscan measurements.
RESULTS: We found co-segregation between the KC phenotype and a polymorphic
marker close to the VSX1. Sequencing revealed a previously described missense
mutation (D144E). All of the mutation carriers manifested pathologic corneal
findings; some had overt KC while others had subtle corneal alterations
identifiable only by Orbscan.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the pathogenic role of VSX1 gene in KC. The
variable expression among the carriers, suggests the involvement of other factors
in determining the final phenotype.

Genetic control of circuit function: Vsx1 and Irx5 transcription factors regulate
contrast adaptation in the mouse retina.

Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.

Transcriptional programs guide the specification of neural cell types in the
developing nervous system. However, it is unclear whether such programs also
control specific aspects of neural circuit function at maturity. In the mammalian
retina, Vsx1 and Irx5 transcription factors are present in a subset of bipolar
interneurons that convey signals from photoreceptors to ganglion cells. The
biased expression of Vsx1 and Irx5 in hyperpolarizing OFF compared with
depolarizing ON bipolar cells suggests that these transcription factors may
selectively regulate signal processing in OFF circuits. To test this hypothesis, 
we generated mice lacking both Vsx1 and Irx5. Bipolar cells in these mice were
morphologically normal, but the expression of cell-specific markers in some OFF
but not ON bipolar cells was reduced or absent. To assess visual function in
Vsx1(-/-)Irx5(-/-) retinas, we recorded light responses from ensembles of retinal
ganglion cells (RGCs). We first identified functional RGC types in control mice
and describe their response properties and adaptation to temporal contrast using 
a simple linear-nonlinear model. We found that space-time receptive fields of
RGCs are unchanged in Vsx1(-/-)Irx5(-/-) mice compared with control retinas. In
contrast, response threshold, gain, and range were lowered in a
cell-type-specific manner in OFF but not ON RGCs in Vsx1(-/-)Irx5(-/-) retinas.
Finally, we discovered that the ability to adapt to temporal contrast is greatly 
reduced in OFF RGCs in the double mutant, suggesting that Vsx1 and Irx5 control
specific aspects of visual function in circuits of the mammalian retina.

Genetic analysis of chromosome 20-related posterior polymorphous corneal
dystrophy: genetic heterogeneity and exclusion of three candidate genes.

Hosseini SM(1), Herd S, Vincent AL, Héon E.

Author information: 
(1)Program in Genetics and Genome Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children
Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

PURPOSE: Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD) is a genetically
heterogeneous autosomal dominant condition which maps to the pericentromeric
region of chromosome 20. Mutations in the VSX1 transcription factor have been
reported in patients affected with PPCD, keratoconus, or a combination of both
phenotypes. However, no mutation was identified in the coding region of VSX1 in
the family used for the original mapping. To clarify the genetic basis of PPCD1, 
a thorough analysis was performed on the original PPCD1 family and two other
PPCD1-linked families. As part of the analysis, the expression profile,
transcript variants, and evolutionary conserved regions of VSX1, a key candidate 
gene within the linkage interval, were characterized.
METHODS: Haplotype analysis was performed using highly informative markers on the
pericentromeric region of chromosome 20. VSX1 transcript variants were identified
using RT-PCR and characterized by 3'RACE assay. Temporal expression profile of
VSX1 was evaluated using semi-quantitative real-time RT-PCR on human tissues.
Evolutionary conserved regions (ECRs) were identified in the vicinity of VSX1
using publicly available sequence alignments (UCSC and rVista) and sequenced for 
mutation analysis.
RESULTS: Recombination events were identified that narrow the PPCD1-disease
interval from 20 to 16.44 cM. This smaller interval includes the CHED1 locus and 
a recently described PPCD locus in Czech families. The three strongest candidate 
genes of the PPCD1-CHED1 overlap region (RBBP9, ZNF133, SLC24A3) did not show any
mutations in our PPCD1-linked families. Semi-quantitative real-time RT-PCR
detected VSX1 expression in neonatal human cornea. Six transcript variants of
VSX1 were characterized. Four of the transcript variants spliced to two novel
exons downstream of the gene. Mutation analysis of the PPCD1-linked families did 
not reveal any mutations in the full genomic sequence of VSX1 (considering all
splice variants) or in the six cis- regulatory modules predicted in the vicinity 
of VSX1 (100 kb).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first documentation of VSX1 expression in human neonatal
cornea. We provide evidence for genetic heterogeneity of chromosome 20-related
PPCD and refinement of the original PPCD1 interval. The full genomic sequence of 
VSX1 and coding exons of three other candidate genes were excluded from being
pathogenic in the original PPCD1 family.

Three VSX1 gene mutations, L159M, R166W, and H244R, are not associated with
keratoconus.

PURPOSE: Three mutations, L159M, R166W, and H244R, in the VSX1 gene have been
recently reported to be associated with keratoconus by direct sequencing in
familial panels. In an attempt to confirm this observation, we surveyed the same 
mutations of the VSX1 gene for a white sporadic keratoconus case-control panel
and a larger familial panel to test its association with keratoconus.
METHODS: A case-control panel, with 77 keratoconus patients and 71 healthy
controls, and a keratoconus familial panel, with 444 individuals from 75
families, were surveyed. DNA from each individual was tested for the previously
reported mutations by ABI allelic discrimination technology (L159M and R166W) and
restriction fragment length polymorphism assay (H244R).
RESULTS: We observed no mutations of R166W and H244R and 1 heterozygous mutation 
of L159M in a healthy individual in the case-control panel. For the familial
panel, we observed no polymorphism of R166W; 3 heterozygous for H244R, with 2
affected and 1 unaffected; and 5 heterozygous for L159M, with 3 affected and 2
unaffected.
CONCLUSIONS: We cannot confirm the previously reported association of the
polymorphism in the VSX1 gene with keratoconus. In our case-control sample panel 
and the larger familial sample panel, we did not observe the reported
polymorphism of the VSX1 gene, and the distribution of these 3 polymorphisms was 
not significant enough to support a pathogenetic role in keratoconus.

Islet-1 controls the differentiation of retinal bipolar and cholinergic amacrine 
cells.

Whereas the mammalian retina possesses a repertoire of factors known to establish
general retinal cell types, these factors alone cannot explain the vast diversity
of neuronal subtypes. In other CNS regions, the differentiation of diverse
neuronal pools is governed by coordinately acting LIM-homeodomain proteins
including the Islet-class factor Islet-1 (Isl1). We report that deletion of Isl1 
profoundly disrupts retinal function as assessed by electroretinograms and vision
as assessed by optomotor behavior. These deficits are coupled with marked
reductions in mature ON- and OFF-bipolar (>76%), cholinergic amacrine (93%), and 
ganglion (71%) cells. Mosaic deletion of Isl1 permitted a chimeric analysis of
"wild-type" cells in a predominantly Isl1-null environment, demonstrating a
cell-autonomous role for Isl1 in rod bipolar and cholinergic amacrine
development. Furthermore, the effects on bipolar cell development appear to be
dissociable from the preceding retinal ganglion cell loss, because Pou4f2-null
mice are devoid of similar defects in bipolar cell marker expression. Expression 
of the ON- and OFF-bipolar cell differentiation factors Bhlhb4 and Vsx1,
respectively, requires the presence of Isl1, whereas the early bipolar cell
marker Prox1 initially did not. Thus, Isl1 is required for engaging bipolar
differentiation pathways but not for general bipolar cell specification.
Spatiotemporal expression analysis of additional LIM-homeobox genes identifies a 
LIM-homeobox gene network during bipolar cell development that includes Lhx3 and 
Lhx4. We conclude that Isl1 has an indispensable role in retinal neuron
differentiation within restricted cell populations and this function may reflect 
a broader role for other LIM-homeobox genes in retinal development, and perhaps
in establishing neuronal subtypes.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of the visual system homeobox gene 1 (VSX1) in the 
pathogenesis of familial keratoconus.
METHODS: Families with two or more individuals with keratoconus were recruited
and their members examined. The coding region and intron-exon junctions of the
VSX1 gene were sequenced in affected individuals. In cases where there were
possible pathogenic changes, segregation within the pedigree was analyzed. Meta
analysis of reports on an association of p.D144E change with keratoconus
phenotype was performed.
RESULTS: Probands from a panel of 85 apparently unrelated keratoconus families
were included. Eleven sequence variants were observed, including the previously
reported c.432C>G (p.D144E) change and two novel intronic single nucleotide
polymorphisms. However, these three changes did not cosegregate with the disease 
phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: We excluded the c.432C>G sequence alteration as the direct cause of 
the disease. Lack of possibly pathogenic VSX1 sequence variants in the familial
panel suggests that involvement of this gene in the pathogenesis of keratoconus
is likely to be confined to a small number of pedigrees, at least in the
population studied.

Negative regulation of Vsx1 by its paralog Chx10/Vsx2 is conserved in the
vertebrate retina.

University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.

Chx10/Vsx2 and Vsx1 are the only Paired-like CVC (Prd-L:CVC) homeobox genes in
the mouse genome. Both are expressed in the retina and have important but
distinct roles in retinal development. Mutations in Chx10/Vsx2 cause reduced
retinal progenitor cell (RPC) proliferation and an absence of bipolar cells,
while mutations in Vsx1 impair differentiation of cone bipolar cells. Given their
structural similarities and importance in retinal development, we sought to
determine if a regulatory interaction exists between these genes and whether
inactivation of both genes blocks initiation of retinal development. We found
that Chx10/Vsx2 binds to a specific sequence in the Vsx1 5'-intergenic region and
represses the activity of a luciferase reporter under the control of the Vsx1
promoter. This is consistent with our observation that there is an inverse
relationship between the levels of Chx10/Vsx2 and Vsx1 immunostaining within the 
bipolar cell class. Furthermore, Vsx1 mRNA is upregulated in the RPCs of
Chx10/Vsx2 deficient mice and zebrafish embryos injected with a chx10/vsx2
morpholino. In mice deficient for both Chx10/Vsx2 and Vsx1 and zebrafish embryos 
co-injected with chx10/Vsx2 and vsx1 morpholinos, the changes in embryonic
retinal development and marker expression are similar in magnitude to embryos
with Chx10/Vsx2 loss of function only. From these studies, we propose that Vsx1
is a direct target of Chx10/Vsx2-mediated transcriptional repression. Although
Vsx1 mRNA is upregulated in Chx10/Vsx2 deficient RPCs, Vsx1 does not genetically 
compensate for loss of Chx10/Vsx2, demonstrating that Prd-L:CVC genes, although
important, are not absolutely required to initiate retinal development.

We describe the search for mutations in six unrelated Czech and four unrelated
British families with posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD); a
relatively rare eye disorder. Coding exons and intron/exon boundaries of all
three genes (VSX1, COL8A2, and ZEB1/TCF8) previously reported to be implicated in
the pathogenesis of this disorder were screened by DNA sequencing. Four novel
pathogenic mutations were identified in four families; two deletions, one
nonsense, and one duplication within exon 7 in the ZEB1 gene located at 10p11.2. 
We also genotyped the Czech patients to test for a founder haplotype and lack of 
disease segregation with the 20p11.2 locus we previously described. Although a
systematic clinical examination was not performed, our investigation does not
support an association between ZEB1 changes and self reported non-ocular
anomalies. In the remaining six families no disease causing mutations were
identified thereby indicating that as yet unidentified gene(s) are likely to be
responsible for PPCD.

PURPOSE: To characterize the expression of the visual system homeobox gene (VSX1)
in human corneal keratocytes both in vitro and in vivo.
METHODS: The expression of VSX1 was evaluated through semiquantitative RT-PCR,
immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization both in corneas (either freshly
obtained or wounded) and in collagenase/hyaluronidase-isolated keratocytes grown 
in the absence or presence of serum to promote keratocyte-to-myofibroblast
differentiation.
RESULTS: Quiescent or resting keratocytes normally residing in the corneal stroma
or cultured in vitro in the absence of serum did not express VSX1. In wounded
corneas or when cultured in the presence of serum to mimic wound-healing
responses, keratocytes underwent fibroblastic transformation (with appearance of 
alpha-SMA and disappearance of CD-34 and keratocan signals) and started
expressing VSX1.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that VSX1 is expressed in vitro and in vivo during 
human corneal wound healing, a process in which differentiation of corneal
keratocytes into myofibroblasts occurs. These data may help to elucidate the role
of VSX1 in cornea physiology suggesting a potential involvement in cornea-related
diseases such as keratoconus.

In contrast to the high degree of evolutionary conservation of the Vsx2/Chx10
gene family, vertebrate orthologues of Vsx1 display more divergent sequences and 
spatio-temporal expression patterns. Here, we report the cloning and expression
pattern of Xenopus laevis Vsx1. Differently from the mouse and zebrafish
orthologues, Xvsx1 transcription is activated at early neurula both in the
evaginating eye vesicles and in the presumptive spinal cord. Compared to other
retinal homeobox genes, such as Xrx1, Xsix3 and Xpax6, Xvsx1 is activated at a
later stage; in addition, its anterior expression appears to be more specifically
restricted to the retina. At tail bud stage, Xvsx1 expression in retinal
progenitors persists, and its neural tube expression, which in the spinal cord
corresponds to interneurons, progressively expands anteriorly reaching the
midbrain-hindbrain boundary. During retinal neurogenesis, Xvsx1 expression is
maintained in retinal progenitors and in a peripheral region of the ciliary
marginal zone, while in the central retina, it becomes restricted to
differentiated bipolar cells.

Timing the generation of distinct retinal cells by homeobox proteins.

Comment in
    PLoS Biol. 2006 Sep;4(9):e293.

The reason why different types of vertebrate nerve cells are generated in a
particular sequence is still poorly understood. In the vertebrate retina,
homeobox genes play a crucial role in establishing different cell identities.
Here we provide evidence of a cellular clock that sequentially activates distinct
homeobox genes in embryonic retinal cells, linking the identity of a retinal cell
to its time of generation. By in situ expression analysis, we found that the
three Xenopus homeobox genes Xotx5b, Xvsx1, and Xotx2 are initially transcribed
but not translated in early retinal progenitors. Their translation requires cell 
cycle progression and is sequentially activated in photoreceptors (Xotx5b) and
bipolar cells (Xvsx1 and Xotx2). Furthermore, by in vivo lipofection of "sensors"
in which green fluorescent protein translation is under control of the 3'
untranslated region (UTR), we found that the 3' UTRs of Xotx5b, Xvsx1, and Xotx2 
are sufficient to drive a spatiotemporal pattern of translation matching that of 
the corresponding proteins and consistent with the time of generation of
photoreceptors (Xotx5b) and bipolar cells (Xvsx1 and Xotx2). The block of cell
cycle progression of single early retinal progenitors impairs their
differentiation as photoreceptors and bipolar cells, but is rescued by the
lipofection of Xotx5b and Xvsx1 coding sequences, respectively. This is the first
evidence to our knowledge that vertebrate homeobox proteins can work as effectors
of a cellular clock to establish distinct cell identities.

Keratoconus is a bilateral, non-inflammatory and progredient corneal ectasia with
an incidence of approximately 1 per 2,000 in the general population. Within the
second decade of life the cornea develops a conical shape, due to thinning of the
corneal stroma with subsequent irregular astigmatism and myopia leading to marked
impairment of vision. The most common presentation of the keratoconus is as a
sporadic disorder, but it has long been recognized that a significant minority of
patients exhibit a family history as an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.
Most investigators suggest complete penetrance of predisposing factors with
variable phenotypic expression. In some patients heterozygous mutations in the
VSX1 gene are described as the underlying gene defect. An association with Down
syndrome, monosomia X (Turner syndrome), Leber's congenital amaurosis, mitral
valve prolaps, collagenosis, retinitis pigmentosa and Marfan syndrome is
described. The role of corneal cells in the pathogenesis of keratoconus is
supported by the published reports of recurrence of keratoconus in eyes after
penetrating keratoplasty due to graft repopulation by the recipient cells.
Placido-based computeed videokeratographic corneal curvature mapping systems,
linked with pachymetry, are useful for identifying overt and subclinical cases of
keratoconus. Different indices may quantify the clinical features of keratoconus 
and may improve the classification. We compared videokeratometric data (Fourier
series harmonic analysis and wavefront analysis) in eyes with keratoconus to
answer the question of which parameters are useful for early diagnosis of
keratoconus.

PURPOSE: To determine whether mutations of the VSX1 gene play a pathogenetic role
in the development of keratoconus (KTCN).
METHODS: DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and direct sequencing of the VSX1
gene were performed in 100 unrelated patients with diagnoses of clinical and
topographic features of KTCN.
RESULTS: Of the four previously identified presumed pathogenic mutations in the
VSX1 gene (Leu17Pro, Asp144Glu, Leu159Met, and Arg166Trp), only Asp144Glu was
identified in a single affected patient. Two novel single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), both resulting in synonymous substitutions, were
identified: c.53G>T (Ser6Ser) in four affected patients and c.209G>T (Pro58Pro)
in two affected patients. Two previously reported SNPs were also identified:
c.426C>A (Arg131Ser) in one affected patient and c.581A>G (Ala182Ala) in 51 of
the 100 affected patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Only one of the presumed pathogenic mutations in the VSX1 gene,
Asp144Glu, was identified in a single member of the cohort of affected patients. 
However, as previously demonstrated, Asp144Glu is a non-disease-causing
polymorphism. The absence of pathogenic mutations in the VSX1 gene in a large
number of unrelated KTCN patients indicates that other genetic factors are
involved in the development of this disorder.

PURPOSE: To elucidate the retinal dysfunction and the molecular basis of
posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD) associated with macular
dystrophy, both inherited in a dominant manner through a three-generation family.
METHODS: Ophthalmologic examinations including slit lamp examination, visual
acuity tests, fundus visualization by scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, fluorescein 
angiography, color vision tests, electro-oculography, photopic and scotopic
electroretinography (ERG) according to the International Society for Clinical
Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) protocols, and oscillatory potential (OP)
recordings were conducted on affected family members. Corneal button from one
affected patient was examined by transmission electron microscopy. All exons and 
intron-exon boundaries of the VSX1 and the COL8A2 genes were amplified by
polymerase chain reaction and sequenced.
RESULTS: The presence of endothelial cells that have epithelial-like features
with multiple layers, desmosomal junctions, and microvillous projections supports
the diagnosis of PPCD. Sequence analysis indicated that the H244R variant in the 
VSX1 segregated with corneal and macular disease phenotypes in this family.
Electrophysiologic studies indicated normal scotopic ERG findings, decreased
amplitude of the photopic b-wave, photopic OP2 and OP3 barely recordable with a
preserved OP4 amplitude, and variably decreased 30-Hz flicker amplitude.
CONCLUSIONS: The human VSX1 is required for cone ON bipolar cell function but not
for rod and cone OFF bipolar cells, giving a unique example of such a selective
heritable retinal defect in humans. Furthermore, the authors provide the first
clinical support for a new alternative role of VSX1 in cone biology, probably
similar to that proposed for its goldfish ortholog during retinal
differentiation.

PURPOSE: Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD) is an autosomal dominant
disorder, affecting both the corneal endothelium and Descemet's membrane. In the 
Czech Republic, PPCD is one of the most prevalent corneal dystrophies. The
purpose of this study was to determine the chromosomal locus of PPCD in two large
Czech families, by using linkage analysis.
METHODS: Linkage analysis was performed on 52 members of two Czech families with 
PPCD and polymorphic microsatellite markers and lod scores were calculated. The
candidate gene VSX1 was also screened for mutations.
RESULTS: Significant lod scores were obtained with microsatellite markers on
chromosome 20. Linkage analysis delineated the Czech PPCD locus to a 2.7-cM locus
on chromosome 20, region p11.2, between flanking markers D20S48 and D20S139,
which excluded VSX1 as the disease-causing gene in both families. In addition,
the exclusion of VSX1 was confirmed by sequence analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the localization of PPCD in patients of Czech
origin to chromosome 20 at p11.2. Linkage data and sequence analysis exclude VSX1
as causative of PPCD in two Czech families. This refined locus for PPCD overlaps 
the congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED1) disease interval, and it 
is possible that these corneal dystrophies are allelic.

Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD, also known as PPMD) is a rare
disease involving metaplasia and overgrowth of corneal endothelial cells. In
patients with PPCD, these cells manifest in an epithelial morphology and gene
expression pattern, produce an aberrant basement membrane, and, sometimes, spread
over the iris and nearby structures in a way that increases the risk for
glaucoma. We previously mapped PPCD to a region (PPCD3) on chromosome 10
containing the gene that encodes the two-handed zinc-finger homeodomain
transcription factor TCF8. Here, we report a heterozygous frameshift mutation in 
TCF8 that segregates with PPCD in the family used to map PPCD3 and four different
heterozygous nonsense and frameshift mutations in TCF8 in four other PPCD
probands. Family reports of inguinal hernia, hydrocele, and possible bone
anomalies in affected individuals suggest that individuals with TCF8 mutations
should be examined for nonocular anomalies. We detect transcripts of all three
identified PPCD genes (VSX1, COL8A2, and TCF8) in the cornea. We show presence of
a complex (core plus secondary) binding site for TCF8 in the promoter of Alport
syndrome gene COL4A3, which encodes collagen type IV alpha 3, and we present
immunohistochemical evidence of ectopic expression of COL4A3 in corneal
endothelium of the proband of the original PPCD3 family. Identification of TCF8
as the PPCD3 gene provides a valuable tool for the study of critical gene
regulation events in PPCD pathology and suggests a possible role for TCF8
mutations in altered structure and function of cells lining body cavities other
than the anterior chamber of the eye. Thus, this study has identified TCF8 as the
gene responsible for approximately half of the cases of PPCD, has implicated TCF8
mutations in developmental abnormalities outside the eye, and has presented the
TCF8 regulatory target, COL4A3, as a key, shared molecular component of two
different diseases, PPCD and Alport syndrome.

development.

In the mouse retina, at least ten distinct types of bipolar interneurons are
involved in the transmission of visual signals from photoreceptors to ganglion
cells. How bipolar interneuron diversity is generated during retinal development 
is poorly understood. Here, we show that Irx5, a member of the Iroquois homeobox 
gene family, is expressed in developing bipolar cells starting at postnatal day 5
and is localized to a subset of cone bipolar cells in the mature mouse retina. In
Irx5-deficient mice, defects were observed in the expression of some, but not
all, immunohistological markers that define mature Type 2 and Type 3 OFF cone
bipolar cells, indicating a role for Irx5 in bipolar cell differentiation. The
differentiation of these two bipolar cell types has previously been shown to
require the homeodomain-CVC transcription factor, Vsx1. However, the defects
observed in Irx5-deficient retinas do not coincide with a reduction of Vsx1
expression, and conversely, the expression of Irx5 in cone bipolar cells does not
require the presence of a functional Vsx1 allele. These results indicate that
there are at least two distinct genetic pathways (Irx5-dependent and
Vsx1-dependent) regulating the development of Type 2 and Type 3 cone bipolar
cells.

Expression of rinx/vsx1 during postnatal eye development in cone-bipolar,
differentiating ganglion, and lens fiber cells.

PURPOSE: To investigate the expression pattern of the homeobox transcription
factor Rinx (also referred to as Vsx1) during postnatal eye development of the
mouse.
METHODS: We cloned the mouse Rinx gene, inferred the sequence of the encoded
protein, and prepared polyclonal antibodies against it. Immunohistochemical
analysis (IHC) and in situ hybridization were employed to localize Rinx in
postnatal and adult mouse eyes. Double-labeled IHC either with anti-protein
kinase C (PKC, a marker of rod bipolar cells) or anti-vimentin (a marker of
Muller glial cells) antibodies was performed in the adult retina. Rinx mRNA was
also analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in the lens.
RESULTS: At P0 and P4 (postnatal days), Rinx-immunoreactive cells included
retinal ganglion cells (RGC), cells of the innermost nuclear layer (INL) and of
presumptive INL, differentiating lens fiber cells, and a few cells of the
presumptive outer nuclear layer (ONL). At P8, both Rinx protein and mRNA were
detected in the middle of the INL, and in RGC, but not in the lens. When the mice
were 8 weeks of age, only a subset of nuclei in the outer half of the INL
expressed both Rinx protein and mRNA. Double-labeling IHC indicated that Rinx-
and either PKC- or vimentin-labeled cells were not colocalized. Therefore, Rinx
is most likely expressed in adult cone bipolar cells and possibly in horizontal
cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Rinx may play important roles in the differentiation and maintenance
of cone bipolar cells. Rinx is unique among members of this family of homeodomain
proteins in that it may also be involved in differentiation of RGC and lens fiber
cells.

Nuclear export is evolutionarily conserved in CVC paired-like homeobox proteins
and influences protein stability, transcriptional activation, and extracellular
secretion.

Homeodomain transcription factors control a variety of essential cell fate
decisions during development. To understand the developmental regulation by these
transcription factors, we describe here the molecular analysis of paired-like CVC
homeodomain protein (PLC-HDP) trafficking. Complementary experimental approaches 
demonstrated that PLC-HDP family members are exported by the Crm1 pathway and
contain an evolutionary conserved leucine-rich nuclear export signal.
Importantly, inactivation of the nuclear export signal enhanced protein
stability, resulting in increased transactivation of transfected reporters and
decreased extracellular secretion. In addition, PLC-HDPs harbor a conserved
active nuclear import signal that could also function as a protein transduction
domain. In our study, we characterized PLC-HDPs as mobile nucleocytoplasmic
shuttle proteins with the potential for unconventional secretion and
intercellular transfer. Nucleocytoplasmic transport may thus represent a
conserved control mechanism to fine-tune the transcriptional activity of PLC-HDPs
prerequisite for regulating and maintaining the complex expression pattern during
development.

Angeles, California 90095, USA. aldave@jsei.ucla.edu

PURPOSE: To perform candidate gene screening for posterior polymorphous corneal
dystrophy (PPCD). The initial 3 genes chosen, ID1, BCL2L1, and VSX1, lie within
the region on chromosome 20 to which the PPCD gene has been linked, and mutations
in VSX1 have previously been identified in patients with PPCD.
METHODS: DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and direct sequencing of the VSX1,
BCL2L1, and ID1 genes were performed in 14 affected patients (12 families) as
well as in unaffected family members and healthy control subjects.
RESULTS: No coding region mutations in the BCL2L1 or ID1 genes were identified in
affected patients. In the VSX1 gene, the previously identified Gly160Asp missense
change was not present in any of our 12 probands, and the Asp144Glu mutation was 
identified in 1 affected patient as well as 1 unaffected control individual.
Additionally, 2 synonymous substitutions were identified, Ala182Ala (8 affected
patients from 8 families) and Gly239Gly (1 affected patient and 1 unaffected
patient from the same family). In the ID1 gene, the synonymous substitution
Gly216Gly was observed in 2 affected patients (2 families) who also demonstrated 
a single nucleotide change in both the 5'UTR (2129T>C) and 3'UTR (3267A>G).
Another 5'UTR change, 2177T>C, was identified in 1 affected patient and his
unaffected parent, both of whom also demonstrated the 2129T>C and 3267A>G
changes.
CONCLUSIONS: None of the 12 probands with PPCD demonstrated the previously
described Gly160Asp mutation within the VSX1 gene. The Asp144Glu missense change,
present in an affected patient as well as an unaffected control individual,
appears to be a rare polymorphism, not a disease-causing mutation. No coding
region changes were identified in the ID1 or BCL2L1 genes. Therefore, although we
report a number of novel polymorphisms in the VSX1 and ID1 genes, the failure to 
identify any sequence variants that sort with the disease phenotype suggests that
other genetic factors are involved in PPCD.

Two ribeye genes in teleosts: the role of Ribeye in ribbon formation and bipolar 
cell development.

Wan L(1), Almers W, Chen W.

Author information: 
(1)Vollum Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon

Ribeye is the only known protein specific to synaptic ribbon, but its function is
unclear. We show that the teleost fish, Fugu and zebrafish, have two ribeye
genes, ribeye a and ribeye b. Whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that
ribeye a is expressed in tissues containing synaptic ribbons, including the
pineal gland, inner ear, and retina. Ribeye b is absent in the pineal gland. In
the retina, ribeye a is expressed in both photoreceptors and bipolar cells,
whereas ribeye b is detected only in photoreceptors. To study the function of
Ribeye a in retina, we depleted it by morpholino antisense oligos. Fish deficient
in Ribeye a lack an optokinetic response and have shorter synaptic ribbons in
photoreceptors and fewer synaptic ribbons in bipolar cells. Their bipolar cells
still target Syntaxin-3 proteins to the inner plexiform layer and have abundant
vsx1 mRNA. However, they lack large synaptic terminals and show increased
apoptosis. Rod bipolar cells are fewer in number and/or deficient in PKCalpha.
Recovery of Ribeye a levels rescues the optokinetic response, increases the
number of PKCalpha-positive bipolar cells, and stops apoptosis. We conclude that 
Ribeye a is important for late steps in bipolar cell development.

Transcriptional activity of the paired-like homeodomain proteins CHX10 and VSX1.

Dorval KM(1), Bobechko BP, Ahmad KF, Bremner R.

Author information: 
(1)Toronto Western Research Institute, University Health Network Program,
University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5T 2S8, Canada.

CHX10 and VSX1 are homeodomain (HD) proteins essential for normal retinal
development. CHX10 is required first for retinal progenitor cell proliferation
and later for bipolar cell differentiation, whereas VSX1 is important in the
terminal differentiation of a subset of bipolar cells. Elucidating the
transcriptional activity of CHX10 and VSX1 is required to understand how these
factors control retinal development. We show that CHX10 and Vsx1 can function as 
transcriptional repressors. When tethered to a promoter by a heterologous LexA
DNA-binding domain or its HD, CHX10 repressed multiple classes of activators in
different immortalized cell lines. CHX10 blocked TATA-containing and TATA-less
promoters, repressed at a distance, and inhibited a complex enhancer positioned
upstream or downstream of the reporter gene, whereas retinoblastoma protein (RB) 
inhibited the downstream enhancer only. Interestingly, CHX10 mildly potentiated a
subset of activators in chick neuronal cultures. Thus, CHX10 is both a versatile 
repressor and a context-specific weak activator. The CHX10 HD and CVC domains
were sufficient for DNA binding and repression. VSX1 contains closely related
homeo and CVC domains and, like CHX10, also repressed transcription. A VSX1 HD
mutation, R166W, that impairs DNA binding and causes keratoconus in humans,
hindered repressor function. Therefore, CHX10 and VSX1 may control retinal
bipolar cell specification or differentiation by repressing genes required for
the development of other cell types.

Giovanni Rotondo (Fg), Italy.

PURPOSE: Keratoconus is a noninflammatory corneal disorder that is clinically and
genetically heterogeneous. Mutations in the VSX1 (visual system homeobox 1) gene 
have been identified for two distinct, inherited corneal dystrophies: posterior
polymorphous corneal dystrophy and keratoconus. To evaluate the possible role of 
the VSX1 gene in a series of Italian patients, 80 keratoconus-affected subjects
were screened for mutations.
METHODS: The diagnosis of keratoconus was made on the basis of clinical
examination and corneal topography. The whole coding region and the exon-intron
junctions of the VSX1 gene were analyzed by direct sequencing.
RESULTS: Three already-described changes, D144E, G160D, and P247R, and a novel
L17P mutation were found in 7 of 80 unrelated patients (8.7%). Two undescribed
intronic polymorphisms are also reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Mutational analysis of the VSX1 gene in a series of Italian patients
revealed one novel mutation and confirmed an important role played by this gene
in a significant proportion of patients affected by keratoconus, when it is
inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with variable expressivity and
incomplete penetrance.

PURPOSE: To present a previously unreported African American family with 1
variation and 1 mutation of the homeobox transcription factor gene, VSX1 (RINX), 
and to describe the clinical features of family members.
DESIGN: Family genotype and clinical studies.
PARTICIPANTS: A 3-generation family with 7 available family members.
METHODS: Blood was drawn from all available family members, and the VSX1 (RINX)
gene was sequenced. Craniofacial abnormalities, central nervous system defects,
anterior segment features, and retinal and auditory function were assessed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcome measures included identification and
molecular characterization of 1 variation and 1 mutation in VSX1 (RINX) of 4
affected family members (3 adults and 1 child). Craniofacial features were
documented. Central neuroimaging was performed. Ophthalmologic findings were
described. Retinal and auditory functions were quantified.
RESULTS: Two changes in VSX1 (RINX) were identified: a variation (R131S) not in a
critical region and in few controls, and a mutation (A256S) in the critical
CVC-domain and not in any controls. Both were present on 1 chromosome at 20p11.2 
and were segregated with the 4 affected patients. Clinical features demonstrated 
extremely variable expressivity. Craniofacial features, including wide
interpupillary distance and unusual pinnae, occurred in the 4 affected patients. 
Neuroimaging demonstrated that the propositus had an empty sella turcica, a
posterior fossa cyst, an anterior encephalocele, hypertelorism, and severe
hydrocephalus; her mother had a partially empty sella turcica, a small pituitary 
gland without any subarachnoid extension of fluid, and hypertelorism; and her
older sister had hypertelorism but otherwise normal neuroimaging results.
Anterior segment anomalies of the corneal endothelium were a constant finding in 
all affected family members. Electrophysiologic examination provided evidence for
abnormal cone bipolar cells (visual evoked response and electroretinogram) in the
adult affected patients and for abnormal auditory bipolar cells (audiogram and
audio-evoked brainstem response) in the propositus.
CONCLUSIONS: The new mutation in the VSX1 (RINX) gene described in this report
results in abnormal craniofacial features, absence of the roof of the sella
turcica, and anomalous development of the corneal endothelium. This mutation also
impacts on the maintenance of cone bipolar cells of the visual system and of
bipolar cells of the auditory system.

Regulation of retinal cone bipolar cell differentiation and photopic vision by
the CVC homeobox gene Vsx1.

Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

Cone bipolar cells of the vertebrate retina connect photoreceptors with ganglion 
cells to mediate photopic vision. Despite this important role, the mechanisms
that regulate cone bipolar cell differentiation are poorly understood. VSX1 is a 
CVC domain homeoprotein specifically expressed in cone bipolar cells. To
determine the function of VSX1, we generated Vsx1 mutant mice and found that Vsx1
mutant retinal cells form but do not differentiate a mature cone bipolar cell
phenotype. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that Vsx1 mutant mice have
defects in their cone visual pathway, whereas the rod visual pathway was
unaffected. Thus, Vsx1 is required for cone bipolar cell differentiation and
regulates photopic vision perception.

Retinal bipolar cells are interneurons that transmit visual signals from
photoreceptors to ganglion cells. Although the visual pathways mediated by
bipolar cells have been well characterized, the genes that regulate their
development and function are largely unknown. To determine the role in bipolar
cell development of the homeobox gene Vsx1, whose retinal expression is
restricted to a major subset of differentiating and mature cone bipolar (CB)
cells, we targeted the gene in mice. Bipolar cell fate was not altered in the
absence of Vsx1 function, because the pan-bipolar markers Chx10 and Ret-B1
continued to be expressed in inner nuclear layer neurons labeled by the
Vsx1-targeting reporter gene, tauLacZ. The specification, number, and gross
morphology of the subset of on-center and off-center (OFF)-CB cells defined by
tauLacZ expression from the Vsx1 locus were also normal in
Vsx1(tauLacZ)/Vsx1(tauLacZ) mice. However, the terminal differentiation of OFF-CB
cells in the retina of Vsx1(tauLacZ)/Vsx1(tauLacZ) mice was incomplete, as
demonstrated by a substantial reduction in the expression of at least four
markers (recoverin, NK3R, Neto1, and CaB5) for these interneurons. These
molecular abnormalities were associated with defects in retinal function and
documented by electroretinography and in vitro ganglion cell recordings specific 
to cone visual signaling. In particular, there was a general reduction in the
light-mediated activity of OFF, but not on-center, ganglion cells. Thus, Vsx1 is 
required for the late differentiation and function of OFF-CB cells and is
associated with a heritable OFF visual pathway-specific retinal defect.

We identified mutations in the VSX1 homeobox gene for two distinct inherited
corneal dystrophies; posterior polymorphous dystrophy (PPD) and keratoconus. One 
of the mutation (R166W) responsible for keratoconus altered the homeodomain and
impaired DNA binding. Two other sequence changes (L159M and G160D) were
associated with keratoconus and PPD, respectively, and involved a region adjacent
to the homeodomain. The G160D substitution, and a fourth defect affecting the
highly conserved CVC domain (P247R), occurred in a child with very severe PPD who
required a corneal transplant at 3 months of age. In this family, relatives with 
the G160D change alone had mild to moderate PPD, while P247R alone caused no
corneal abnormalities. However, with either the G160D or P247R mutation,
electroretinography detected abnormal function of the inner retina, where VSX1 is
expressed. These data define the molecular basis of two important corneal
dystrophies and reveal the importance of the CVC domain in the human retina.

Vsx1, a rapidly evolving paired-like homeobox gene expressed in cone bipolar
cells.

The paired-like homeodomain (HD) protein Chx10 is distinguished by the presence
of the CVC domain, a conserved 56 amino acid sequence C-terminal to the HD. In
mammals, Chx10 is essential both for the proliferation of retinal progenitor
cells and for the formation or survival of retinal bipolar interneurons. We
describe the cloning and characterization of a mouse Chx10 homologue, Vsx1;
phylogenetic analysis suggests that Vsx1 and its putative vertebrate orthologues 
have evolved rapidly. Vsx1 expression in the adult is predominantly retinal.
Whereas Chx10 is expressed both in retinal progenitors in the developing eye and 
apparently in all bipolar cells of the mature retina, Vsx1 expression is first
detected in the eye at postnatal day 5, where it is restricted to cone bipolar
cells.

The complete absence of eyes in the medaka fish mutation eyeless is the result of
defective optic vesicle evagination. We show that the eyeless mutation is caused 
by an intronic insertion in the Rx3 homeobox gene resulting in a transcriptional 
repression of the locus that is rescued by injection of plasmid DNA containing
the wild-type locus. Functional analysis reveals that Six3- and Pax6- dependent
retina determination does not require Rx3. However, gain- and loss-of-function
phenotypes show that Rx3 is indispensable to initiate optic vesicle evagination
and to control vesicle proliferation, by that regulating organ size. Thus, Rx3
acts at a key position coupling the determination with subsequent morphogenesis
and differentiation of the developing eye.

Isolation and characterization of Vsx1, a novel mouse CVC paired-like homeobox
gene expressed during embryogenesis and in the retina.

Gastrula stage mouse embryo RNA was screened by degenerate RT-PCR to yield a
novel paired-like homeobox gene. The open reading frame encoded by the cDNA was
most similar to human VSX1. Mouse Vsx1 encodes a protein of 363 amino acid
residues that contains a CVC domain that was originally identified as a conserved
motif among mouse CHX10, goldfish VSX-1 and C. elegans CEH-10. Linkage analysis
showed that mouse Vsx1 mapped to the distal region of chromosome 2. RT-PCR
analysis detected mouse Vsx1 transcripts from gastrulation and post-gastrulation 
stage mouse embryos, suggesting a role for Vsx1 during mouse embryogenesis.
Analysis of the eyes of mouse chimeras generated with embryonic stem cells in
which a lacZ reporter was targeted to the Vsx1 locus suggested that Vsx1 is

Vsx-1 is a paired-like:CVC homeobox gene whose expression is linked to bipolar
cell differentiation during zebrafish retinogenesis. We used a yeast two-hybrid
screen to identify proteins interacting with Vsx-1 and isolated Ubc9, an enzyme
that conjugates the small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO-1. Despite its interaction
with Ubc9, we show that Vsx-1 is not a substrate for SUMO-1 in COS-7 cells or in 
vitro. When a yeast two-hybrid assay is used, deletion analysis of the
interacting domain on Vsx-1 shows that Ubc9 binds to a nuclear localization
signal (NLS) at the NH(2) terminus of the homeodomain. In SW13 cells, Vsx-1
localizes to the nucleus and is excluded from nucleoli. Deletion of the NLS
disrupts this nuclear localization, resulting in a diffuse cytoplasmic
distribution of Vsx-1. In SW13 AK1 cells that express low levels of endogenous
Ubc9, Vsx-1 accumulates in a perinuclear ring and colocalizes with an endoplasmic
reticulum marker. However, NLS-tagged STAT1 protein exhibits normal nuclear
localization in both SW13 and SW13 AK1 cells, suggesting that nuclear import is
not globally disrupted. Cotransfection of Vsx-1 with Ubc9 restores Vsx-1 nuclear 
localization in SW3 AK1 cells and demonstrates that Ubc9 is required for the
nuclear localization of Vsx-1. Ubc9 continues to restore nuclear localization
even after a C93S active site mutation has eliminated its SUMO-1-conjugating
ability. These results suggest that Ubc9 mediates the nuclear localization of
Vsx-1, and possibly other proteins, through a nonenzymatic mechanism that is
independent of SUMO-1 conjugation.

RINX(VSX1), a novel homeobox gene expressed in the inner nuclear layer of the
adult retina.

The locus control region (LCR) of the human red and green visual pigment genes is
critical for the formation of functional red and green cones in the retina. A
37-bp core of the LCR is perfectly conserved among mammals and binds specific
retinal nuclear proteins. Here, we employed a yeast one-hybrid screen of an adult
retinal cDNA library to clone and characterize these proteins. We identified
clones encoding homeodomain (HD) transcription factors Pax6, Rx, and Chx10 and a 
novel paired-like HD protein, RINX. In the adult retina, RINX is exclusively
expressed in a subset of cells (likely to be bipolar cells) of the retinal inner 
nuclear layer (INL). RINX is closely related to Chx10, which is also exclusively 
expressed in the INL of the adult retina and is critical for retinal development.
The RINX gene is expressed in two classes of mRNA. One class encodes proteins
that lack either part of or all of the HD, but retain the transcriptional
activation domain. The RINX gene maps to chromosome 20p11.2 to which no retinal
disease has been assigned. In conclusion, the LCR contains two adjacent motifs
that are targets for binding of HD proteins that may specify the development and 
differentiation of cone photoreceptors and a subset of INL bipolar cells.
Mutations in the related human CHX10 gene cause microphthalmia in a subset of
families, and, therefore, the RINX gene is a candidate for this phenotype in
another subset of patients. Since the RINX gene is likely an ortholog of the
goldfish Vsx1 gene, it has been named VSX1 by the Human Gene Nomenclature
Committee.

Ubiquitination and degradation of the zebrafish paired-like homeobox protein
VSX-1.

Developmental Biology, State University of New York, Stony Brook, New York, USA.

Vsx-1 is a paired-like : CVC homeobox protein dynamically expressed during
zebrafish development. Previous results indicate that Vsx-1 influences bipolar
cell differentiation and maintenance of these cells in the adult retina. To
understand the developmental regulation of this transcription factor, we
investigated ubiquitination as a possible posttranslational mechanism. In vitro, 
Vsx-1 was conjugated with multiple ubiquitin moieties. Proteasome inhibitors and 
added ubiquitin increased the accumulation of Vsx-1-ubiquitin(n) complexes and
stabilized unmodified Vsx-1. Also, in transiently transfected COS-7 cells, Vsx-1 
is ubiquitinated, and pulse-chase experiments show that Vsx-1 proteolysis occurs.
Vsx-1 proteins with C-terminal deletions retained the capacity for initial
modification by ubiquitin but lost the capacity for efficient chain elongation.
These results show that Vsx-1 is a substrate of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway 
and suggest that C-terminal sequences of Vsx-1 are critical for ubiquitin chain
elongation. In addition, our findings suggest that ubiquitin-dependent
proteolysis regulates Vsx-1 during zebrafish retinal development.

Homeodomain transcription factors control cell fates during the development of
all animals. The paired-like subfamily of homeodomain proteins has been
particularly implicated in ocular development in different species. In this paper
we report the cDNA sequence, genomic structure, localization, and expression data
of a novel paired-like homeobox-containing gene, VSX1, isolated from a human
embryonic craniofacial cDNA library using the degenerate-PCR approach. The
composed VSX1 cDNA sequence of 1433 bp was predicted to encode a protein of 365
amino acid residues. Maximal homology at the protein level was identified with
the paired-like homeoproteins of the CVC-domain family: 92-97% identity was seen 
in the homeodomain region with 55% overall identity to zebrafish and goldfish
Vsx1 and 35% overall identity to goldfish Vsx2 and murine Chx10. The gene was
found to consist of five exons that are distributed over 6.2 kb of genomic
sequence. VSX1 was localized to the 20p11-q11 region, which is homologous with
the distal part of mouse chromosome 2. Expression of VSX1 was detected in
embryonic craniofacial and adult ocular tissues. Several ocular phenotypes have
been mapped to the VSX1 region in both human and mouse genomes, and its candidacy
for these disorders is discussed.

Cloning of zebrafish vsx1: expression of a paired-like homeobox gene during CNS
development.

vsx1 is a homeobox gene encoding a paired-type homeodomain and a CVC domain that 
was originally cloned from an adult goldfish retinal library. We previously
reported the spatiotemporal expression pattern of vsx1 in the adult and
developing retina of zebrafish and goldfish, and we suggested that vsx1 plays a
role in determining the cell fate and maintenance of retinal interneurons. Other 
related genes encoding a CVC domain, such as vsx2 (alx) and chx10, are expressed 
both within and outside the retina during development. In this study, we report
the cloning of zebrafish vsx1 and its developmental expression in both retinal
and nonretinal regions of the CNS in zebrafish embryos. vsx1 expression was
detected in a subset of hindbrain and spinal cord neurons before it was expressed
in the retina. At about the same time that retinal expression began, the level of
vsx1 was decreased in the spinal cord. The expression of vsx1 was progressively
restricted, and eventually it was detected only in the inner nuclear layer (INL) 
of the developing retina. The combined expression patterns of teleost vsx1 and
vsx2 (alx) during early zebrafish development encompasses the expression pattern 
observed for murine Chx10, and indicates a partitioning of function for CVC genes
in lower vertebrates.

Vsx-1 and Vsx-2: differential expression of two paired-like homeobox genes during
zebrafish and goldfish retinogenesis.

Vsx-1 and Vsx-2 are two homeobox genes that were cloned originally from an adult 
goldfish retinal library. They are members of the paired-like:CVC gene family,
which is characterized by the presence of a paired homeodomain and an additional 
conserved region, termed the CVC domain. To analyze the possible roles for Vsx-1 
and Vsx-2 in eye development, we used in situ hybridization to examine their
expression patterns in zebrafish and goldfish embryos. Vsx-2 is initially
expressed by proliferating neuroepithelial cells of the presumptive neural
retina, then it is down-regulated as differentiation begins, and it is finally
reexpressed at later stages of differentiation in a subset of cells, presumed to 
be bipolar cells, in the inner nuclear layer. In contrast, Vsx-1 is expressed
only weakly in undifferentiated, presumptive neural retina and is then
up-regulated selectively in presumptive bipolar cells at early stages of
differentiation (when Vsx-2 is turned off), before decreasing to an intermediate 
level, which is maintained in the differentiated (adult) retina. The restricted
expression patterns of Vsx-2 correspond to the observed phenotypes in mice with
the ocular retardation mutation (orJ), further supporting the notion that Vsx-2
and Chx10 are homologues. The sequential complimentary and then corresponding
expression patterns of Vsx-1 and Vsx-2 suggest that these similar transcription
factors may be recruited for partially overlapping, but distinct, functions
during the development of the retina.

Vsx-1 and Vsx-2: two Chx10-like homeobox genes expressed in overlapping domains
in the adult goldfish retina.

The genetic linkages of the murine ocular retardation mutation with the Chx10
gene and the murine small eye mutation with the Pax-6 gene has demonstrated the
importance of Paired class homeobox genes in the development of the mammalian
retina. Previously, we identified a Paired-class homeobox gene, Vsx-1, whose
expression in the adult goldfish retina is restricted to the inner nuclear layer 
(INL) and to postmitotic, differentiating progenitor cells in the growth zone at 
the retinal peripheral margin, where neurogenesis continues throughout life.
Here, we report the molecular cloning and expression pattern of a new Paired
class homeobox gene, Vsx-2, in the adult goldfish retina. Like Vsx-1, Vsx-2
expression is highly restricted to the retina in the adult goldfish and overlaps 
with Vsx-1 expression in the mature INL. At the peripheral margin, Vsx-2 is
expressed in mitotically active neuronal progenitors and is downregulated as
these cells become postmitotic and begin to differentiate. Comparison of the
amino acid sequences of Vsx-2, Vsx-1, Chx10, and C. elegans ceh-10 reveal a
conserved homeodomain and a unique domain termed the CVC domain. The similarities
of the Vsx-2, Vsx-1, and Chx10 expression patterns suggest that genes containing 
the CVC domain have conserved functions during retinal development in
vertebrates.
