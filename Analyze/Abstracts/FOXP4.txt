In the past twenty-five years, over 700 case-control association studies on the
risk of prostate cancer have been published worldwide, but their results were
largely inconsistent. To facilitate following and explaining these findings, we
performed a systematic meta-analysis using allelic contrasts for gene-specific
SNVs from at least three independent population-based case-control studies, which
were published in the field of prostate cancer between August 1, 1990 and August 
1, 2015. Across 66 meta-analyses, a total of 20 genetic variants involving
584,100 subjects in 19 different genes (KLK3, IGFBP3, ESR1, SOD2, CAT, CYP1B1,
VDR, RFX6, HNF1B, SRD5A2, FGFR4, LEP, HOXB13, FAS, FOXP4, SLC22A3, LMTK2, EHBP1
and MSMB) exhibited significant association with prostate cancer. The average
summary OR was 1.33 (ranging from: 1.016-3.788) for risk alleles and 0.838
(ranging from: 0.757-0.896) for protective alleles. Of these positive variants,
FOXP4 rs1983891, LMTK2 rs6465657 and RFX6 rs339331 had not been previously
meta-analyzed. Further analyses with sufficient power design and investigations
of the potential biological roles of these genetic variants in prostate cancer
should be conducted.

with small ubiquitin-like modifiers.

Mutations affecting the transcription factor FOXP2 cause a rare form of severe
speech and language disorder. Although it is clear that sufficient FOXP2
expression is crucial for normal brain development, little is known about how
this transcription factor is regulated. To investigate post-translational
mechanisms for FOXP2 regulation, we searched for protein interaction partners of 
FOXP2, and identified members of the PIAS family as novel FOXP2 interactors. PIAS
proteins mediate post-translational modification of a range of target proteins
with small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs). We found that FOXP2 can be modified 
with all three human SUMO proteins and that PIAS1 promotes this process. An
aetiological FOXP2 mutation found in a family with speech and language disorder
markedly reduced FOXP2 SUMOylation. We demonstrate that FOXP2 is SUMOylated at a 
single major site, which is conserved in all FOXP2 vertebrate orthologues and in 
the paralogues FOXP1 and FOXP4. Abolishing this site did not lead to detectable
changes in FOXP2 subcellular localization, stability, dimerization or
transcriptional repression in cellular assays, but the conservation of this site 
suggests a potential role for SUMOylation in regulating FOXP2 activity in vivo.

Association of FOXP4 Gene with Prostate Cancer and the Cumulative Effects of
rs4714476 and 8q24 in Chinese Men.

F, Sun L, Zhu X, Zhao C, Zhu L, Tang L, Zheng C, Yang Z.

BACKGROUND: The tumor suppressor forkhead box P4 (FOXP4) plays important roles in
oncogenesis, and the FOXP4 variant rs1983891 is associated with prostate cancer
(PCa) in several studies. However, association studies conducted in Northern and 
Southern Chinese have provided conflicting results. Therefore, here we performed 
fine mapping of FOXP4 to identify the association with PCa and the potential
application in Chinese men.
METHODS: We examined 11 variants spaced approximately 55 kb apart spanning FOXP4 
using high-resolution melting-curve analysis and sequencing methods in 286 PCa
patients and 630 controls, and the association between these variants and PCa
risk was evaluated. Additionally, we evaluated the cumulative effect of rs4714476
and 2 variants in 8q24 (rs16901966, rs10090154) confirmed in our previous study.
RESULTS: Of 11 SNPs, only rs4714476-C at the 5' near gene of FOXP4 was associated
with increased age-adjusted PCa risk (p = 0.012, OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.06 - 1.63)
and aggressive PCa (p = 0.026). The CG haplotype covering rs4714476-C
demonstrated significant differences between PCa cases and controls (p = 0.009). 
The cumulative effect analysis showed men who carried any combination of 1, 2, or
3 risk genotypes had a gradually increased PCa risk (age-adjusted OR is from
1.244 to 3.312).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that rs4714476 at the 5' near gene of FOXP4
potentially contributes to the susceptibility of PCa in Chinese men. The
cumulative effect of rs4714476 at FOXP4 and 8q24 could increase PCa risk.

PURPOSE: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignancies in males,
and multiple genetic studies have confirmed association with susceptibility to
PCa. However, the risk conferred in men living in China is unkown. We selected 6 
previously identified variants as candidates to define their association with PCa
in Chinese men.
METHODS: We genotyped 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1465618,
rs1983891, rs339331, rs16901966, rs1447295 and rs10090154) using high resolution 
melting (HRM) analysis and assessed their association with PCa risk in a
case-control study of 481 patients and 480 controls in a Chinese population. In
addition, the individual and cumulative contribution for the risk of PCa and
clinical covariates were analysed.
RESULTS: We found that 5 of the 6 genetic variants were associated with PCa risk.
The T allele of rs339331 and the G allele of rs16901966 showed a significant
association with PCa susceptibility: OR (95%CI)= 0.78 (0.64-0.94), p<0.009 and OR
(95%CI)= 0.66 (0.54-0.81), p<0.0001, as well as A allele of rs1447295 (OR
[95%CI]=1.46 (1.17-1.84), p<0.001) and T allele of rs10090154 (OR [95%CI]= 0.58
(0.46-0.74), p<0.0001). rs339331(T) was associated with a 0.71-fold and 1.42-fold
increase of PCa risk by dominant model (p=0.007) and recessive model (p=0.007).
rs16901966 (G) was associated with a 0.51-fold and 1.98-fold increase of PCa risk
by dominant model (p=0.006) and recessive model (p=0.0058). rs10090154 (T) was
associated with a 1.89-fold and 0.53-fold increase of PCa risk by dominant model 
(p=0.000006) and recessive model (p=0.000006). And, rs1983891(C) was associated
with a 0.77-fold increase of PCa risk by recessive model (p=0.045). rs1447295 was
associated with a 1.57-fold increase of PCa risk by dominant model (p=0.008).
rs1465618 showed no significant association with PCa. The cumulative effects test
of risk alleles (rs rs1983891, rs339331, rs16901966, rs1447295 and rs10090154)
showed an increasing risk to PCa in a frequency-dependent manner (ptrend=0.001), 
and men with more than 3 risk alleles had the most significant susceptibility to 
PCa (OR=1.99, p=0.001), compared with those who had one risk allele (OR=1.17,
p=0.486).
CONCLUSION: Our results provide further support for association of the THADA,
FOXP4, GPRC6A/RFX6 and 8q24 genes with Pca in Asian populations. Further work is 
still required to determine the functional variations and finally clarify the
underlying biological mechanisms.

Epigenetic changes in articular chondrocytes are associated with osteoarthritis
(OA) disease progression. Numerous studies have identified differentially
methylated cytosines in OA tissues; however, the consequences of altered CpG
methylation at single nucleotides on gene expression and phenotypes are difficult
to predict. With the objective of detecting novel genes relevant to OA, we
conducted a genome-wide assessment of differentially methylated sites (DMSs) and 
differentially methylated regions (DMRs). DNA was extracted from visually damaged
and normal appearing, non-damaged human knee articular cartilage from the same
joint and then subjected to reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. DMRs
were identified using a genome-wide systematic bioinformatics approach. A
sliding-window of 500bp was used for screening the genome for regions with
clusters of DMSs. Gene expression levels were assessed and cell culture
demethylation experiments were performed to further examine top candidate genes
associated with damaged articular cartilage. More than 1000 DMRs were detected in
damaged osteoarthritic cartilage. Nineteen of these contained five or more DMSs
and were located in gene promoters or first introns and exons. Gene expression
assessment revealed that hypermethylated DMRs in damaged samples were more
consistently associated with gene repression than hypomethylated DMRs were with
gene activation. Accordingly, a demethylation agent induced expression of most
hypermethylated genes in chondrocytes. Our study revealed the utility of a
systematic DMR search as an alternative to focusing on single nucleotide data. In
particular, this approach uncovered promising candidates for functional studies
such as the hypermethylated protein-coding genes FOXP4 and SHROOM1, which appear 
to be linked to OA pathology in humans and warrant further investigation.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Several forkhead box (FOX) transcription factor family members
have important roles in controlling pancreatic cell fates and maintaining beta
cell mass and function, including FOXA1, FOXA2 and FOXM1. In this study we have
examined the importance of FOXP1, FOXP2 and FOXP4 of the FOXP subfamily in islet 
cell development and function.
METHODS: Mice harbouring floxed alleles for Foxp1, Foxp2 and Foxp4 were crossed
with pan-endocrine Pax6-Cre transgenic mice to generate single and compound Foxp 
mutant mice. Mice were monitored for changes in glucose tolerance by IPGTT, serum
insulin and glucagon levels by radioimmunoassay, and endocrine cell development
and proliferation by immunohistochemistry. Gene expression and glucose-stimulated
hormone secretion experiments were performed with isolated islets.
RESULTS: Only the triple-compound Foxp1/2/4 conditional knockout (cKO) mutant had
an overt islet phenotype, manifested physiologically by hypoglycaemia and
hypoglucagonaemia. This resulted from the reduction in glucagon-secreting alpha
cell mass and function. The proliferation of alpha cells was profoundly reduced
in Foxp1/2/4 cKO islets through the effects on mediators of replication (i.e.
decreased Ccna2, Ccnb1 and Ccnd2 activators, and increased Cdkn1a inhibitor).
Adult islet Foxp1/2/4 cKO beta cells secrete insulin normally while the remaining
alpha cells have impaired glucagon secretion.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Collectively, these findings reveal an important role
for the FOXP1, 2, and 4 proteins in governing postnatal alpha cell expansion and 
function.

Family of forkhead box transcription factors, including forkhead box P4 (FOXP4), 
plays an important role in oncogenesis. The current study is to evaluate the role
of FOXP4 in regulating human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Quantitative
RT-PCR and Western blot were performed to evaluate the gene and protein
expressions of FOXP4 in six NSCLC cell lines and 55 NSCLC patients. Lentivirus of
small hairpin RNA (FOXP4-shRNA) was used to downregulate FOXP4 in NSCLC cell
lines A549 and H1703 cells. Its effect on NSCLC growth, invasion, and cell cycle 
were evaluated by cell proliferation assay, migration assay, and cell cycle
assay, respectively. Dual luciferase assay and Western blot were used to examine 
whether microRNA-138 (miR-138) was an upstream regulator of FOXP4. The dependence
of FOXP4 on miR-138 associated signaling pathway was evaluated by ectopically
overexpressing enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a known miR-138 target in
NSCLC. FOXP4 was highly expressed in both NSCLC cell lines and NSCLC patients.
FOXP4 downregulation by FOXP4-shRNA markedly reduced cancer cell growth and
invasion, as well as induced cell cycle arrest in A549 and H1703 cells. MiR-138
was confirmed to be an upstream regulator of FOXP4 and directly regulated FOXP4
expression in A549 and H1703 cells. FOXP4 downregulation-mediated inhibition on
cancer cell growth and invasion was independent on overexpressing EZH2, another
direct target of miR-138 in NSCLC. Our data demonstrated that FOXP4 was a
critical regulator in NSCLC and independently associated with miR-138 regulation.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNAs, which have demonstrated
to important gene regulators, and have critical roles in diverse biological
processes including cancer cell proliferation. Previous studies suggested
microRNA-338-3p (miR-338-3p) was down-regulated and play tumor suppressor roles
in gastric cancer, colorectal carcinoma and lung cancer. However, the role of
miR-338-3p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unclear. In this study, we 
analyzed the expression of miR-338-3p in HCC tissues and HCC cell lines. We find 
that miR-338-3p was downregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. Then functional 
studies demonstrate ectopic miR-338-3p expression significantly suppressed the in
vitro proliferation and colony formation of HCC cells and cause to cell cycle
arrest. Using bio-informatic method and report assay we identified a novel
miR-338-3p target, FOXP4 in HCC cells. Furthermore, knockdown of FOXP4 have the
similar effects in HCC corrected with miR-338-3p. These findings suggest that
miR-338-3p regulates survival of HCC cells partially through the downregulation
of FOXP4. Therefore, targeting with the miR-338-3p/FOXP4 axis might serve as a
novel therapeutic application to treat HCC patients.

Heterozygous disruptions of the Forkhead transcription factor FoxP2 impair
acquisition of speech and language. Experimental downregulation in brain region
Area X of the avian ortholog FoxP2 disrupts song learning in juvenile male zebra 
finches. In vitro, transcriptional activity of FoxP2 requires dimerization with
itself or with paralogs FoxP1 and FoxP4. Whether this is the case in vivo is
unknown. To provide the means for future functional studies we cloned FoxP4 from 
zebra finches and compared regional and cellular coexpression of FoxP1, FoxP2,
and FoxP4 mRNA and protein in brains of juvenile and adult male zebra finches. In
the telencephalic song nuclei HVC, RA, and Area X, the three investigated FoxPs
were either expressed alone or occurred in specific combinations with each other,
as shown by double in situ hybridization and triple immunohistochemistry. FoxP1
and FoxP4 but not FoxP2 were expressed in RA and in the HVCRA and HVCX projection
neurons. In Area X and the surrounding striatum the density of neurons expressing
all three FoxPs together or FoxP1 and FoxP4 together was significantly higher
than the density of neurons expressing other combinations. Interestingly, the
proportions of Area X neurons expressing particular combinations of FoxPs
remained constant at all ages. In addition, FoxP-expressing neurons in adult Area
X express dopamine receptors 1A, 1B, and 2. Together, these data provide the
first evidence that Area X neurons can coexpress all avian FoxP subfamily
members, thus allowing for a variety of regulatory possibilities via
heterodimerization that could impact song behavior in zebra finches.

Osteoblast induction and differentiation in developing long bones is dynamically 
controlled by the opposing action of transcriptional activators and repressors.
In contrast to the long list of activators that have been discovered over past
decades, the network of repressors is not well-defined. Here we identify the
expression of Foxp1/2/4 proteins, comprised of Forkhead-box (Fox) transcription
factors of the Foxp subfamily, in both perichondrial skeletal progenitors and
proliferating chondrocytes during endochondral ossification. Mice carrying
loss-of-function and gain-of-function Foxp mutations had gross defects in
appendicular skeleton formation. At the cellular level, over-expression of
Foxp1/2/4 in chondroctyes abrogated osteoblast formation and chondrocyte
hypertrophy. Conversely, single or compound deficiency of Foxp1/2/4 in skeletal
progenitors or chondrocytes resulted in premature osteoblast differentiation in
the perichondrium, coupled with impaired proliferation, survival, and hypertrophy
of chondrocytes in the growth plate. Foxp1/2/4 and Runx2 proteins interacted in
vitro and in vivo, and Foxp1/2/4 repressed Runx2 transactivation function in
heterologous cells. This study establishes Foxp1/2/4 proteins as coordinators of 
osteogenesis and chondrocyte hypertrophy in developing long bones and suggests
that a novel transcriptional repressor network involving Foxp1/2/4 may regulate
Runx2 during endochondral ossification.

Transcriptional regulation by FOXP1, FOXP2, and FOXP4 dimerization.

(1)School of Kinesiology and Health Science, York University, Toronto, Ontario,
Canada.

FOXP1, FOXP2, and FOXP4 are three members of the FOXP gene subfamily of
transcription factors involved in the development of the central nervous system. 
Previous studies have shown that the transcriptional activity of FOXP1/2/4 is
regulated by homo- and heterodimerization. However, their transcriptional gene
targets in the developing brain are still largely unknown. FOXP2 regulates the
expression of many genes important in embryonic development, including WNT and
Notch signaling pathways. In this study, we investigate whether dimerization of
FOXP1/2/4 leads to differential expression of ten known FOXP2 target genes (CER1,
SFRP4, WISP2, PRICKLE1, NCOR2, SNW1, NEUROD2, PAX3, EFNB3, and SLIT1). FOXP1/2/4 
open-reading frames were stably transfected into HEK293 cells, and the expression
level of these FOXP2 target genes was quantified using real-time polymerase chain
reaction. Our results revealed that the specific combination of FOXP1/2/4 dimers 
regulates transcription of various FOXP2 target genes involved in early neuronal 
development.

Acute inflammation is traditionally characterized by polymorphonuclear leukocytes
(PMN) influx followed by phagocytosing macrophage (Mfs) that clear injurious
stimuli leading to resolution and tissue homeostasis. However, using the
peritoneal cavity, we found that although innate immune-mediated responses to
low-dose zymosan or bacteria resolve within days, these stimuli, but not
hyperinflammatory stimuli, trigger a previously overlooked second wave of
leukocyte influx into tissues that persists for weeks. These cells comprise
distinct populations of tissue-resident Mfs (resMfs), Ly6c(hi) monocyte-derived
Mfs (moMfs), monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs), and myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSCs). Postresolution mononuclear phagocytes were observed
alongside lymph node expansion and increased numbers of blood and peritoneal
memory T and B lymphocytes. The resMfs and moMfs triggered FoxP3 expression
within CD4 cells, whereas moDCs drive T-cell proliferation. The resMfs
preferentially clear apoptotic PMNs and migrate to lymph nodes to bring about
their contraction in an inducible nitric oxide synthase-dependent manner.
Finally, moMfs remain in tissues for months postresolution, alongside altered
numbers of T cells collectively dictating the magnitude of subsequent acute
inflammatory reactions. These data challenge the prevailing idea that resolution 
leads back to homeostasis and asserts that resolution acts as a bridge between
innate and adaptive immunity, as well as tissue reprogramming.

A screen for hydroxymethylcytosine and formylcytosine binding proteins suggests
functions in transcription and chromatin regulation.

Balasubramanian S, Reik W.

BACKGROUND: DNA methylation (5mC) plays important roles in epigenetic regulation 
of genome function. Recently, TET hydroxylases have been found to oxidise 5mC to 
hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), formylcytosine (5fC) and carboxylcytosine (5caC) in
DNA. These derivatives have a role in demethylation of DNA but in addition may
have epigenetic signaling functions in their own right. A recent study identified
proteins which showed preferential binding to 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and its
oxidised forms, where readers for 5mC and 5hmC showed little overlap, and
proteins bound to further oxidation forms were enriched for repair proteins and
transcription regulators. We extend this study by using promoter sequences as
baits and compare protein binding patterns to unmodified or modified cytosine
using DNA from mouse embryonic stem cell extracts.
RESULTS: We compared protein enrichments from two DNA probes with different CpG
composition and show that, whereas some of the enriched proteins show specificity
to cytosine modifications, others are selective for both modification and target 
sequences. Only a few proteins were identified with a preference for 5hmC (such
as RPL26, PRP8 and the DNA mismatch repair protein MHS6), but proteins with a
strong preference for 5fC were more numerous, including transcriptional
regulators (FOXK1, FOXK2, FOXP1, FOXP4 and FOXI3), DNA repair factors (TDG and
MPG) and chromatin regulators (EHMT1, L3MBTL2 and all components of the NuRD
complex).
CONCLUSIONS: Our screen has identified novel proteins that bind to 5fC in genomic
sequences with different CpG composition and suggests they regulate transcription
and chromatin, hence opening up functional investigations of 5fC readers.

BACKGROUND: KLK3 gene products, like human prostate-specific antigen (PSA), are
important biomarkers in the clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa). G
protein-coupled receptor RFX6, C2orf43 and FOXP4 signaling plays important roles 
in the development of PCa. However, associations of these genes with PCa in
northern Chinese men remain to be detailed. This study aimed to investigate their
impact on occurrence and level of malignancy.
METHODS: All subjects were from Beijing and Tianjin, including 266 cases with
prostate cancer and 288 normal individuals as controls. We evaluated associations
between clinical covariates (age at diagnosis, prostate specific antigen, Gleason
score, tumor stage and aggressive) and 6 candidate PCa risk loci, genotyped by
PCR- high resolution melting curve and sequencing methods.
RESULTS: Case-control analysis of allelic frequency of PCa associated with PCa
showed that one of the 6 candidate risk loci, rs339331 in the RFX6 gene, was
associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 0.73, 95%
confidence interval (CI) =0.57-0.94, P = 0.013) in northern Chinese men. In
addition, subjects with CX (CC+TC) genotypes had a decreased risk for prostrate
cancer compared to those carrying the TT homozygote (OR =0.64, 95% CI = 0.45-
0.90, P = 0.008). The TT genotype of 13q22 (rs9600079, T) was associated with
tumor stage (P=0.044, OR=2.34, 95% CI=0.94-5.87). Other SNPs were not
significantly associated with clinical covariates in prostate cancer (P > 0.05). 
CONCLUSIONS. rs339331 in the RFX6 gene may be associated with prostate cancer as 
a susceptibility locus in northern Chinese men.

The role of the FOXP family of transcription factors in ASD.

Bowers JM(1), Konopka G.

Author information:

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease with complex
genetics; however, the genes that are responsible for this disease still remain
mostly unknown. Here, we focus on the FOXP family of transcription factors as
there is emerging evidence strongly linking these genes to ASD and other genes
implicated in ASD. The FOXP family of genes includes three genes expressed in the
central nervous system: FOXP1, FOPX2, and FOXP4. This unique group of
transcription factors has known functions in brain development as well as the
evolution of language. We will also discuss the other genes including
transcriptional targets of FOXP genes that have been found to be associated with 
language and may be important in the pathophysiology of ASD. Finally, we will
review the emerging animal models currently being used to study the function of
the FOXP genes within the context of ASD symptomology. The combination of gene
expression and animal behavior is critical for elucidating how genes such as the 
FOXP family members are key players within the framework of the developing brain.

responses.

Transcription factors regulate T cell fates at every stage of development and
differentiation. Members of the Foxp family of forkhead transcription factors are
essential for normal T lineage development; Foxp3 is required for T regulatory
cell generation and function, and Foxp1 is necessary for generation and
maintenance of naïve T cells. Foxp4, an additional member of the Foxp family, is 
highly homologous to Foxp1 and has been shown to dimerize with other Foxp
proteins. We report the initial characterization of Foxp4 in T lymphocytes. Foxp4
is expressed in both thymocytes and peripheral CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. We used
a CD4Cre mediated approach to evaluate the cell autonomous role for Foxp4 in
murine T lymphocytes. T cell development, peripheral cellularity and cell surface
phenotype are normal in the absence of Foxp4. Furthermore, Foxp3(+) T regulatory 
cells develop normally in Foxp4 deficient animals and naïve Foxp4 deficient CD4 T
cells can differentiate to inducible T regulatory cells in vitro. In wild-type T 
cells, expression of Foxp4 increases following activation, but deletion of Foxp4 
does not affect T cell proliferative responses or in vitro effector T cell
differentiation. In vivo, despite effective control of Toxoplasma gondii and
acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections, effector cytokine production
during antigen specific recall responses are reduced in the absence of Foxp4. We 
conclude that Foxp4 is dispensable for T cell development, but necessary for
normal T cell cytokine recall responses to antigen following pathogenic
infection.

Sex-dependent changes in cerebellar thyroid hormone-dependent gene expression
following perinatal exposure to thimerosal in rats.

Mammalian brain development is regulated by the action of thyroid hormone (TH) on
target genes. We have previously shown that the perinatal exposure to thimerosal 
(TM, metabolized to ethylmercury) exerts neurotoxic effects on the developing
cerebellum and is associated with a decrease in cerebellar D2 activity, which
could result in local brain T3 deficiency. We have also begun to examine TM
effect on gene expression. The objective of this study was to expand on our
initial observation of altered cerebellar gene expression following perinatal TM 
exposure and to examine additional genes that include both TH-dependent as well
as other genes critical for cerebellar development in male and female neonates
exposed perinatally (G10-G15 and P5 to P10) to TM. We report here for the first
time that expression of suppressor-of-white-apricot-1 (SWAP-1), a gene negatively
regulated by T3, was increased in TM-exposed males (61.1% increase), but not in
females; (p<0.05). Positively regulated T3-target genes, Purkinje cell protein 2 
(Pcp2; p=0.07) and Forkhead box protein P4 (FoxP4; p=0.08), showed a trend
towards decreased expression in TM-exposed males. The expression of deiodinase 2 
(DIO2) showed a trend towards an increase in TM-exposed females, while deiodinase
3 (DIO3), transthyretin (TTR), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and
reelin (RELN) was not significantly altered in either sex. Since regulation of
gene splicing is vital to neuronal proliferation and differentiation, altered
expression of SWAP-1 may exert wide ranging effects on multiple genes involved in
the regulation of cerebellar development. We have previously identified
activation of another TH-dependent gene, outer dense fiber of sperm tails 4, in
the TM exposed male pups. Together, these results also show sex-dependent
differences between the toxic impacts of TM in males and females. Interestingly, 
the genes that were activated by TM are negatively regulated by TH, supporting
our hypothesis of local brain hypothyroidism being induced by TM and suggesting a
novel mechanism of action TM in the developing brain.

Foxp1/4 control epithelial cell fate during lung development and regeneration
through regulation of anterior gradient 2.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104,
USA.

The molecular pathways regulating cell lineage determination and regeneration in 
epithelial tissues are poorly understood. The secretory epithelium of the lung is
required for production of mucus to help protect the lung against environmental
insults, including pathogens and pollution, that can lead to debilitating
diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We show that
the transcription factors Foxp1 and Foxp4 act cooperatively to regulate lung
secretory epithelial cell fate and regeneration by directly restricting the
goblet cell lineage program. Loss of Foxp1/4 in the developing lung and in
postnatal secretory epithelium leads to ectopic activation of the goblet cell
fate program, in part, through de-repression of the protein disulfide isomerase
anterior gradient 2 (Agr2). Forced expression of Agr2 is sufficient to promote
the goblet cell fate in the developing airway epithelium. Finally, in a model of 
lung secretory cell injury and regeneration, we show that loss of Foxp1/4 leads
to catastrophic loss of airway epithelial regeneration due to default
differentiation of secretory cells into the goblet cell lineage. These data
demonstrate the importance of Foxp1/4 in restricting cell fate choices during
development and regeneration, thereby providing the proper balance of functional 
epithelial lineages in the lung.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer represents the leading cause of male death across the
world. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified five novel
susceptibility loci for prostate cancer in the Japanese population. This study is
to replicate and fine map the potential association of these five loci with
prostate cancer in the Chinese Han population.
METHODS: In Phase I of the study, we tested the five single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) which showed the strongest association evidence in the
original GWAS in Japanese. The study sample consists of 1,169 Chinese Hans,
comprising 483 patients and 686 healthy controls. Then in phase II, flanking SNPs
of the successfully replicated SNPs in Phase I were genotyped and tested for
association with prostate cancer to fine map those significant association
signals.
RESULTS: We successfully replicated the association of rs13385191 (located in the
C2orf43 gene, P<U+200A>=<U+200A>8.60×10(-5)), rs12653946 (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>1.33×10(-6)), rs1983891 (FOXP4,
P<U+200A>=<U+200A>6.22×10(-5)), and rs339331 (GPRC6A/RFX6, P<U+200A>=<U+200A>1.42×10(-5)) with prostate
cancer. The most significant odds ratio (OR) was recorded as 1.41 (95% confidence
interval 1.18-1.68) for rs12653946. Rs9600079 did not show significant
association (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>8.07×10(-2)) with prostate cancer in this study. The Phase II
study refined these association signals, and identified several SNPs showing more
significant association with prostate cancer than the very SNPs tested in Phase
I.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide further support for association of the C2orf43, 
FOXP4, GPRC6A and RFX6 genes with prostate cancer in Eastern Asian populations.
This study also characterized the novel loci reported in the original GWAS with
more details. Further work is still required to determine the functional
variations and finally clarify the underlying biological mechanisms.

    Neuron. 2012 Apr 26;74(2):209-11.

Neuroepithelial attachments at adherens junctions are essential for the
self-renewal of neural stem and progenitor cells and the polarized organization
of the developing central nervous system. The balance between stem cell
maintenance and differentiation depends on the precise assembly and disassembly
of these adhesive contacts, but the gene regulatory mechanisms orchestrating this
process are not known. Here, we demonstrate that two Forkhead transcription
factors, Foxp2 and Foxp4, are progressively expressed upon neural differentiation
in the spinal cord. Elevated expression of either Foxp represses the expression
of a key component of adherens junctions, N-cadherin, and promotes the detachment
of differentiating neurons from the neuroepithelium. Conversely, inactivation of 
Foxp2 and Foxp4 function in both chick and mouse results in a spectrum of neural 
tube defects associated with neuroepithelial disorganization and enhanced
progenitor maintenance. Together, these data reveal a Foxp-based transcriptional 
mechanism that regulates the integrity and cytoarchitecture of neuroepithelial
progenitors.

Neratinib (HKI-272) is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the ErbB
receptor family currently in Phase III clinical trials. Despite its efficacy, the
mechanism of potential cellular resistance to neratinib and genes involved with
it remains unknown. We have used a pool-based lentiviral genome-wide functional
RNAi screen combined with a lethal dose of neratinib to discover chemoresistant
interactions with neratinib. Our screen has identified a collection of genes
whose inhibition by RNAi led to neratinib resistance including genes involved in 
oncogenesis (e.g. RAB33A, RAB6A and BCL2L14), transcription factors (e.g. FOXP4, 
TFEC, ZNF), cellular ion transport (e.g. CLIC3, TRAPPC2P1, P2RX2), protein
ubiquitination (e.g. UBL5), cell cycle (e.g. CCNF), and genes known to interact
with breast cancer-associated genes (e.g. CCNF, FOXP4, TFEC, several ZNF factors,
GNA13, IGFBP1, PMEPA1, SOX5, RAB33A, RAB6A, FXR1, DDO, TFEC, OLFM2). The
identification of novel mediators of cellular resistance to neratinib could lead 
to the identification of new or neoadjuvant drug targets. Their use as patient or
treatment selection biomarkers could make the application of anti-ErbB
therapeutics more clinically effective.

Investigation of the molecular response to folate metabolism inhibition.

We investigated the molecular response to folate metabolism inhibition by
exposing human lymphoblast cell lines to the methionine adenosyltransferase
inhibitor cycloleucine. We carried out microarray analysis on replicate control
and exposed cells by examining 47,000 transcripts on the Affymetrix HG U133 plus 
2.0 arrays. We identified 13 genes that we considered reliable responders to
cycloleucine treatment: chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3), prostaglandin-endoperoxide 
synthase 2, growth arrest-specific 7, reduced folate carrier, klotho beta, early 
growth response 1, diaphanous homolog 3, prostaglandin D2 synthase (PGDS),
butyrophilin-like 9, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 11,
chromosome 21 orf15, G-protein-coupled receptor 98 (GPR98) and
cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS). We further demonstrated that four of these
genes, CXCR3, PGDS, GPR98 and CBS, consistently responded to cycloleucine
treatment in additional experiments over a range of concentrations. We carried
out gene-specific DNA methylation analysis on five genes, including CBS, and
found no evidence that DNA methylation changes were mediating the gene expression
changes observed. Pathway analysis of the microarray data identified four
pathways of relevance for response to cycloleucine; the immune response NF-AT
signaling pathway was the most statistically significant. Comparison with other
gene expression studies focusing on folate deficiency revealed that gene products
related to immune cells or the immune response is a common theme. This indicates 
that apart from their role in the immune response, it is likely that these gene
products may also have a role to play in the cellular response to folate status.

An expression profile analysis of ES cell-derived definitive endodermal cells and
Pdx1-expressing cells.

Genetics, Kumamoto University, Honjo 2-2-1, Kumamoto, Japan.

BACKGROUND: We developed an efficient in vitro method to differentiate mouse ES
cells into the definitive endoderm (DE) and then Pdx1-expressing pancreatic
lineages using mesodermal-derived supporting cells, M15. Using this method,
resulting ES cell-derived DE and Pdx1-expressing cells were isolated by cell
sorting, and their gene expression profiles were investigated with DNA
microarray. Genes that were specifically expressed in DE and/or in
Pdx1-expressing cells were extracted and their expression patterns in normal
embryonic development were studied.
RESULTS: Genes whose expression increased in DE and Pdx1 positive cells compared 
to the undifferentiated ES cells were chosen and in situ hybridizations were
performed. Out of 54 genes examined, 27 were expressed in the DE of E8.5 mouse
embryos and 15 genes were expressed in distinct domains in the pancreatic buds of
E14.5 embryos. Among those genes expressed were Foxq1, CpM, Foxp4, Pcdh1, and
Zmiz1, which were previously reported in other endodermal tissues. Genes, such as
Parm1, Tmem184a, Hipk2 and Sox4 were reported to be expressed during early
pancreatic development. Nptx2, C2cd4b, Tcf7l2 and Kiss1r were reported to be
associated with beta cell or pancreatic functions in the adult. Akr1c19, Aebp2,
Pbxip1 and Creb3l1, were novel and have not been described as being expressed
either in DE or the pancreas.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified 27 genes, including 4 novel genes expressed in DE and 
pancreatic progenitor cells during normal development using an ES cell in vitro
differentiation system. These results showed that DE cells and
Pdx1/GFP-expressing cells obtained from our M15 based differentiation method
mimic cells during the normal developmental processes. Additionally, ES cells are
an excellent model for studies of early developmental processes.

Foxp4 is essential in maintenance of Purkinje cell dendritic arborization in the 
mouse cerebellum.

Shatin, Hong Kong, PR China.

Purkinje cells (PCs) are one of the principal neurons in the cerebellar cortex
that play a central role in the coordination of fine-tuning body movement and
balance. To acquire normal cerebellum function, PCs develop extensive dendritic
arbors that establish synaptic connections with the parallel fibers of granule
cells to form the proper neuronal circuitry. Therefore, dendritic arborization of
PCs is an important developmental step to construct the mature neural network in 
the cerebellum. However, the genetic control of this process is not fully
understood. In this study, Foxp4, a forkhead transcription factor that is
expressed specifically in migrating and mature PCs of cerebellum from embryonic
stages to adulthood, was knocked down by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in
organotypic cerebellar slice culture. When Foxp4 expression was knocked down at
postnatal day 5 (P5), no abnormalities for early dendritic remodeling of PCs were
observed. However, when Foxp4 was knocked down in P10 cerebellar slices, the
organization of PC dendritic arbors was highly impaired, leaving hypoplastic but 
non-apoptotic cell bodies. The radial alignment of Bergmann glial fibers that
associated with PC dendrites was also lost. These results suggest that Foxp4 is
dispensable for the early PC dendrite outgrowth, but is essential for the
maintenance of PC dendritic arborization and subsequent association with Bergmann
glial fibers.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignancies in males throughout the
world, and its incidence is increasing in Asian countries. We carried out a
genome-wide association study and replication study using 4,584 Japanese men with
prostate cancer and 8,801 control subjects. From the thirty-one associated SNPs
reported in previous genome-wide association studies in European populations, we 
confirmed the association of nine SNPs at P < 1.0 x 10(-7) and ten SNPs at P <
0.05 in the Japanese population. The remaining 12 SNPs showed no association (P >
0.05). In addition, we report here five new loci for prostate cancer
susceptibility, at 5p15 (lambda-corrected probability P(GC) = 3.9 x 10(-18)),
GPRC6A/RFX6 (P(GC) = 1.6 x 10(-12)), 13q22 (P(GC) = 2.8 x 10(-9)), C2orf43 (P(GC)
= 7.5 x 10(-8)) and FOXP4 (P(GC) = 7.6 x 10(-8)). These findings advance our
understanding of the genetic basis of prostate carcinogenesis and also highlight 
the genetic heterogeneity of prostate cancer susceptibility among different
ethnic populations.

Alternative splicing and gene duplication in the evolution of the FoxP gene
subfamily.

Santos ME(1), Athanasiadis A, Leitão AB, DuPasquier L, Sucena E.

Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.

The FoxP gene subfamily of transcription factors is defined by its characteristic
110 amino acid long DNA-binding forkhead domain and plays essential roles in
vertebrate biology. Its four members, FoxP1-P4, have been extensively
characterized functionally. FoxP1, FoxP2, and FoxP4 are involved in lung, heart, 
gut, and central nervous system (CNS) development. FoxP3 is necessary and
sufficient for the specification of regulatory T cells (Tregs) of the adaptive
immune system. In Drosophila melanogaster, in silico predictions identify one
unique FoxP subfamily gene member (CG16899) with no described function. We
characterized this gene and established that it generates by alternative splicing
two isoforms that differ in the forkhead DNA-binding domain. In D. melanogaster, 
both isoforms are expressed in the embryonic CNS, but in hemocytes, only isoform 
A is expressed, hinting to a putative modulation through alternative splicing of 
FoxP1 function in immunity and/or other hemocyte-dependent processes.
Furthermore, we show that in vertebrates, this novel alternative splicing pattern
is conserved for FoxP1. In mice, this new FoxP1 isoform is expressed in brain,
liver, heart, testes, thymus, and macrophages (equivalent in function to
hemocytes). This alternative splicing pattern has arisen at the base of the
Bilateria, probably through exon tandem duplication. Moreover, our phylogenetic
analysis suggests that in vertebrates, FoxP1 is more related to the FoxP gene
ancestral form and the other three paralogues, originated through serial
duplications, which only retained one of the alternative exons. Also, the newly
described isoform differs from the other in amino acids critical for DNA-binding 
specificity. The integrity of its fold is maintained, but the molecule has lost
the direct hydrogen bonding to DNA bases leading to a putatively lower
specificity and possibly affinity toward DNA. With the present comparative study,
through the integration of experimental and in silico studies of the FoxP gene
subfamily across the animal kingdom, we establish a new model for the FoxP gene
in invertebrates and for the vertebrate FoxP1 paralogue. Furthermore, we present 
a scenario for the structural evolution of this gene class and reveal new
previously unsuspected levels of regulation for FoxP1 in the vertebrate system.

To determine the underlying mechanism of Foxp1/2/4-mediated transcriptional
repression, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed that identified p66beta, a
transcriptional repressor and component of the NuRD chromatin-remodeling complex.
We show that direct interactions between Foxp1/4 and p66beta are mediated by the 
CR2 domain within p66beta and the zinc finger/leucine zipper repression domain
found in Foxp1/2/4. These direct interactions are functionally relevant as
overexpression of p66beta in combination with Foxp factors cooperatively
represses Foxp target gene expression, whereas loss of p66 and Foxp factors
results in de-repression of endogenous Foxp target genes in lung epithelial
cells. Moreover, the NuRD components HDAC1/2 associate in a macromolecular
complex with Foxp proteins, and loss of expression or inhibition of HDAC1/2
activity leads to de-repression of Foxp target gene expression. Importantly, we
show in vivo that Foxp1 and HDAC2 act cooperatively to regulate expression of the
cytoprotective cytokine interleukin-6, which results in increased resistance to
hyperoxic lung injury in Foxp1/HDAC2 compound mutant animals. These data reveal
an important interaction between the Foxp transcription factors and the NuRD
chromatin-remodeling complex that modulates transcriptional repression critical
for the lung epithelial injury response.

FOXP2 mutation causes a severe inherited speech and language defect, while the
related transcription factors FOXP1, FOXP3 and FOXP4 are implicated in cancer.
FOXP2 mRNA and protein expression were characterised in normal human tissues,
haematological cell lines and multiple myeloma (MM) patients' samples. FOXP2 mRNA
and protein were absent in mononuclear cells from different anatomical sites,
lineages and stages of differentiation. However, FOXP2 mRNA and protein was
detected in several lymphoma (8/20) and all MM-derived cell lines (n = 4). FOXP2 
mRNA was expressed in bone marrow samples from 96% of MM patients (24/25), 66.7% 
of patients with the pre-neoplastic plasma cell proliferation monoclonal
gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) (6/9), but not in reactive plasma 
cells. The frequency of FOXP2 protein expression in CD138(+) plasma cells was
significantly higher in MGUS (P = 0.0005; mean 46.4%) and MM patients (P < or =
0.0001; mean 57.3%) than in reactive marrows (mean 2.5%). FOXP2 (>10% nuclear
positivity) was detectable in 90.2% of MM (55/61) and 90.9% of MGUS (10/11)
patients, showing more frequent expression than CD56 and labelling 75% of
CD56-negative MM (9/12). FOXP2 represents the first transcription factor whose
expression consistently differentiates normal and abnormal plasma cells and FOXP2
target genes are implicated in MM pathogenesis.

Sciences, Tokyo, Japan. hiroshi@mitils.jp

Many members of the Fox family are transcription factors that regulate the
morphogenesis of various organs. In the present study, we examined the expression
pattern of Foxp4, a member of the Foxp subfamily, and compared its pattern with
the patterns of Foxp2 and Foxp1 in the developing rat brain. In general, these
three Foxp genes shared partially overlapping and yet differentially regulated
expression patterns in the striatum, the cerebral cortex, and the thalamus during
development. In the developing dorsal telencephalon, a mediolateral gradient of
Foxp4 was present in the cortical primordium, with high levels in the ventricular
zone of the medial cortex. By contrast, no gradient of Foxp2 and Foxp1 was
detected in the dorsal telencephalon. At later stages, Foxp4 was expressed
throughout all cortical layers as opposed to the layer-specific expression of
Foxp2 and Foxp1. In the developing striatum, the pattern of Foxp4 expression was 
distinct from the patterns of Foxp2 and Foxp1. The spatial expression pattern of 
Foxp4 was similar to that of Foxp2 during the early embryonic stage. However,
from the late embryonic stage to postnatal day 4, Foxp4 was expressed in a
mediolateral gradient and decreased in the striosomal compartment, in contrast to
the striosomal expression of Foxp2 and homogeneous expression of Foxp1. Foxp4 was
developmentally down-regulated such that Foxp4 was undetectable in the forebrain 
after postnatal day 14, whereas Foxp2 and Foxp1 were persistently expressed in
adulthood. Given that Foxp4, Foxp2, and Foxp1 are capable of heterodimerization
for transcriptional regulation, the partially overlapping expression patterns of 
Foxp4, Foxp2, and Foxp1 in different domains of the developing forebrain suggest 
that each member and/or different combinatory actions of the Foxp subfamily may
play a pivotal role in regulating forebrain development.

FOXP3+ Tregs.

School, Nanjing, China.

The role of OX40 in the islet allograft tolerance, especially in the absence of
CD154 costimulation, remains poorly defined. In the present study, we used CD154 
deficient mice to critically examine the role of OX40 in the activation of T
effector cells and Foxp3+ Tregs and the effect of blocking OX40 on the induction 
of islet allograft tolerance. We found that blocking OX40 costimulation in CD154 
deficient mice induced donor specific tolerance but stimulating OX40 resulted in 
prompt islet allograft rejection. We also found that OX40 differentially
regulates T effector cells and Foxp3+ Tregs, OX40 signaling mediates
proliferation of CD154 deficient T effector cells but blocks the induction and
suppressor functions of Foxp3+ Tregs. Our data suggest that the role of OX40 in
the induction of islet allograft tolerance involves modifying not only the T
effector cells but also the Foxp3+ Tregs in CD154 deficient mice.

Chromosome translocations in the common epithelial cancers are abundant, yet
little is known about them. They have been thought to be almost all unbalanced
and therefore dismissed as mostly mediating tumour suppressor loss. We present a 
comprehensive analysis by array painting of the chromosome translocations of
breast cancer cell lines HCC1806, HCC1187 and ZR-75-30. In array painting,
chromosomes are isolated by flow cytometry, amplified and hybridized to DNA
microarrays. A total of 200 breakpoints were identified and all were mapped to 1 
Mb resolution on bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) arrays, then 40 selected
breakpoints, including all balanced breakpoints, were further mapped on
tiling-path BAC arrays or to around 2 kb resolution using oligonucleotide arrays.
Many more of the translocations were balanced at 1 Mb resolution than expected,
either reciprocal (eight in total) or balanced for at least one participating
chromosome (19 paired breakpoints). Second, many of the breakpoints were at genes
that are plausible targets of oncogenic translocation, including balanced breaks 
at CTCF, EP300/p300 and FOXP4. Two gene fusions were demonstrated, TAX1BP1-AHCY
and RIF1-PKD1L1. Our results support the idea that chromosome rearrangements may 
play an important role in common epithelial cancers such as breast cancer.

Gene expression profiling studies have reported up-regulated mRNA expression of
the FOXP1 forkhead transcription factor in response to normal B-cell activation
and high expression in a poor prognosis subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL). The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognostic importance
of FOXP1 protein expression in an independent series of DLBCL.First, the
specificity of our FOXP1 monoclonal antibody was verified by confirming that it
did not recognize the closely related FOXP2, FOXP3, or FOXP4 proteins. FOXP1
protein expression was then analyzed by immunohistochemistry using a DLBCL tissue
microarray constructed from 101 previously untreated de novo cases from the
British Columbia Cancer Agency. FOXP1 expression was scored as either positive
(>30% positive nuclei) or negative (<30% positive nuclei). The overall survival
curves clearly showed that patients grouped as FOXP1-positive (40%) had a
significantly decreased overall survival (P = 0.0001). FOXP1-positive patients
had a median overall survival of 1.6 years compared with 12.2 years in
FOXP1-negative cases. In addition, FOXP1-positive patients showed a clear trend
to earlier progression in comparison to the FOXP1-negative patients. The analysis
of FOXP1 expression within low, medium, and high International Prognostic Index
groupings found that FOXP1-negative patients had better overall survival within
each group indicating that FOXP1 expression has predictive value independent of
the International Prognostic Index subgrouping, a finding that was confirmed in
multivariate analysis. These initial results suggest that FOXP1 expression may be
important in DLBCL pathogenesis.

Human Forkhead-box (FOX) gene family consists of at least 43 members, including
FOXA1, FOXA2, FOXA3, FOXB1, FOXC1, FOXC2, FOXD1, FOXD2, FOXD3, FOXD4, FOXD5
(FOXD4L1), FOXD6 (FOXD4L3), FOXE1, FOXE2, FOXE3, FOXF1, FOXF2, FOXG1 (FOXG1B),
FOXH1, FOXI1, FOXJ1, FOXJ2, FOXJ3, FOXK1, FOXK2, FOXL1, FOXL2, FOXM1, FOXN1,
FOXN2 (HTLF), FOXN3 (CHES1), FOXN4, FOXN5 (FOXR1), FOXN6 (FOXR2), FOXO1 (FOXO1A),
FOXO2 (FOXO6), FOXO3 (FOXO3A), FOXO4 (MLLT7), FOXP1, FOXP2, FOXP3, FOXP4, and
FOXQ1. FOXE3-FOXD2 (1p33), FOXQ1-FOXF2-FOXC1 (6p25.3), and FOXF1-FOXC2-FOXL1
(16q24.1) loci are FOX gene clusters within the human genome. Members of FOX
subfamilies A-G, I-L and Q were grouped into class 1 FOX proteins, while members 
of FOX subfamilies H and M-P were grouped into class 2 FOX proteins. C-terminal
basic region within the FOX domain was the common feature of class 1 FOX
proteins. FOXH1 and FOXO1 mRNAs are expressed in human embryonic stem (ES) cells.
FOXC1, FOXC2, FOXE1, FOXE3, FOXL2, FOXN1, FOXP2 and FOXP3 genes are mutated in
human congenital disorders. FOXA1 gene is amplified and over-expressed in
esophageal and lung cancer. FOXM1 gene is up-regulated in pancreatic cancer and
basal cell carcinoma due to the transcriptional regulation by Sonic Hedgehog
(SHH) pathway. FOXO1 gene is fused to PAX3 or PAX7 genes in rhabdomyosarcoma.
FOXO3 and FOXO4 genes are fused to MLL gene in hematological malignancies.
Deregulation of FOX family genes leads to congenital disorders, diabetes
mellitus, or carcinogenesis. Expression profiles, genetic alterations and
epigenetic changes of FOX family genes as well as binding proteins and target
genes of FOX family transcription factors should be comprehensively investigated 
to develop novel therapeutics and preventives for human diseases.

Advanced cardiac morphogenesis does not require heart tube fusion.

USA.

The bilateral cardiac mesoderm migrates from the lateral region of the embryo to 
the ventral midline, where it fuses to form the primitive heart tube. It is
generally accepted that migration and fusion are essential for subsequent stages 
of cardiac morphogenesis. We present evidence that, in Foxp4 mutant embryonic
mice, each bilateral heart-forming region is capable of developing into a highly 
differentiated four-chambered mammalian heart in the absence of midline fusion.
These data demonstrate that left-right chamber specification, cardiac looping,
septation, cardiac myocyte differentiation, and endocardial cushion formation are
preprogrammed in the precardiac mesoderm and do not require midline positional
identity or heart tube fusion.

Transcriptional and DNA binding activity of the Foxp1/2/4 family is modulated by 
heterotypic and homotypic protein interactions.

Pennsylvania, 421 Curie Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

Foxp1, Foxp2, and Foxp4 are large multidomain transcriptional regulators
belonging to the family of winged-helix DNA binding proteins known as the Fox
family. Foxp1 and Foxp2 have been shown to act as transcriptional repressors,
while regulatory activity of the recently identified Foxp4 has not been
determined. Given the importance of this Fox gene subfamily in neural and lung
development, we sought to elucidate the mechanisms by which Foxp1, Foxp2, and
Foxp4 repress gene transcription. We show that like Foxp1 and Foxp2, Foxp4
represses transcription. Analysis of the N-terminal repression domain in Foxp1,
Foxp2, and Foxp4 shows that this region contains two separate and distinct
repression subdomains that are highly homologous termed subdomain 1 and subdomain
2. However, subdomain 2 is not functional in Foxp4. Screening for proteins that
interact with subdomains 1 and 2 of Foxp2 using yeast two-hybrid analysis
revealed that subdomain 2 binds to C-terminal binding protein 1, which can
synergistically repress transcription with Foxp1 and Foxp2, but not Foxp4.
Subdomain 1 contains a highly conserved leucine zipper similar to that found in
N-myc and confers homo- and heterodimerization to the Foxp1/2/4 family members.
These interactions are dependent on the conserved leucine zipper motif. Finally, 
we show that the integrity of this subdomain is essential for DNA binding, making
Foxp1, Foxp2, and Foxp4 the first Fox proteins that require dimerization for DNA 
binding. These data reveal a complex regulatory mechanism underlying Foxp1,
Foxp2, and Foxp4 activity, demonstrating that Foxp1, Foxp2, and Foxp4 are the
first Fox proteins reported whose activity is regulated by homo- and
heterodimerization.

Foxp4: a novel member of the Foxp subfamily of winged-helix genes co-expressed

(1)Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104,

In this study, we describe the isolation and characterization of Foxp4, a new
member of the Foxp subfamily of winged-helix transcription factors. The
full-length mouse Foxp4 cDNA encodes a 685-amino-acid protein that is similar to 
Foxp1 and Foxp2. Foxp4 gene expression is observed primarily in pulmonary,
neural, and gut tissues during embryonic development. To compare the protein
expression patterns of Foxp4 to Foxp1 and Foxp2, specific polyclonal antisera to 
each of these proteins was used in immunohistochemical analysis of mouse
embryonic tissues. All three proteins are expressed in lung epithelium with Foxp1
and Foxp4 expressed in both proximal and distal airway epithelium while Foxp2 is 
expressed primarily in distal epithelium. Foxp1 protein expression is also
observed in the mesenchyme and vascular endothelial cells of the lung. At
embryonic day 12.5, Foxp1 and Foxp2 are expressed in both the mucosal and
epithelial layers of the intestine. However, Foxp2 is expressed only in the outer
mucosal layer of the intestine and stomach later in development. Finally, Foxp4
is expressed exclusively in the epithelial cells of the developing intestine,
where, in late development, it is expressed in a gradient along the longitudinal 
axis of the villi.

Forkhead proteins have been demonstrated to play key roles in embryonic
development, cell cycle regulation, and oncogenesis. We report the
characterization of a new forkhead transcription factor, which is a member of the
FoxP subfamily. In adult tissues FoxP4 is expressed in heart, brain, lung, liver,
kidney, and testis. By Northern hybridization, very low levels of FoxP4
expression were found as early as E7 during embryonic development. Embryonic
expression was highest at E11 and subsequently decreased at E15 and E17. In situ 
hybridization revealed expression of FoxP4 in the developing lung and gut,
suggesting a role for FoxP4 during the development of these organs. In addition, 
FoxP4 was found to be significantly reduced in patients with kidney tumors.
Lastly, FoxP4 matches an uncharacterized human EST that has previously been shown
to be down-regulated in larynx carcinoma.
