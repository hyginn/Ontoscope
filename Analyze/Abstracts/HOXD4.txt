Spinal extradural arachnoid cyst (SEDAC) is a cyst in the spinal canal that
protrudes into the epidural space from a defect in the dura mater and leads to
neurological disturbances. We previously showed that familial SEDAC is caused by 
FOXC2 mutation; however, the causal gene of sporadic SEDAC has not been
identified. To identify the causal gene of sporadic SEDAC, we performed whole
exome sequencing for 12 subjects with sporadic SEDAC and identified heterozygous 
HOXD4 loss-of-function mutations in three subjects. HOXD4 haplo-insufficiency
causes SEDAC and a transcriptional network containing HOXD4 and FOXC2 is involved
in the development of the dura mater and the etiology of SEDAC.

Epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation in context of cardiovascular diseases
are of considerable interest. So far, our current knowledge of the DNA
methylation profiles for atherosclerosis affected and healthy human vascular
tissues is still limited. Using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation27
BeadChip, we performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in right
coronary artery in the area of advanced atherosclerotic plaques,
atherosclerotic-resistant internal mammary arteries, and great saphenous veins
obtained from same patients with coronary heart disease. The resulting DNA
methylation patterns were markedly different between all the vascular tissues.
The genes hypomethylated in athero-prone arteries to compare with
atherosclerotic-resistant arteries were predominately involved in regulation of
inflammation and immune processes, as well as development. The great saphenous
veins exhibited an increase of the DNA methylation age in comparison to the
internal mammary arteries. Gene ontology analysis for genes harboring
hypermethylated CpG-sites in veins revealed the enrichment for biological
processes associated with the development. Four CpG-sites located within the
MIR10B gene sequence and about 1 kb upstream of the HOXD4 gene were also
confirmed as hypomethylated in the independent dataset of the right coronary
arteries in the area of advanced atherosclerotic plaques in comparison with the
other vascular tissues. The DNA methylation differences observed in vascular
tissues of patients with coronary heart disease can provide new insights into the
mechanisms underlying the development of pathology and explanation for the
difference in graft patency after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.

Aberrant expression of miR-10b has been described in many cancers but remains
unexplored in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Therefore, we aimed to study the
miR-10b expression level in 43 NPC biopsies collected from Tunisian patients and 
three NPC xenografts. Then, we investigated the correlation between miR-10b
expression and its upstream regulators LMP1/Twist1 as well as its adjacent gene
HoxD4. We showed that miR-10b was significantly up-regulated in NPC biopsies
compared to non-tumor nasopharyngeal tissues (fold change 153; p = 0.004) and
associated with advanced clinical stage and young age at diagnosis (p = 0.005 and
p = 0.011, respectively). In addition, over-expression of miR-10b was positively 
associated with the transcription factor Twist1 as well as the EBV oncoprotein
LMP1 (fold change 6.32; p = 0.014, fold change 6.58; p = 0.01 respectively).
Furthermore, higher level of miR-10b was observed in tumors with simultaneous
expression of LMP1 and Twist1, compared to those expressing only Twist1 (fold
change 2.49; p = 0.033). Meanwhile, the analysis of the link between miR-10b and 
its neighbor gene HoxD4 did not show any significant correlation (Fisher test p =
0.205; Mann-Whitney test p = 0.676). This study reports the first evidence of
miR-10b over-expression in NPC patients. Furthermore, our findings can support
hsa-miR-10b gene regulation through LMP1/Twist1 in NPC malignancy.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: In addition to genome-wide association studies (GWAS),
height-associated genes may be uncovered by studying individuals with extreme
short or tall stature.
METHODS: Genome-wide analysis for copy number variants (CNVs), using single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, was performed in 49 index cases born small 
for gestational age with persistent short stature. Segregation analysis was
performed, and genes in CNVs were compared with information from GWAS, gene
expression in rodents' growth plates, and published information.
RESULTS: CNVs were detected in 13 cases. In 5 children a known cause of short
stature was found: UPD7, UPD14, a duplication of the SHOX enhancer region, an
IGF1R deletion, and a 22q11.21 deletion. In the remaining 8 cases, potential
pathogenic CNVs were detected, either de novo (n = 1), segregating (n = 2), or
not segregating with short stature (n = 5). Bioinformatic analysis of the de novo
and segregating CNVs suggested that HOXD4, AGPS, PDE11A, OSBPL6, PRKRA and
PLEKHA3, and possibly DGKB and TNFRSF11B are potential candidate genes. A
SERPINA7 or NRK defect may be associated with an X-linked form of short stature.
CONCLUSION: SNP arrays detected 5 known causes of short stature with prenatal
onset and suggested several potential candidate genes.

The endothelial cell has a remarkable ability for sub-specialisation, adapted to 
the needs of a variety of vascular beds. The role of developmental programming
versus the tissue contextual environment for this specialization is not well
understood. Here we describe a hierarchy of expression of HOX genes associated
with endothelial cell origin and location. In initial microarray studies,
differential gene expression was examined in two endothelial cell lines: blood
derived outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) and pulmonary artery endothelial
cells. This suggested shared and differential patterns of HOX gene expression
between the two endothelial lines. For example, this included a cluster on
chromosome 2 of HOXD1, HOXD3, HOXD4, HOXD8 and HOXD9 that was expressed at a
higher level in BOECs. Quantative PCR confirmed the higher expression of these
HOXs in BOECs, a pattern that was shared by a variety of microvascular
endothelial cell lines. Subsequently, we analysed publically available
microarrays from a variety of adult cell and tissue types using the whole "HOX
transcriptome" of all 39 HOX genes. Using hierarchical clustering analysis the
HOX transcriptome was able to discriminate endothelial cells from 61 diverse
human cell lines of various origins. In a separate publically available
microarray dataset of 53 human endothelial cell lines, the HOX transcriptome
additionally organized endothelial cells related to their organ or tissue of
origin. Human tissue staining for HOXD8 and HOXD9 confirmed endothelial
expression and also supported increased microvascular expression of these HOXs.
Together these observations suggest a significant involvement of HOX genes in
endothelial cell positional identity.

Hox genes encode a conserved family of homeodomain transcription factors
regulating development along the major body axis. During embryogenesis, Hox
proteins are expressed in segment-specific patterns and control numerous
different segment-specific cell fates. It has been unclear, however, whether Hox 
proteins drive the epithelial cell segregation mechanism that is thought to
initiate the segmentation process. Here, we investigate the role of vertebrate
Hox proteins during the partitioning of the developing hindbrain into
lineage-restricted units called rhombomeres. Loss-of-function mutants and ectopic
expression assays reveal that Hoxb4 and its paralogue Hoxd4 are necessary and
sufficient for cell segregation, and for the most caudal rhombomere boundary
(r6/r7). Hox4 proteins regulate Eph/ephrins and other cell-surface proteins, and 
can function in a non-cell-autonomous manner to induce apical cell enlargement on
both sides of their expression border. Similarly, other Hox proteins expressed at
more rostral rhombomere interfaces can also regulate Eph/ephrins, induce apical
remodelling and drive cell segregation in ectopic expression assays. However,
Krox20, a key segmentation factor expressed in odd rhombomeres (r3 and r5), can
largely override Hox proteins at the level of regulation of a cell surface
target, Epha4. This study suggests that most, if not all, Hox proteins share a
common potential to induce cell segregation but in some contexts this is masked
or modulated by other transcription factors.

To date, only the five most posterior groups of Hox genes, Hox9-Hox13, have
demonstrated loss-of-function roles in limb patterning. Individual paralog groups
control proximodistal patterning of the limb skeletal elements. Hox9 genes also
initiate the onset of Hand2 expression in the posterior forelimb compartment, and
collectively, the posterior HoxA/D genes maintain posterior Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) 
expression. Here we show that an anterior Hox paralog group, Hox5, is required
for forelimb anterior patterning. Deletion of all three Hox5 genes (Hoxa5, Hoxb5,
and Hoxc5) leads to anterior forelimb defects resulting from derepression of Shh 
expression. The phenotype requires the loss of all three Hox5 genes,
demonstrating the high level of redundancy in this Hox paralogous group. Further 
analyses reveal that Hox5 interacts with promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger
biochemically and genetically to restrict Shh expression. These findings, along
with previous reports showing that point mutations in the Shh limb enhancer lead 
to similar anterior limb defects, highlight the importance of Shh repression for 
proper patterning of the vertebrate limb.

Spatial/temporal controls of development are regulated by the homeotic (HOX) gene
complex and require integration with oncogenes and tumour suppressors regulating 
cell cycle exit. Spontaneously derived neoplastic canine mammary carcinoma cell
models were investigated to determine if HOX expression profiles were associated 
with neoplasia as HOX genes promote neoplastic potential in human cancers.
Comparative assessment of human and canine breast cancer expression profiles
revealed remarkable similarity for all four paralogous HOX gene clusters and
several unlinked HOX genes. Five canine HOX genes were overexpressed with
expression profiles consistent with oncogene-like character (HOXA1, HOXA13,
HOXD4, HOXD9 and SIX1) and three HOX genes with underexpressed profiles (HOXA11, 
HOXC8 and HOXC9) were also identified as was an apparent nonsense mutation in
HOXC6. This data, as well as a comparative analysis of similar data from human
breast cancers suggested expression of selected HOX genes in canine mammary
carcinoma could be contributing to the neoplastic phenotype.

To date the question of epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation in the context
of cardiovascular diseases is of a considerable interest. Here, for the first
time DNA methylation profiles of vascular tissues of atherosclerotic patients
have been analyzed with using the microarray Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip
("Illumina", USA). As the result, within 286 genes 314 CpG-sites that varied
significantly in the DNA methylation level between the tissue samples of carotid 
(in the area of atherosclerotic plaques and nearby macroscopically intact tissues
of the vascular wall) and mammary arteries as well saphenous veins have been
identified. The most pronounced differences in the methylation level were
registered for CpG-sites of homeobox genes HOXA2 and HOXD4 as well as imprinted
gene MEST. In particular, these genes were found to be hypomethylated in the
carotid atherosclerotic plaques compared to their methylation patterns in intact 
tissues of internal mammary arteries and saphenous veins.

Hox genes encode transcription factors that regulate embryonic and post-embryonic
developmental processes. The expression of Hox genes is regulated in part by the 
tight, spatial arrangement of conserved coding and non-coding sequences. The
potential for evolutionary changes in Hox cluster structure is thought to be low 
among vertebrates; however, recent studies of a few non-mammalian taxa suggest
greater variation than originally thought. Using next generation sequencing of
large genomic fragments (>100 kb) from the red spotted newt (Notophthalamus
viridescens), we found that the arrangement of Hox cluster genes was conserved
relative to orthologous regions from other vertebrates, but the length of introns
and intergenic regions varied. In particular, the distance between hoxd13 and
hoxd11 is longer in newt than orthologous regions from vertebrate species with
expanded Hox clusters and is predicted to exceed the length of the entire HoxD
clusters (hoxd13-hoxd4) of humans, mice, and frogs. Many repetitive DNA sequences
were identified for newt Hox clusters, including an enrichment of DNA
transposon-like sequences relative to non-coding genomic fragments. Our results
suggest that Hox cluster expansion and transposon accumulation are common
features of non-mammalian tetrapod vertebrates.

Zebrafish hoxd4a acts upstream of meis1.1 to direct vasculogenesis, angiogenesis 
and hematopoiesis.

Mice lacking the 4th-group paralog Hoxd4 display malformations of the anterior
vertebral column, but are viable and fertile. Here, we report that zebrafish
embryos having decreased function of the orthologous hoxd4a gene manifest
striking perturbations in vasculogenesis, angiogenesis and primitive and
definitive hematopoiesis. These defects are preceded by reduced expression of the
hemangioblast markers scl1, lmo2 and fli1 within the posterior lateral plate
mesoderm (PLM) at 13 hours post fertilization (hpf). Epistasis analysis revealed 
that hoxd4a acts upstream of meis1.1 but downstream of cdx4 as early as the
shield stage in ventral-most mesoderm fated to give rise to hemangioblasts,
leading us to propose that loss of hoxd4a function disrupts hemangioblast
specification. These findings place hoxd4a high in a genetic hierarchy directing 
hemangioblast formation downstream of cdx1/cdx4 and upstream of meis1.1. An
additional consequence of impaired hoxd4a and meis1.1 expression is the
deregulation of multiple Hox genes implicated in vasculogenesis and hematopoiesis
which may further contribute to the defects described here. Our results add to
evidence implicating key roles for Hox genes in their initial phase of expression
early in gastrulation.

To develop in vivo assays for homeobox gene function in neural development, we
generated transgenic mice in which the expression of a homeobox gene is altered
only within the nervous system, in neurons or neuronal precursor cells.
Transgenic expression of Hoxc8 did not result in gross abnormalities, while a
Hoxd4 transgene caused death shortly after birth. In neural progenitor cells, the
motorneuron-specific homeodomain transcription factor Isl1 induced early
developmental defects, including absence of anterior neural structures, profound 
defects in the neuroepithelium and defective neural tube closure. A fraction of
Isl1 transgenic mice exhibited spina bifida. Isl1 transgene expression was also
associated with decreased proliferation and increased Pbx1 expression in the
ventral neural tube. Our results suggest a function for some homeobox genes in
development of the nervous system, and that cell-type- and region-specific
transgenic models will be useful to identify the cellular and molecular targets
of homeobox transcription factors in nervous system development.

Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs involved in
posttranslational gene silencing. Previous studies found that downregulation of
miRNAs is a common feature observed in solid tumors, including hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). We employed a genome-wide approach to test the hypothesis that
DNA methylation alterations in miRNA host genes may cause deregulated miRNA
expression in HCC. We analyzed tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from 62
Taiwanese HCC cases using Infinium HumanMethylation27 DNA Analysis BeadChips that
include 254 CpG sites covering 110 miRNAs from 64 host genes. Expression levels
of three identified miRNAs (miR-10a, miR-10b and miR-196b) were measured in a
subset of 37 HCC tumor and non-tumor tissues. After Bonferroni adjustment, a
total of 54 CpG sites from 27 host genes significantly differed in DNA
methylation levels between tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues with 53 sites
significantly hypermethylated in tumor tissues. Among the 54 significant CpG
sites, 15 sites had more than 2-fold tumor/non-tumor changes, 17 sites had
differences > 10%, and 10 sites had both features [including 8 significantly
hypermethylated CpG sites in the host genes of miR-10a, miR-10b and miR-196b
(HOXB4, HOXD4 and HOXA9, respectively)]. Significant downregulation of miR-10a
was observed in tumor compared with non-tumor tissues (0.50 vs. 1.73, p = 0.031).
The concordance for HOXB4 methylation alteration and dysregulation of miR-10a was
73.5%. No significant change was observed for miR-10b expression. Unexpectedly,
miR-196b was significantly upregulated in tumor compared with non-tumor tissues
(p = 0.0001). These data suggest that aberrant DNA methylation may lead to
dysregulation of miR-10a in HCC tumor tissues.

Retinoic acid (RA) can induce growth arrest and neuronal differentiation of
neuroblastoma cells and has been used in clinic for treatment of neuroblastoma.
It has been reported that RA induces the expression of several HOXD genes in
human neuroblastoma cell lines, but their roles in RA action are largely unknown.
The HOXD cluster contains nine genes (HOXD1, HOXD3, HOXD4, and HOXD8-13) that are
positioned sequentially from 3' to 5', with HOXD1 at the 3' end and HOXD13 the 5'
end. Here we show that all HOXD genes are induced by RA in the human
neuroblastoma BE(2)-C cells, with the genes located at the 3' end being activated
generally earlier than those positioned more 5' within the cluster. Individual
induction of HOXD8, HOXD9, HOXD10 or HOXD12 is sufficient to induce both growth
arrest and neuronal differentiation, which is associated with downregulation of
cell cycle-promoting genes and upregulation of neuronal differentiation genes.
However, induction of other HOXD genes either has no effect (HOXD1) or has
partial effects (HOXD3, HOXD4, HOXD11 and HOXD13) on BE(2)-C cell proliferation
or differentiation. We further show that knockdown of HOXD8 expression, but not
that of HOXD9 expression, significantly inhibits the differentiation-inducing
activity of RA. HOXD8 directly activates the transcription of HOXC9, a key
effector of RA action in neuroblastoma cells. These findings highlight the
distinct functions of HOXD genes in RA induction of neuroblastoma cell
differentiation.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of methylation alteration in inflamed muscles 
from children with juvenile dermatomyositis (DM) and other idiopathic
inflammatory myopathies (IIMs).
METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging-directed diagnostic muscle biopsies yielded
samples from 20 children with juvenile DM, which were used for genome-wide DNA
methylation profiling, as were muscle biopsy samples from 4 healthy controls.
Bisulfite treatment followed by pyrosequencing confirmed methylation status in
juvenile DM and other IIMs. Immunohistochemistry defined localization and
expression levels of WT1.
RESULTS: Comparison of genome-wide DNA methylation profiling between juvenile DM 
muscle and normal control muscle revealed 27 genes with a significant methylation
difference between the groups. These genes were enriched with transcription
factors and/or cell cycle regulators and were unrelated to duration of untreated 
disease. Six homeobox genes were among them; ALX4, HOXC11, HOXD3, and HOXD4 were 
hypomethylated, while EMX2 and HOXB1 were hypermethylated. WT1 was significantly 
hypomethylated in juvenile DM (<U+0394>ß = -0.41, P < 0.001). Bisulfite pyrosequencing
verification in samples from 56 patients with juvenile DM confirmed the
methylation alterations of these genes. Similar methylation alterations were
observed in juvenile polymyositis (n = 5) and other IIMs (n = 9). Concordant with
the other findings, WT1 protein was increased in juvenile DM muscle, with average
positive staining of 11.6%, but was undetectable in normal muscle (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that affected muscles of children with juvenile
DM and IIMs have the capacity to be repaired, and that homeobox and WT1 genes are
epigenetically marked to facilitate this repair process, potentially suggesting
new avenues of therapeutic intervention.

The enzymes responsible for the rate-limiting step in retinoic acid biosynthesis,
the oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde, during embryogenesis and in adulthood 
have not been fully defined. Here, we report that a novel member of the short
chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily, frog sdr16c5, acts as a highly active 
retinol dehydrogenase (rdhe2) that promotes retinoic acid biosynthesis when
expressed in mammalian cells. In vivo assays of rdhe2 function show that
overexpression of rdhe2 in frog embryos leads to posteriorization and induction
of defects resembling those caused by retinoic acid toxicity. Conversely,
antisense morpholino-mediated knockdown of endogenous rdhe2 results in phenotypes
consistent with retinoic acid deficiency, such as defects in anterior neural tube
closure, microcephaly with small eye formation, disruption of somitogenesis, and 
curved body axis with bent tail. Higher doses of morpholino induce embryonic
lethality. Analyses of retinoic acid levels using either endogenous retinoic
acid-sensitive gene hoxd4 or retinoic acid reporter cell line both show that the 
levels of retinoic acid are significantly decreased in rdhe2 morphants. Taken
together, these results provide strong evidence that Xenopus rdhe2 functions as a
retinol dehydrogenase essential for frog embryonic development in vivo.
Importantly, the retinol oxidizing activity of frog rdhe2 is conserved in its
mouse homologs, suggesting that rdhe2-related enzymes may represent the
previously unrecognized physiologically relevant retinol dehydrogenases that
contribute to retinoic acid biosynthesis in higher vertebrates.

transcript encoding miR-10b and HOXD4.

Patterning of the animal embryo's antero-posterior (AP) axis is dependent on
spatially and temporally regulated Hox gene expression. The murine Hoxd4 gene has
been proposed to harbour two promoters, an upstream promoter P2, and a downstream
promoter P1, that lie 5.2 and 1.1 kilobase pairs (kb) upstream of the coding
region respectively. The evolutionarily conserved microRNA-10b (miR-10b) gene
lies in the Hoxd4 genomic locus in the intron separating the non-coding exons 4
and 5 of the P2 transcript and directly adjacent to the proposed P1 promoter.
Hoxd4 transcription is regulated by a 3' neural enhancer that harbours a retinoic
acid response element (RARE). Here, we show that the expression profiles of Hoxd4
and miR-10b transcripts during neural differentiation of mouse embryonal
carcinoma (EC) P19 cells are co-ordinately regulated, suggesting that both Hoxd4 
and miR-10b expression is governed by the neural enhancer. Our observation that
P1 transcripts are uncapped, together with the mapping of their 5' ends, strongly
suggests that they are generated by Drosha cleavage of P2 transcripts rather than
by transcriptional initiation. This is supported by the colocalization of P1 and 
P2 transcripts to the same posterior expression domain in the mouse embryo. These
uncapped P1 transcripts do not appear to possess an Internal Ribosomal Entry Site
(IRES), but accumulate within multiple punctate bodies within the nucleus
suggesting that they play a functional role. Finally, similar uncapped
Drosha-cleaved P1-like transcripts originating from the paralogous Hoxb4/miR-10a 
locus were also identified. We propose that these transcripts may belong to a
novel class of regulatory RNAs.

HOX proteins are transcription factors that play a major role in patterning the
body axis of vertebrates from the gastrulation stage. While nothing has been
reported so far about their roles at earlier stages, there is evidence that some 
HOX genes are expressed before gastrulation. The objective of this work was to
study the pattern of expression of several HOX genes during oocyte maturation and
early embryonic development up to the blastocyst stage. Using nested PCR, HOXD1, 
HOXA3, HOXD4, HOXB7, HOXB9, and HOXC9 transcripts were detected in bovine oocytes
and early embryos at various frequencies depending on the stage of development.
Quantitative PCR was performed on bovine oocytes and early embryos: relative
expression of HOXD1, HOXA3, and HOXC9 decreased sharply after the 5-8 cell stage.
HOXB9 relative expression increased between the oocyte and the morula stage. All 
transcripts seemed to be of maternal origin before the maternal to embryonic
transition, as demonstrated by blocking transcription with a-amanitin. Reverse
transcription was performed with either hexamers or oligo-dT, allowing for the
determination that HOXC9 transcripts were slightly deadenylated during oocyte
maturation; HOXD1, HOXA3, and HOXB9 transcripts were not, indicating that they
could be translated. Hoxd1, Hoxa3, Hoxb9, and Hoxc9 expression was also detected 
in mouse oocytes and early embryos. A similar pattern of expression was found in 
the two species. In conclusion, mammalian HOX genes might be implicated in the
control of oocyte maturation, the maternal-to-embryonic transition or the first
steps of embryo differentiation.

Epigenetic regulation of microRNA-10b and targeting of oncogenic MAPRE1 in
gastric cancer.

MicroRNAs act as negative regulators of gene expression, and the altered
expression of microRNAs by epigenetic mechanisms is strongly implicated in
carcinogenesis. Here we report that the microRNA-10b gene (miR-10b) was silenced 
in gastric cancer cells by promoter methylation. In this study, using a
methylation array and bisulfate pyrosequencing analysis, we found
that miR-10b promoter CpGs were heavily methylated in gastric cancers.
Clinicopathologic data showed that miR-10b methylation increased with patient age
and occurred significantly more frequently in intestinal-type (28/44, 64%) than
in diffuse-type (22/56, 39%) gastric cancers (P = 0.016). In
addition, miR-10b methylation was also associated with an increase in expression 
of the oncogene that encodes microtubule-associated protein, RP/EB family, member
1 (MAPRE1; P = 0.004), which was identified as a potential miR-10b target. After 
5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment of gastric cancer cells, miR-10b methylation was
significantly decreased, and expression of miR-10b and HOXD4, which is 1 kb
downstream of miR-10b, was greatly restored. Moreover, decreased MAPRE1
expression coincided with increased miR-10b expression, suggesting
that miR-10b targets MAPRE1 transcription. We also found that transfection with
precursor miR-10b into gastric cancer cells dramatically decreased MAPRE1 mRNA
and protein, resulting in a significant decrease in colony formation and cell
growth rates. Thus, we show a tumor-suppressive role for miR-10b in gastric
carcinogenesis. miR-10b methylation may be a useful molecular biomarker for
assessing the risk of gastric cancer development, and modulation of miR-10b may
represent a therapeutic approach for treating gastric cancer.

The LARGE principle of cellular reprogramming: lost, acquired and retained gene
expression in foreskin and amniotic fluid-derived human iPS cells.

Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, Berlin, Germany.

Human amniotic fluid cells (AFCs) are routinely obtained for prenatal diagnostics
procedures. Recently, it has been illustrated that these cells may also serve as 
a valuable model system to study developmental processes and for application in
regenerative therapies. Cellular reprogramming is a means of assigning greater
value to primary AFCs by inducing self-renewal and pluripotency and, thus,
bypassing senescence. Here, we report the generation and characterization of
human amniotic fluid-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (AFiPSCs) and
demonstrate their ability to differentiate into the trophoblast lineage after
stimulation with BMP2/BMP4. We further carried out comparative transcriptome
analyses of primary human AFCs, AFiPSCs, fibroblast-derived iPSCs (FiPSCs) and
embryonic stem cells (ESCs). This revealed that the expression of key
senescence-associated genes are down-regulated upon the induction of pluripotency
in primary AFCs (AFiPSCs). By defining distinct and overlapping gene expression
patterns and deriving the LARGE (Lost, Acquired and Retained Gene Expression)
Principle of Cellular Reprogramming, we could further highlight that AFiPSCs,
FiPSCs and ESCs share a core self-renewal gene regulatory network driven by OCT4,
SOX2 and NANOG. Nevertheless, these cell types are marked by distinct gene
expression signatures. For example, expression of the transcription factors,
SIX6, EGR2, PKNOX2, HOXD4, HOXD10, DLX5 and RAXL1, known to regulate
developmental processes, are retained in AFiPSCs and FiPSCs. Surprisingly,
expression of the self-renewal-associated gene PRDM14 or the developmental
processes-regulating genes WNT3A and GSC are restricted to ESCs. Implications of 
this, with respect to the stability of the undifferentiated state and long-term
differentiation potential of iPSCs, warrant further studies.

AIM: To determine the associations between HOXD4 gene polymorphisms with peak
bone mineral density (BMD) throughing measuring three tagging single nucleotide
polymorphisms (tagSNPs), including rs1867863, rs13418078, and rs4972504, in
HOXD4.
METHODS: Four hundred Chinese nuclear families with male offspring (1215
subjects) and 401 Chinese nuclear families with female offspring (1260 subjects) 
were recruited. BMD of the lumbar spine 1-4 (L1-4) and left proximal femur
including total hip and femoral neck were measured by dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry. The quantitative transmission disequilibrium test (QTDT) was
performed to investigate the association among the tagging SNPs, haplotypes and
peak BMD.
RESULTS: Only the CC genotype was identified in rs13418078 in the Chinese
population, unlike other populations. We failed to find significant within-family
association among these SNPs, haplotypes and peak BMD at any bone site in either 
male- or female-offspring nuclear families.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that genetic polymorphisms in HOXD4 may not be a 
major contributor to the observed variability in peak BMD in the lumbar spine and
the hip in Chinese men and women.

Microarray Analysis of Defective Cartilage in Hoxc8- and Hoxd4-Transgenic Mice.

University System, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA.

OBJECTIVE: Homeobox genes of the Hox class are required for proper patterning of 
skeletal elements and play a role in cartilage differentiation. In transgenic
mice with overexpression of Hoxc8 and Hoxd4 during cartilage development, the
authors observed severe defects, namely, physical instability of cartilage,
accumulation of immature chondrocytes, and decreased maturation to hypertrophy.
To define the molecular basis underlying these defects, the authors performed
gene expression profiling using the Affymetrix microarray platform.
RESULTS: Primary chondrocytes were isolated from Hoxc8- and Hoxd4-transgenic
mouse embryo rib cartilage at 18.5 days of gestation. In both cases,
differentially expressed genes were identified that have a role in cell
proliferation and cell cycle regulation. A comparison between the controls for
both experimental groups did not reveal significant differences, as expected.
However, the repertoires of differentially expressed genes were found not to
overlap between Hoxc8- and Hoxd4-transgenic cartilage. This included different
Wnt genes, cell cycle, and apoptosis regulators.
CONCLUSION: Overexpression of Hoxc8 and Hoxd4 transcription factors alters
transcriptional profiles in chondrocytes at E18.5. The differences in repertoires
of altered gene expression between the 2 transgenic conditions suggest that the
molecular mechanisms underlying the cartilage defects may be different in both
transgenic paradigms, despite apparently similar phenotypes.

Expression of cartilage developmental genes in Hoxc8- and Hoxd4-transgenic mice.

Kruger C(1), Kappen C.

Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.

Hox genes encode transcription factors, which regulate skeletal patterning and
chondrocyte differentiation during the development of cartilage, the precursor to
mature bone. Overexpression of the homeobox transcription factors Hoxc8 and Hoxd4
causes severe cartilage defects due to delay in cartilage maturation. Matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs), bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and fibroblastic
growth factors (FGFs) are known to play important roles in skeletal development
and endochondral bone formation and remodeling. In order to investigate whether
these molecules are aberrantly expressed in Hoxc8- and/or Hoxd4-transgenic
cartilage, we performed quantitative RT-PCR on chondrocytes from Hox-transgenic
mice. Gene expression levels of Bmp4, Fgf8, Fgf10, Mmp9, Mmp13, Nos3, Timp3,
Wnt3a and Wnt5a were altered in Hoxc8-transgenic chondrocytes, and Fgfr3, Ihh,
Mmp8, and Wnt3a expression levels were altered in Hoxd4-transgenic chondrocytes, 
respectively. Notably, Wnt3a expression was elevated in Hoxc8- and reduced in
Hoxd4-transgenic cartilage. These results suggest that both transcription factors
affect cartilage maturation through different molecular mechanisms, and provide
the basis for future studies into the role of these genes and possible
interactions in pathogenesis of cartilage defects in Hoxc8- and Hoxd4-transgenic 
mice.

Xwnt8 directly initiates expression of labial Hox genes.

In der Rieden PM(1), Vilaspasa FL, Durston AJ.

Author information: 
(1)Hubrecht Laboratorium, Nederlands Instituut voor Ontwikkelingsbiologie,
Utrecht, The Netherlands.

Hox transcription factors play an essential role in patterning the
anteroposterior axis during embryogenesis and exhibit a complex array of spatial 
and temporal patterns of expression. Their earliest onset of expression in
vertebrates is during gastrulation in a temporally collinear sequence in the
presomitic/ventrolateral mesoderm, and it is not clear which upstream signal
transduction events initiate this expression. Using Xenopus, we present evidence 
that Xwnt8 is necessary for initiation of this collinear sequence by activating
Hox-1 expression in three Hox clusters: hoxd, hoxa, and hoxb. All three labial
genes appear to be direct targets of canonical Wnt signaling through Tcf/Lef. In 
addition, Xwnt8 loss- and gain-of-function leads to indirect regulation of other 
Hox genes: Hoxb4, Hoxd4, Hoxa7, Hoxc6, and Hoxc8. These findings shed new light
on the early role of Wnt8 as well as of a proposed WNT gradient in patterning the
Xenopus central nervous system (Kiecker and Niehrs [2001] Development
128:4189-4201).

The HOX family of genes plays a fundamental role in the morphogenesis of
vertebrate embryonic cells. HOX genes are thought to be important for the
regulation of stem cells. We investigated HOX gene expression in mesenchymal stem
cells (MSCs) from human placentas. We isolated MSCs from human placentas and
confirmed stemness by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis and
differentiation studies. Using reverse transcription PCR, mRNA expression of 39
Class I HOX genes was measured in the MSCs. The expression of HOXB6, C4, C8, C10,
D3, D4, and D10 were measured by Western blot analysis. HOXC10 was expressed in
10 of 10 amnion-derived MSCs but in only 2 of 10 decidua-derived MSCs. HOXC4 and 
D10 were expressed in 100% of both amnion-derived MSCs and deciduas-derived MSCs.
HOXD4 was silent in all amnion-derived MSCs and deciduas-derived MSCs (n = 10).
HOX gene activation patterns might be a useful indicator for the detection of
MSCs of different tissue origins. We demonstrated that HOXC10 is a gene that may 
discriminate between amnion-derived MSCs and decidua-derived MSCs.

Transcriptional inhibiton of Hoxd4 expression by miRNA-10a in human breast cancer
cells.

BACKGROUND: Small noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including short interfering RNAs
(siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), can silence genes at the transcriptional,
post-transcriptional or translational level 12.
RESULTS: Here, we show that microRNA-10a (miR-10a) targets a homologous DNA
region in the promoter region of the hoxd4 gene and represses its expression at
the transcriptional level. Mutational analysis of the miR-10a sequence revealed
that the 3' end of the miRNA sequence is the most critical element for the
silencing effect. MicroRNA-10a-induced transcriptional gene inhibition requires
the presence of Dicer and Argonautes 1 and 3, and it is related to promoter
associated noncoding RNAs. Bisulfite sequencing analysis showed that the reduced 
hoxd4 expression was accompanied by de novo DNA methylation at the hoxd4
promoter. We further demonstrated that trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27
(H3K27me3) is involved in the miR-10a-induced hoxd4 transcriptional gene silence.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our results demonstrate that miR-10a can regulate
human gene expression in a transcriptional manner, and indicate that endogenous
small noncoding RNA-induced control of transcription may be a potential system
for expressional regulation in human breast cancer cells.

Morpholino-mediated knockdown in primary chondrocytes implicates Hoxc8 in
regulation of cell cycle progression.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Nebraska
Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-5805, USA.

Numerous experiments in mutant and transgenic mice have implicated Hox
transcription factors in development of the skeletal system, postulating a role
for these proteins in cell proliferation of precursor cells and regulation of
cell differentiation. Our own data from Hoxc8 and Hoxd4 transgenic mice suggest
that Hoxc8 is involved in cell proliferation during cartilage development. In
order to directly assess its role in cell proliferation of a specific skeletal
cell type, the cartilage-producing chondrocyte, we performed morpholino-mediated 
knockdown experiments in normal primary chondrocytes. Through analysis of PCNA
expression and staining for phosphorylated Histone 3, two cell cycle markers, we 
show that interference with Hoxc8 expression in chondrocytes reduces cell
proliferation, but in the absence of apoptosis. Instead, cells with a knockdown
in Hoxc8 expression appear to be delayed in their progression through the cell
cycle. Our results provide evidence for prolonged duration of and delayed exit
from M-phase, thus implicating a role for Hoxc8 in controlling cell cycle
progression at this critical check point.

The antero-posterior (AP) and dorso-ventral (DV) patterning of the neural tube is
controlled in part by HOX and PAX transcription factors, respectively. We have
reported on a neural enhancer of Hoxd4 that directs expression in the CNS with
the correct anterior border in the hindbrain. Comparison to the orthologous
enhancer of zebrafish revealed seven conserved footprints including an obligatory
retinoic acid response element (RARE), and adjacent sites D, E and F. Whereas
enhancer function in the embryonic CNS is destroyed by separation of the RARE
from sites D-E-F by a half turn of DNA, it is rescued by one full turn,
suggesting stereospecific constraints between DNA-bound retinoid receptors and
the factor(s) recognizing sites D-E-F. Alterations in the DV trajectory of the
Hoxd4 anterior expression border following mutation of site D or E implicated
transcriptional regulators active across the DV axis. We show that PAX6
specifically binds sites D and E in vitro, and use chromatin immunoprecipitation 
to demonstrate recruitment of PAX6 to the Hoxd4 neural enhancer in mouse embryos.
Hoxd4 expression throughout the CNS is reduced in Pax6 mutant Sey(Neu) animals on
embryonic day 8. Additionally, stage-matched zebrafish embryos having decreased
pax6a and/or pax6b activity display malformed rhombomere boundaries and an
anteriorized hoxd4a expression border. These results reveal an evolutionarily
conserved role for Pax6 in AP-restricted expression of vertebrate Hoxd4
orthologs.

promoter during neural differentiation.

Correct patterning of the antero-posterior axis of the embryonic trunk is
dependent on spatiotemporally restricted Hox gene expression. In this study, we
identified components of the Hoxd4 P1 promoter directing expression in neurally
differentiating retinoic acid-treated P19 cells. We mapped three nucleosomes that
are subsequently remodeled into an open chromatin state upon retinoic
acid-induced Hoxd4 transcription. These nucleosomes spanned the Hoxd4
transcriptional start site in addition to a GC-rich positive regulatory element
located 3' to the initiation site. We further identified two major cis-acting
regulatory elements. An autoregulatory element was shown to recruit HOXD4 and its
cofactor PBX1 and to positively regulate Hoxd4 expression in differentiating P19 
cells. Conversely, the Polycomb group (PcG) protein Ying-Yang 1 (YY1) binds to an
internucleosomal linker and represses Hoxd4 transcription before and during
transcriptional activation. Sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation studies
revealed that the PcG protein MEL18 was co-recruited with YY1 only in
undifferentiated P19 cells, suggesting a role for MEL18 in silencing Hoxd4
transcription in undifferentiated P19 cells. This study links for the first time 
local chromatin remodeling events that take place during transcriptional
activation with the dynamics of transcription factor association and DNA
accessibility at a Hox regulatory region.

Expression of folate pathway genes in the cartilage of Hoxd4 and Hoxc8 transgenic
mice.

Kruger C(1), Talmadge C, Kappen C.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Nebraska
Medical Center, Omaha, 68198, USA.

BACKGROUND: Hox transcription factors are well known for their role in skeletal
patterning in vertebrates. They regulate gene expression during the development
of cartilage, the precursor to mature bone. We previously reported that
overexpression of the homeobox genes Hoxc8 and Hoxd4 results in severe cartilage 
defects, reduced proteoglycan content, accumulation of immature chondrocytes, and
decreased maturation to hypertrophy. We have also shown that Hoxd4 transgenic
mice whose diets were supplemented with folate had their skeletal development
restored. Since folate is required for growth and differentiation of
chondrocytes, we hypothesized that the beneficial effect of folate in Hoxd4
transgenic mice might indicate a local deficiency in folate utilization, possibly
caused by deregulation of genes encoding folate transport proteins or folate
metabolic enzymes.
METHODS: We assayed the prevalence of transcripts for 22 folate transport
proteins and metabolizing enzymes, here collectively referred to as folate
pathway genes. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on cDNA samples derived
from RNA isolated from primary chondrocytes of individual rib cartilages from
Hoxd4 and Hoxc8 transgenic mice, respectively.
RESULTS: This study shows that the Hox transgenes produce overexpression of Hoxd4
and Hoxc8 in primary chondrocytes from perinatal transgenic mice. However, no
differences were found in expression levels of the folate pathway genes in
transgenic cells compared to littermate controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that folate pathway genes are only
indirect targets of Hox transgene overexpression in our transgenic animals. These
expression studies provide a baseline for future studies into the role of folate 
metabolism in chondrocyte differentiation.

Combined deficiencies of Msx1 and Msx2 cause impaired patterning and survival of 
the cranial neural crest.

Angeles, CA 90089, USA.

The neural crest is a multipotent, migratory cell population that contributes to 
a variety of tissues and organs during vertebrate embryogenesis. Here, we focus
on the function of Msx1 and Msx2, homeobox genes implicated in several disorders 
affecting craniofacial development in humans. We show that Msx1/2 mutants exhibit
profound deficiencies in the development of structures derived from the cranial
and cardiac neural crest. These include hypoplastic and mispatterned cranial
ganglia, dysmorphogenesis of pharyngeal arch derivatives and abnormal
organization of conotruncal structures in the developing heart. The expression of
the neural crest markers Ap-2alpha, Sox10 and cadherin 6 (cdh6) in Msx1/2 mutants
revealed an apparent retardation in the migration of subpopulations of preotic
and postotic neural crest cells, and a disorganization of neural crest cells
paralleling patterning defects in cranial nerves. In addition, normally distinct 
subpopulations of migrating crest underwent mixing. The expression of the
hindbrain markers Krox20 and Epha4 was altered in Msx1/2 mutants, suggesting that
defects in neural crest populations may result, in part, from defects in
rhombomere identity. Msx1/2 mutants also exhibited increased Bmp4 expression in
migratory cranial neural crest and pharyngeal arches. Finally, proliferation of
neural crest-derived mesenchyme was unchanged, but the number of apoptotic cells 
was increased substantially in neural crest-derived cells that contribute to the 
cranial ganglia and the first pharyngeal arch. This increase in apoptosis may
contribute to the mispatterning of the cranial ganglia and the hypoplasia of the 
first arch.

lymphoid malignancies: identification of a novel germline mutation of HOXD4
leading to a partial loss-of-function.

The molecular basis of susceptibility to childhood malignant hemopathy remains
largely unknown. An excess of skeletal congenital anomalies has been reported
among children with hematological malignancy and points towards involvement of
developmental genes, like those belonging to the HOX gene family. In addition to 
their role in embryogenesis, HOX transcription factors are known to be regulators
of proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. We aimed to explore 
the possibility that germline alterations of HOX genes might be involved in
childhood acute lymphoid malignancies. A cohort of 86 children diagnosed with
acute lymphoid malignancy was studied, 20 of them concurrently presenting a
congenital anomaly of the skeleton. First, we screened for nucleotide changes
throughout the HOX genes of paralogous groups 4 to 13 in the 20 patients with
skeletal defects, following a skeletal phenotype-based strategy. Subsequently, we
extended the HOX mutation screening to the other 66 children having a malignant
lymphoproliferative disorder, but without skeletal defects. In total, 16 germline
mutations were identified. While 13 changes were also observed in healthy
controls, three variants were exclusively found in acute lymphoid malignancy
cases. These comprised the germline c.242A>T (p.Glu81Val) missense mutation of
HOXD4, detected in two children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL). Furthermore, this mutation was found in association with other specific
HOX variants of cluster D (2q31-q37), defining a unique haplotype. Functional
analysis of the murine Hoxd4 homolog revealed that mutant Hoxd4 protein had lower
transcriptional activity than wild-type protein in vitro. The p.Glu81Val mutation
of HOXD4 thus results in a partial loss-of-function, which might be involved in
childhood ALL.

During anteroposterior (AP) patterning of the developing hindbrain, the
expression borders of many transcription factors are aligned at interfaces
between neural segments called rhombomeres (r). Mechanisms regulating segmental
expression have been identified for Hox genes, but for other classes of AP
patterning genes there is only limited information. We have analysed the murine
retinoic acid receptor beta gene (Rarb) and show that it is induced prior to
segmentation, by retinoic-acid (RA) signalling from the mesoderm. Induction
establishes a diffuse expression border that regresses until, at later stages, it
is stably maintained at the r6/r7 boundary by inputs from Hoxb4 and Hoxd4.
Separate RA- and Hox-responsive enhancers mediate the two phases of Rarb
expression: a regulatory mechanism remarkably similar to that of Hoxb4. By
showing that Rarb is a direct transcriptional target of Hoxb4, this study
identifies a new molecular link, completing a feedback circuit between Rarb,
Hoxb4 and Hoxd4. We propose that the function of this circuit is to align the
initially incongruent expression of multiple RA-induced genes at a single segment
boundary.

Hox genes are differentially expressed along the embryonic anteroposterior axis. 
We used chromatin immunoprecipitation to detect chromatin changes at the Hoxd4
locus during neurogenesis in P19 cells and embryonic day 8.0 (E8.0) and E10.5
mouse embryos. During Hoxd4 induction in both systems, we observed that histone
modifications typical of transcriptionally active chromatin occurred first at the
3' neural enhancer and then at the promoter. Moreover, the sequential
distribution of histone modifications between E8.0 and E10.5 was consistent with 
a spreading of open chromatin, starting with the enhancer, followed by
successively more 5' intervening sequences, and culminating at the promoter.
Neither RNA polymerase II (Pol II) nor CBP associated with the inactive gene.
During Hoxd4 induction, CBP and RNA Pol II were recruited first to the enhancer
and then to the promoter. Whereas the CBP association was transient, RNA Pol II
remained associated with both regulatory regions. Histone modification and
transcription factor recruitment occurred in posterior, Hox-expressing embryonic 
tissues, but never in anterior tissues, where such genes are inactive. Together, 
our observations demonstrate that the direction of histone modifications at Hoxd4
mirrors colinear gene activation across Hox clusters and that the establishment
of anterior and posterior compartments is accompanied by the imposition of
distinct chromatin states.

Folate modulates Hox gene-controlled skeletal phenotypes.

Hox genes are well-known regulators of pattern formation and cell differentiation
in the developing vertebrate skeleton. Although skeletal variations are not
uncommon in humans few mutations in human HOX genes have been described. If such 
mutations are compatible with life, there may be physiological modifiers for the 
manifestation of Hox gene-controlled phenotypes, masking underlying mutations.
Here we present evidence that the essential nutrient folate modulates genetically
induced skeletal defects in Hoxd4 transgenic mice. We also show that chondrocytes
require folate for growth and differentiation and that they express folate
transport genes, providing evidence for a direct effect of folate on skeletal
cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report of nutritional influence on Hox
gene-controlled phenotypes, and implicates gene-environment interactions as
important modifiers of Hox gene function. Taken together, our results demonstrate
a beneficial effect of folate on skeletal development that may also be relevant
to disorders and variations of the human skeleton.

Identification of a Hoxd10-regulated transcriptional network and combinatorial
interactions with Hoxa10 during spinal cord development.

Hedlund E(1), Karsten SL, Kudo L, Geschwind DH, Carpenter EM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Psychiatry, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los
Angeles, California, USA.

Hoxd10 is expressed in the posterior spinal cord and hindlimbs of the mouse.
Hoxd10, along with other Hox transcription factors, is thought to regulate the
activity of genes involved in nervous system patterning and motor neuron
development, but little is known about the downstream targets regulated by this
gene. cDNA microarrays were used to investigate the transcriptional network
regulated by Hoxd10 in homozygous knockout animals. Sixty-nine genes were
identified with altered expression levels in mutant spinal cords. Among these
were genes involved in such diverse cellular events as cellular communication,
cell cycle control, development and differentiation, and neuronal survival. The
expression of some of these genes was investigated using reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization. Nine 
genes showed changes in expression of the same sign and similar magnitude using
RT-PCR in Hoxd10 single mutant animals, with additional changes in expression
seen in Hoxa10/Hoxd10 double mutant animals. In situ hybridization studies also
demonstrated changes in expression consistent with microarray results. Analysis
of putative promoter regions for Hox protein binding sites suggested that some
genes may be direct Hoxd10 targets, whereas others likely are regulated through
intermediate steps. Using cDNA microarrays to study a single gene knockout during
critical developmental stages has identified a large number of genes regulated by
Hoxd10, many of which would not have been approached as candidates for Hox gene
regulation based on function or expression.

HOXC and HOXD gene expression in human endometrium: lack of redundancy with HOXA 
paralogs.

Akbas GE(1), Taylor HS.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Yale University School of Medicine,
New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA.

HOXA genes, essential regulators of differentiation in the embryo, are also
essential for adult cyclic endometrial development and for endometrial
receptivity. Mice deficient in Hoxa10 or Hoxa11 exhibit reduced fertility because
of defects in implantation. We hypothesized that HOXC10, HOXC11, HOXD10, and
HOXD11, paralogs of HOXA10 and HOXA11, might also be involved in endometrial
development. Here, we showed that the expression of HOXC10, HOXC11, HOXD10, and
HOXD11 was evident throughout the menstrual cycle in the endometrium by
semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In the
secretory phase, expression of HOXC10, HOXC11, and HOXD11 decreased to 4% and
HOXD10 decreased to 25% of the proliferative phase expression (P < 0.001, P <
0.001, P < 0.02, P < 0.01, respectively). In situ hybridization demonstrated
expression of each of these HOX genes primarily in the stroma and confirmed the
decreased expression in the secretory phase. HOXC10, HOXC11, HOXD10, and HOXD11
expression was not regulated by sex steroids in primary endometrial stromal cells
or Ishikawa cells. The expression and regulation of HOXC and HOXD genes varies
from that of HOXA10 and HOXA11. Whereas HOXA10 and HOXA11 are regulators of
endometrial differentiation, HOXC and HOXD genes likely regulate endometrial
proliferation. Paralogous HOX genes typically have a redundant function in
development; a novel evolutionary divergence of paralogous Hox genes has resulted
in HOXC and HOXD genes having distinct expression patterns, regulation, and
likely also distinct functions from HOXA genes. A network of HOX genes may be
involved in regulating multiple aspects of endometrial development, including
both proliferation and differentiation.

Hoxa10 and Hoxd10 coordinately regulate lumbar motor neuron patterning.

Lin AW(1), Carpenter EM.

Author information: 
(1)Mental Retardation Research Center, Department of Psychiatry, UCLA School of
Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90024, USA.

The paralogous Hox genes Hoxa10 and Hoxd10 are expressed in overlapping domains
in the developing lumbar spinal cord and surrounding mesoderm. Independent
inactivation of these two genes alters the trajectory of spinal nerves and
decreases the complement of motor neurons present in the lumbar spinal cord,
whereas dual inactivation of these two genes has been shown to alter peripheral
nerve growth and development in the mouse hindlimb. We have examined the
organization and distribution of lumbar motor neurons in the spinal cords of
Hoxa10/Hoxd10 double mutant animals. Double mutant animals have decreased numbers
of lumbar motor neurons in both the medial and lateral motor columns. The
anteroposterior position of the lumbar motor column is shifted caudally in double
mutant animals, and the distribution of motor neurons is altered across
individual spinal segments. Distinctions between classes of motor neurons based
on positional specificity appear disrupted in double mutants. Double mutants also
demonstrate abnormal spinal cord vasculature and altered kidney placement and
size. Our observations suggest that Hoxa10 and Hoxd10 activity is required to
specify the position of the lumbar motor column and to provide segmental
specification and identity for the lumbar motor neurons.

Patterning of motor neurons by retinoic acid in the chick embryo hindbrain in
vitro.

College, Guy's Campus, London SE1 1UL, UK. sarah.guthrie@kcl.ac.uk

Motor neurons are found throughout the developing chick hindbrain, while somatic 
motor (SM) neurons develop only in rhombomeres 5 to 8 (r5-8), and in r1. In r2-8 
neuroepithelial explants from stage 7-10 embryos cultured in collagen gels, we
found that motor neurons were generated throughout r2-8, while SM neuron
differentiation was restricted to r5-8, as in vivo. Exposure of such explants to 
retinoic acid (RA) resulted in SM neuron differentiation throughout r2-8, while
inclusion of the mesoderm and endoderm suppressed this effect. In explants with
mesoderm/endoderm, RA-dependent SM neuron differentiation in rostral rhombomeres 
was restored by the application of an inhibitor of the RA-degrading enzyme CYP26.
We found that the mesoderm/endoderm (either with or without RA) induced Cyp26
expression in the neuroepithelium in vitro, suggesting that the modulatory effect
of CYP26 on RA-dependent patterning might be dependent on local signals.

Somatic motoneurone specification in the hindbrain: the influence of
somite-derived signals, retinoic acid and Hoxa3.

College, Guy's Campus, London SE1 1UL, UK.

We have investigated the mechanisms involved in generating hindbrain motoneurone 
subtypes, focusing on somatic motoneurones, which are confined to the caudal
hindbrain within rhombomeres 5-8. Following heterotopic transplantation of
rhombomeres along the rostrocaudal axis at various developmental stages, we have 
found that the capacity of rhombomeres to generate somatic motoneurones is labile
at the neural plate stage but becomes fixed just after neural tube closure, at
stage 10-11. Grafting of somites or retinoic acid-loaded beads beneath the
rostral hindbrain induced the formation of somatic motoneurones in rhombomere 4
only, and Hox genes normally expressed more caudally (Hoxa3, Hoxd4) were induced 
in this region. Targeted overexpression of Hoxa3 in the rostral hindbrain led to 
the generation of ectopic somatic motoneurones in ventral rhombomeres 1-4, and
was accompanied by the repression of the dorsoventral patterning gene Irx3. Taken
together, these observations suggest that the somites, retinoic acid and Hox
genes play a role in patterning somatic motoneurones in vivo.

Defects in cervical vertebrae in boric acid-exposed rat embryos are associated
with anterior shifts of hox gene expression domains.

Wéry N(1), Narotsky MG, Pacico N, Kavlock RJ, Picard JJ, Gofflot F.

Author information: 
(1)Unit of Developmental Genetics, Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels,
Belgium.

BACKGROUND: Previously, we showed that prenatal exposure to boric acid (BA), an
industrial agent with large production, causes alterations of the axial skeleton 
in rat embryos, reminiscent of homeotic transformations. Indeed, Sprague-Dawley
rats exposed in utero to BA on gestation day 9 (GD 9) had only six, rather than
the normal seven, cervical vertebrae. This finding, observed in 91% of GD 21
fetuses, suggests posterior transformations of vertebrae. The present study
attempts to determine if these skeletal alterations could be explained by
modifications of the hox code, involved in the establishment of positional
information along the craniocaudal axis of the embryo.
METHODS: Pregnant rats were treated by gavage with BA (500 mg/kg, twice) on GD 9.
Embryos were collected on GD 11 or GD 13.5 and processed for in situ
hybridization. Several hox genes were selected according to the position of their
cranial limit of expression in the cervical and thoracic region.
RESULTS: At GD 13.5, we detected a cranial shift of the anterior limit of
expression of hoxc6 and hoxa6. We observed no difference between control and
treated embryos in the location of the cranial limit of expression of the other
genes: hoxd4, hoxa4, hoxc5, and hoxa5.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that following in utero exposure to BA on GD
9, a disturbance of the expression of hox genes involved inthe specification of
most anterior vertebrae is observed at GD 13.5. Based on their expression domain 
and on their implication in the definition of the cervicothoracic vertebral
boundary, it is likely that the anteriorization of hoxc6 and hoxa6 reported here 
is correlated to the morphological phenotype observed in BA-exposed fetuses at GD
21.

The role of a retinoic acid response element in establishing the anterior neural 
expression border of Hoxd4 transgenes.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

The zebrafish hoxd4a locus was compared to its murine ortholog, Hoxd4. The
sequence of regulatory elements, including a DR5 type retinoic acid response
element (RARE) required for Hoxd4 neural enhancer activity, are highly conserved.
Additionally, zebrafish and mouse neural enhancers function identically in
transgenic mouse embryos. We tested whether sequence conservation reflects
functional importance by altering the spacing and sequence of the RARE in the
Hoxd4 neural enhancer. Stabilizing receptor-DNA interactions did not anteriorize 
transgene expression. By contrast, conversion of the RARE from a DR5 to a DR2
type element decreased receptor-DNA stability and posteriorized expression.
Hence, the setting of the Hox anterior expression border is not a simple function
of the affinity of retinoid receptors for their cognate element.

LIN-39/Hox triggers cell division and represses EFF-1/fusogen-dependent vulval
cell fusion.

Shemer G(1), Podbilewicz B.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, 32000, 
Israel.

General mechanisms by which Hox genes establish cell fates are known. However, a 
few Hox effectors mediating cell behaviors have been identified. Here we found
the first effector of LIN-39/HoxD4/Dfd in Caenorhabditis elegans. In specific
vulval precursor cells (VPCs), LIN-39 represses early and late expression of
EFF-1, a membrane protein essential for cell fusion. Repression of eff-1 is also 
achieved by the activity of CEH-20/Exd/Pbx, a known cofactor of Hox proteins.
Unfused VPCs in lin-39(-);eff-1(-) double mutants fail to divide but migrate,
executing vulval fates. Thus, lin-39 is essential for inhibition of
EFF-1-dependent cell fusion and stimulation of cell proliferation during vulva
formation. Supplemental material is available at http://www.genesdev.org.

Chromosomal translocation t(9;11)(p22;q23) in acute myeloid leukemia fuses the
MLL and AF9 genes. We have inactivated the murine homologue of AF9 to elucidate
its normal role. No effect on hematopoiesis was observed in mice with a null
mutation of Af9. However, an Af9 null mutation caused perinatal lethality, and
homozygous mice exhibited anomalies of the axial skeleton. Both the cervical and 
thoracic regions were affected by anterior homeotic transformation. Strikingly,
mice lacking functional Af9 exhibited a grossly deformed atlas and an extra
cervical vertebra. To determine the molecular mediators of this phenotype,
analysis of Hox gene expression by in situ hybridization showed that Af9 null
embryos have posterior changes in Hoxd4 gene expression. We conclude that the Af9
gene is required for normal embryogenesis in mice by controlling pattern
formation, apparently via control of Hox gene regulation. This is analogous to
the role of Mll, the murine homolog of human MLL, to which the Af9 gene fuses in 
acute myeloid leukemias.

To determine the role of Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling in murine
limb development in vivo, the keratin 14 promoter was used to drive expression of
the BMP antagonist Noggin in transgenic mice. Phosphorylation and nuclear
translocation of Smad1/5 were dramatically reduced in limbs of the transgenic
animals, confirming the inhibition of BMP signaling. These mice developed
extensive limb soft tissue syndactyly and postaxial polydactyly. Apoptosis in the
developing limb necrotic zones was reduced with incomplete regression of the
interdigital tissue. The postaxial extra digit is also consistent with a role for
BMPs in regulating apoptosis. Furthermore, there was persistent expression of
Fgf8, suggesting a delay in the regression of the AER. However, Msx1 and Msx2
expression was unchanged in these transgenic mice, implying that induction of
these genes is not essential for mediating BMP-induced interdigital apoptosis in 
mice. These abnormalities were rescued by coexpressing BMP4 under the same
promoter in double transgenic mice, suggesting that the limb abnormalities are a 
direct effect of inhibiting BMP signaling.

Duplication of the Hoxd11 gene causes alterations in the axial and appendicular
skeleton of the mouse.

Boulet AM(1), Capecchi MR.

Author information: 
(1)Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Human Genetics, University of
Utah, School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah 84112-5331, USA.

The Hox genes encode a group of transcription factors essential for proper
development of the mouse. Targeted mutation of the Hoxd11 gene causes reduced
male fertility, vertebral transformation, carpal bone fusions, and reductions in 
digit length. A duplication of the Hoxd11 gene was created with the expectation
that the consequences of restricted overexpression in the appropriate cells would
provide further insight into the function of the Hoxd11 gene product. Genetic
assays demonstrated that two tandem copies of Hoxd11 were functionally
indistinguishable from the normal two copies of the gene on separate chromosomes 
with respect to formation of the axial and appendicular skeleton. Extra copies of
Hoxd11 caused an increase in the lengths of some bones of the forelimb autopod
and a decrease in the number of lumbar vertebrae. Further, analysis of the Hoxd11
duplication demonstrated that the Hoxd11 protein can perform some functions
supplied by its paralogue Hoxa11. For example, the defects in forelimb bones are 
corrected when extra copies of Hoxd11 are present in the Hoxa11 homozygous mutant
background. Thus, it appears that Hoxd11 can quantitatively compensate for the
absence of Hoxa11 protein, and therefore Hoxa11 and Hoxd11 are functionally
equivalent in the zeugopod. However, extra copies of Hoxd11 did not improve male 
or female fertility in Hoxa11 mutants. Interestingly, the insertion of an
additional Hoxd11 locus into the HoxD complex does not appear to affect the
expression patterns of the neighboring Hoxd10, -d12, or -d13 genes.

The homeobox-containing gene family plays a pivotal role in regulating,
patterning, and axial morphogenesis in the developing embryo. But there is still 
very little known about the expression and function of these genes in mammalian
oocytes and preimplantation stage embryos. In this study we have used degenerate 
primers corresponding to the highly conserved regions of Antennapedia class
homeodomains as a rapid and an efficient method to survey bovine cDNA libraries
derived from unfertilised oocytes, single 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, morula, and
blastocyst stage embryos for the presence of homeobox sequences. Our results
provide, for the first time, evidence for the transcription of Hoxa3 and Hoxd1 in
oocytes; Cdx1 and Cdx2 in the 2-cell; Cdx1, Hoxa1, Hoxd1, and Hoxd4 in the
4-cell; Cdx1, Hoxa1, and Hoxc9 in the 8-cell; Cdx2, Hoxb9, and Hoxc9 in the
morula; Cdx2, Hoxb7, Hoxb9, and Hoxc9 in blastocyst stage cattle embryos. These
are candidate genes for the developmental capacity of in vivo and in vitro
produced bovine embryos.

The ancestral role of the Hox gene family is specifying morphogenetic differences
along the main body axis. In vertebrates, HoxD genes were also co-opted along
with the emergence of novel structures such as limbs and genitalia. We propose
that these functional recruitments relied on the appearance, or implementation,
of regulatory sequences outside of the complex. Whereas transgenic human and
murine HOXD clusters could function during axial patterning, in mice they were
not expressed outside the trunk. Accordingly, deletion of the entire cluster
abolished axial expression, whereas recently acquired regulatory controls were
preserved.

Strasbourg, France.

Mutants mice carrying targeted inactivations of both retinoic acid receptor (RAR)
alpha and RAR gamma (A alpha/A gamma mutants) were analyzed at different
embryonic stages, in order to establish the timing of appearance of defects that 
we previously observed during the fetal period. We show that embryonic day (E)9.5
A alpha/A gamma embryos display severe malformations, similar to those already
described in retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 null mutants. These malformations
reflect early roles of retinoic acid signaling in axial rotation, segmentation
and closure of the hindbrain; formation of otocysts, pharyngeal arches and
forelimb buds; and in the closure of the primitive gut. The hindbrain of E8.5 A
alpha/A gamma embryos shows a posterior expansion of rhombomere 3 and 4 (R3 and
R4) markers, but fails to express kreisler, a normal marker of R5 and R6. This
abnormal hindbrain phenotype is strikingly different from that of embryos lacking
RAR alpha and RAR beta (A alpha/A beta mutants), in which we have previously
shown that the territory corresponding to R5 and R6 is markedly enlarged.
Administration of a pan-RAR antagonist at E8.0 to wild-type embryos cultured in
vitro results in an A alpha/A beta-like hindbrain phenotype, whereas an earlier
treatment at E7.0 yields an A alpha/A gamma-like phenotype. Altogether, our data 
suggest that RAR alpha and/or RAR gamma transduce the RA signal that is required 
first to specify the prospective R5/R6 territory, whereas RAR beta is
subsequently involved in setting up the caudal boundary of this territory.

The paralogous Hox genes Hoxa10 and Hoxd10 interact to pattern the mouse hindlimb
peripheral nervous system and skeleton.

Sciences, UCLA School of Medicine, 760 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, California

The most 5' mouse Hoxa and Hoxd genes, which occupy positions 9-13 and which are 
related to the Drosophila AbdB gene, are all active in patterning developing
limbs. Inactivation of individual genes produces alterations in skeletal elements
of both forelimb and hindlimb; inactivation of some of these genes also alters
hindlimb innervation. Simultaneous inactivation of paralogous or nonparalogous
Hoxa and Hoxd genes produces more widespread alterations, suggesting that
combinatorial interactions between these genes are required for proper limb
patterning. We have examined the effects of simultaneous inactivation of Hoxa10
and Hoxd10 on mouse hindlimb skeletal and nervous system development. These
paralogous genes are expressed at lumbar and sacral levels of the developing
neural tube and surrounding axial mesoderm as well as in developing forelimb and 
hindlimb buds. Double-mutant animals demonstrated impaired locomotor behavior and
altered development of posterior vertebrae and hindlimb skeletal elements.
Alterations in hindlimb innervation were also observed, including truncations and
deletions of the tibial and peroneal nerves. Animals carrying fewer mutant
alleles show similar, but less extreme phenotypes. These observations suggest
that Hoxa10 and Hoxd10 coordinately regulate skeletal development and innervation
of the hindlimb.

DiSSiMiL: Diverse Small Size Mini-Libraries applied to simple and rapid epitope
mapping of a monoclonal antibody.

Methods for screening protein-protein interactions are useful in protein science 
and for the generation of drug leads. We set out to develop a simplified assay to
rapidly test protein-protein interactions, with a library of 400 pentapeptides
comprising the 20 natural amino acids at two variable positions followed by three
glycines (NH2-X1X2GGG). The library was used to identify the epitope of
monoclonal antibody (mAb) 10D11 directed against the HOXD4 protein. Three
pentapeptide 'hits' were selected (VYGGG, PWGGG and WKGGG) from direct binding
assays screening for pentapeptide-mAb interactions; and from assays using
pentapeptides in solution to competitively block HOXD4-mAb interactions.
Alignment of the three 'hit' pentapeptides to the HOXD4 sequence predicts the mAb
10D11 epitope as NH2-VYPWMK. Synthesis of NH2-VYPWMK hexapeptide confirmed this
prediction; and an alanine scan of HOXD4 ablated binding by mAb 10D11 when amino 
acids in the putative epitope were mutated. We propose that these simplified but 
diverse libraries can be used for rapid epitope mapping of some mAbs, and for
generating lead small peptide analogs that interfere with receptor-ligand or
other protein-protein interactions, or with enzymatic activity.

Vitamin A deficiency results in the dose-dependent acquisition of anterior
character and shortening of the caudal hindbrain of the rat embryo.

The developing nervous system is particularly vulnerable to vitamin A deficiency.
Retinoid has been proposed to be a posteriorizing factor during hindbrain
development, although direct evidence in the mammalian embryo is lacking. In the 
present study, pregnant vitamin A-deficient (VAD) rats were fed purified diets
containing varying levels of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA; 0, 0.5, 1.5, 6, 12,
25, 50, 125, or 250 microg/g diet) or were supplemented with retinol. Hindbrain
development was studied from embryonic day 10 to 12.5 ( approximately 6 to 40
somites). Normal morphogenesis was observed in all embryos from groups fed 250
microg atRA/g diet or retinol. The most caudal region of the hindbrain was the
most sensitive to retinoid insufficiency, as evidenced by a loss of the
hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII) in embryos from the 125 microg atRA/g diet 
group. Further reduction of atRA to 50 microg/g diet led to the loss of cranial
nerves IX, X, XI, and XII and associated sensory ganglia IX and X in all embryos 
as well as the loss of hindbrain segmentation caudal to the rhombomere (r) 3/4
border in a subset of embryos. Dysmorphic orthotopic otic vesicles or immature
otic-like vesicles in both orthotopic and caudally ectopic locations were also
observed. As the level of atRA was reduced, a loss of caudal hindbrain
segmentation was observed in all embryos and the incidence of otic vesicle
abnormalities increased. Perturbations in hindbrain segmentation, cranial nerve
formation, and otic vesicle development were associated with abnormal patterning 
of the posterior hindbrain. Embryos from VAD dams fed between 0.5 and 50 microg
atRA/g diet exhibited Hoxb-1 protein expression along the entire neural tube
caudal to the r3/r4 border at a time when it should be restricted to r4. Krox-20 
protein expression was expanded in r3 but absent or reduced in presumptive r5.
Hoxd-4 mRNA expression was absent in the posterior hindbrain, and the rostral
limit of Hoxb-5 protein expression in the neural tube was anteriorized,
suggesting that the most posterior hindbrain region (r7/r8) had been deleted
and/or improperly patterned. Thus, when limiting amounts of atRA are provided to 
VAD dams, the caudal portion of the hindbrain is shortened and possesses
r4/r5-like characteristics, with this region finally exhibiting r4-like gene
expression when retinoid is restricted even more severely. Thus, regions of the
anterior hindbrain (i.e., r3 and r4) appear to be greatly expanded, whereas the
posterior hindbrain (r5-r8) is reduced or absent. This work shows that retinoid
plays a critical role in patterning, segmentation, and neurogenesis of the caudal
hindbrain and serves as an essential posteriorizing signal for this region of the
central nervous system in the mammal.

Loss- and gain-of-function mutations show a polycomb group function for Ring1A in
mice.

The products of the Polycomb group (PcG) of genes act as transcriptional
repressors involved in the maintenance of homeotic gene expression patterns
throughout development, from flies to mice. Biochemical and molecular evidence
suggests that the mouse Ring1A gene is a member of the PcG of genes. However,
genetic evidence is needed to establish PcG function for Ring1A, since contrary
to all other murine PcG genes, there is no known Drosophila PcG gene encoding a
homolog of the Ring1A protein. To study Ring1A function we have generated a mouse
line lacking Ring1A and mouse lines overexpressing Ring1A. Both Ring1A(-/-)and
Ring1A(+/-) mice show anterior transformations and other abnormalities of the
axial skeleton, which indicates an unusual sensitivity of axial skeleton
patterning to Ring1A gene dosage. Ectopic expression of Ring1A also results in
dose-dependent anterior transformations of vertebral identity, many of which,
interestingly, are shared by Ring1A(-/-) mice. In contrast, the alterations of
Hox gene expression observed in both type of mutant mice are subtle and involve a
reduced number of Hox genes. Taken together, these results provide genetic
evidence for a PcG function of the mouse Ring1A gene.

Cell signaling switches HOX-PBX complexes from repressors to activators of
transcription mediated by histone deacetylases and histone acetyltransferases.

Saleh M(1), Rambaldi I, Yang XJ, Featherstone MS.

Author information: 
(1)McGill Cancer Centre, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada H3G 1Y6.

The Hoxb1 autoregulatory element comprises three HOX-PBX binding sites. Despite
the presence of HOXB1 and PBX1, this enhancer fails to activate reporter gene
expression in retinoic acid-treated P19 cell monolayers. Activation requires cell
aggregation in addition to RA. This suggests that HOX-PBX complexes may repress
transcription under some conditions. Consistent with this, multimerized HOX-PBX
binding sites repress reporter gene expression in HEK293 cells. We provide a
mechanistic basis for repressor function by demonstrating that a corepressor
complex, including histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1 and 3, mSIN3B, and N-CoR/SMRT, 
interacts with PBX1A. We map a site of interaction with HDAC1 to the PBX1 N
terminus and show that the PBX partner is required for repression by the HOX-PBX 
complex. Treatment with the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A not only
relieves repression but also converts the HOX-PBX complex to a net activator of
transcription. We show that this activation function is mediated by the
recruitment of the coactivator CREB-binding protein by the HOX partner.
Interestingly, HOX-PBX complexes are switched from transcriptional repressors to 
activators in response to protein kinase A signaling or cell aggregation.
Together, our results suggest a model whereby the HOX-PBX complex can act as a
repressor or activator of transcription via association with corepressors and
coactivators. The model implies that cell signaling is a direct determinant of
HOX-PBX function in the patterning of the animal embryo.

Murine hoxd4 expression in the CNS requires multiple elements including a
retinoic acid response element.

Author information:

Québec H3G 1Y6, Montréal, Canada.

We have identified a retinoic acid response element (RARE) within a neural
enhancer located 3' to the Hoxd4 gene. This RARE is required for the initiation
and maintenance of Hoxd4 transgene expression in neurectoderm, and for full
anteriorized expression upon retinoic acid (RA) treatment. Mutations within the
sequence TTTTCTG, located 2 bp downstream of the RARE, posteriorized transgene
activity. However, the onset of transgene expression and its response to RA were 
indistinguishable from wild type. While the TTTTCTG motif resembles a CDX binding
site, human CDX1 protein did not interact with this element in vitro. Three
additional regions were also shown to control transgene expression in
neurectoderm, establishing that multiple elements constitute the Hoxd4 neural
enhancer.

The Polycomb group genes are required for the correct expression of the homeotic 
complex genes and segment specification during Drosophila embryogenesis and
larval development. In mouse, inactivation studies of several Polycomb group
genes indicate that they are also involved in Hox gene regulation. We have used
our previously generated M33 mutants to study the function of M33, the mouse
homologue of the Polycomb gene of Drosophila. In this paper, we show that in the 
absence of M33, the window of Hoxd4 retinoic acid (RA) responsiveness is opened
earlier and that Hoxd11 gene expression is activated earlier in development This 
indicates that M33 antagonizes the RA pathway and has a function in the
establishment of the early temporal sequence of activation of Hox genes. Despite 
the early activation, A-P boundaries are correct in later stages, indicating a
separate control mechanism for early aspects of Hox regulation. This raises a
number of interesting issues with respect to the roles of both Pc-G proteins and 
Hox regulatory mechanisms. We propose that a function of the M33 protein is to
control the accessibility of retinoic acid response elements in the vicinity of
Hox genes regulatory regions by direct or indirect mechanisms or both. This could
provide a means for preventing ectopic transactivation early in development and
be part of the molecular basis for temporal colinearity of Hox gene expression.

Understanding why metazoan Hox/HOM-C genes are expressed in spatiotemporal
sequences showing colinearity with their genomic sequence is a central challenge 
in developmental biology. Here, we studied the consequences of ectopically
expressing Hox genes to investigate whether Hox-Hox interactions might help to
order gene expression during very early vertebrate embryogenesis. Our study
revealed conserved autoregulatory loops for the Hox4 and Hox7 paralogue groups,
detected following ectopic expression Hoxb-4 or HOXD4, and Hoxa-7, respectively. 
We also detected specific induction of 5' posterior Hox genes; Hoxb-5 to Hoxb-9, 
following ectopic expression of Hoxb-4/HOXD4; Hoxb-8 and Hoxb-9 following ectopic
expression of Hoxa-7. Additionally, we observed specific repression of 3'
anterior genes, following ectopic expression of Hox4 and Hox7 paralogues. We
found that induction of Hoxb-4 and Hoxb-5 by Hoxb-4 can be direct, whereas
induction of Hoxb-7 is indirect, suggesting the possibility of an activating
cascade. Finally, we found that activation of Hoxb-4 itself and of posterior Hox 
genes by Hoxb-4 can be both non-cell-autonomous, as well as direct. We believe
that our findings could be important for understanding how a highly ordered Hox
expression sequence is set up in the early vertebrate embryo.

Targeted disruption of Hoxd9 and Hoxd10 alters locomotor behavior, vertebral
identity, and peripheral nervous system development.

Medicine 90024, USA.

The five most 5' HoxD genes, which are related to the Drosophila Abd-B gene, play
an important role in patterning axial and appendicular skeletal elements and the 
nervous system of developing vertebrate embryos. Three of these genes, Hoxd11,
Hoxd12, and Hoxd13, act synergistically to pattern the hindlimb autopod. In this 
study, we examine the combined effects of two additional 5' HoxD genes, Hoxd9 and
Hoxd10. Both of these genes are expressed posteriorly in overlapping domains in
the developing neural tube and axial mesoderm as well as in developing limbs.
Locomotor behavior in animals carrying a double mutation in these two genes was
altered; these alterations included changes in gait, mobility, and adduction.
Morphological analysis showed alterations in axial and appendicular skeletal
structure, hindlimb peripheral nerve organization and projection, and distal
hindlimb musculature. These morphological alterations are likely to provide the
substrate for the observed alterations in locomotor behavior. The alterations
observed in double-mutant mice are distinct from the phenotypes observed in mice 
carrying single mutations in either gene, but exhibit most of the features of
both individual phenotypes. This suggests that the combined activity of two
adjacent Hox genes provides more patterning information than activity of each
gene alone. These observations support the idea that adjacent Hox genes with
overlapping expression patterns may interact functionally to provide patterning
information to the same regions of developing mouse embryos.

Coordinated expression of 3' hox genes during murine embryonal gut development:
an enteric Hox code.

Author information: 
(1)Gastroenterology Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London,
London, England. J.Pitera@ich.ucl.ac.uk

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hox genes are highly conserved developmental control genes
that may be organized and expressed in the form of a code required for correct
morphogenesis. Little is known about their control of the embryonal gut. However,
Hox paralogues 4 and 5, which are expressed at the sites of origin of vagal
neural crest cells and splanchnic mesoderm, are likely to be important. We have
studied the expression domains of these genes in the gut both spatially and
temporally.
METHODS: CD1 mice embryos of embryonic days E8.5-E17.5 were studied. The spatial 
and temporal expression patterns of messenger RNA of Hoxa4, b4, c4, d4, a5, c5,
and b5 homeoprotein were determined by in situ hybridization and
immunohistochemistry in whole embryos, whole gastrointestinal tracts, and
vibratome sections.
RESULTS: There were different spatial, temporal, and combinatorial expression
patterns in different morphological regions: foregut, prececal gut, cecum, and
postcecal gut. Two dynamic gradients, rostral and caudal, were coordinated with
nested expression domains along the gut primordium. Region-specific domains were 
present in the stomach and cecum.
CONCLUSIONS: The expression patterns of genes in paralogous groups 4 and 5
suggest that they are organized to form a specific enteric Hox code required for 
correct enteric development.

Hoxd4 and Rarg interact synergistically in the specification of the cervical
vertebrae.

Author information: 
(1)McGill Cancer Centre, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

We show that, relative to single null mutants, mice bearing mutations in both
Hoxd4 and Rarg display malformations of the basioccipital bone, and first (C1)
and second cervical vertebrae (C2) at increased penetrance and expressivity,
demonstrating synergy between Hoxd4 and Rarg in the specification of the cervical
skeleton. In contrast to Rarg mutants, retinoic acid (RA) treatment on embryonic 
day 10.5 of Hoxd4 single or Hoxd4;Rarg double mutants does not rescue normal
development of C2. Somitic expression of Hoxd4 is not altered in wild-type or
Rarg mutant animals before or after RA treatment on day 10.5, suggesting that
Hoxd4 and Rarg act in parallel to regulate the expression of target genes
directing skeletogenesis.

PBX and MEIS as non-DNA-binding partners in trimeric complexes with HOX proteins.

Author information: 
(1)McGill Cancer Centre, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3G 1Y6.

HOX, PBX, and MEIS transcription factors bind DNA through a homeodomain. PBX
proteins bind DNA cooperatively as heterodimers with MEIS family members and also
with HOX proteins from paralog groups 1 to 10. MEIS proteins cooperatively bind
DNA with ABD-B class HOX proteins of groups 9 and 10. Here, we examine aspects of
dimeric and higher-order interactions between these three homeodomain classes.
The most significant results can be summarized as follows. (i) Most of PBX N
terminal to the homeodomain is required for efficient cooperative binding with
HOXD4 and HOXD9. (ii) MEIS and PBX proteins form higher-order complexes on a
heterodimeric binding site. (iii) Although MEIS does not cooperatively bind DNA
with ANTP class HOX proteins, it does form a trimer as a non-DNA-binding partner 
with DNA-bound PBX-HOXD4. (iv) The N terminus of HOXD4 negatively regulates
trimer formation. (v) MEIS forms a similar trimer with DNA-bound PBX-HOXD9. (vi) 
A related trimer (where MEIS is a non-DNA-binding partner) is formed on a
transcriptional promoter within the cell. (vii) We observe an additional trimer
class involving non-DNA-bound PBX and DNA-bound MEIS-HOXD9 or MEIS-HOXD10
heterodimers that is enhanced by mutation of the PBX homeodomain. (viii) In this 
latter trimer, PBX is likely to contact both MEIS and HOXD9/D10. (ix) The
stability of DNA binding by all trimers is enhanced relative to the heterodimers.
These findings suggest novel functions for PBX and MEIS in modulating the
function of DNA-bound MEIS-HOX and PBX-HOX heterodimers, respectively.

Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is expressed in the posterior vertebrate limb bud mesenchyme
and directs anteroposterior patterning and growth during limb development. Here
we report an analysis of the pectoral fin phenotype of zebrafish sonic you
mutants, which disrupt the shh gene. We show that Shh is required for the
establishment of some aspects of anteroposterior polarity, while other aspects of
anteroposterior polarity are established independently of Shh, and only later
come to depend on Shh for their maintenance. We also demonstrate that Shh is
required for the activation of posterior HoxD genes by retinoic acid. Finally, we
show that Shh is required for normal development of the apical ectodermal fold,
for growth of the fin bud, and for formation of the fin endoskeleton.

RARbeta mediates the response of Hoxd4 and Hoxb4 to exogenous retinoic acid.

Author information: 
(1)McGill Cancer Centre, Department of Medicine, McGill University, Montréal,
Québec, Canada.

One action of retinoids in development is the regulation of Hox gene expression. 
Hoxd4 and Hoxb4 expression in the embryonic hindbrain is anteriorized by retinoic
acid (RA) treatment of mid-gestation mouse embryos. Here we demonstrate that
retinoic acid receptor beta (Rarb) deficient mice present only a partial
anteriorization of either Hoxd4 or Hoxb4 in response to RA treatment. Our results
strongly suggest that RARbeta is a mediator of their RA-response, and reveal
anteroposterior polarity within a single rhombomere (r). Additionally, we
generated mice doubly mutated for Hoxd4 and Rarb in an attempt to identify common
morphogenetic pathways between these two genes. We conclude that there are no
synergistic interactions between Hoxd4 and Rarb in the specification of the
cervical vertebrae.

Hox gene expression in limbs: colinearity by opposite regulatory controls.

Genes of the HoxD complex have a crucial role in the morphogenesis of vertebrate 
limbs. During development, their functional domains are colinear with their
genomic positions within the HoxD cluster such that Hoxd13 and Hoxd12 are
necessary for digit development, whereas Hoxd11 and Hoxd10 are involved in making
forearms. Mutational analyses of these genes have demonstrated their importance
and illustrated the requirement for a precise control of their expression during 
early limb morphogenesis. To study the nature of this control, we have scanned
the posterior part of the HoxD complex with a targeted reporter transgene and
analyzed the response of this foreign promoter to limb regulatory influences. The
results suggest that this regulation is achieved through the opposite effects of 
two enhancer elements which would compete with each other for interacting with
nearby-located promoters. The physical position of a given gene within this
genomic interval of opposite regulations might thus determine its final
expression pattern. This model provides a conceptual link between the morphology 
of the future limb and the genetic organization of the Hox gene cluster, a
translation of a genomic context into a morphogenetic topology.

Expression of the murine Hoxa4 gene requires both autoregulation and a conserved 
retinoic acid response element.

Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA.

Analysis of the regulatory regions of the Hox genes has revealed a complex array 
of positive and negative cis-acting elements that control the spatial and
temporal pattern of expression of these genes during embryogenesis. In this study
we show that normal expression of the murine Hoxa4 gene during development
requires both autoregulatory and retinoic acid-dependent modes of regulation.
When introduced into a Hoxa4 null background, expression of a lacZ reporter gene 
driven by the Hoxa4 regulatory region (Hoxa4/lacZ) is either abolished or
significantly reduced in all tissues at E10. 5-E12.5. Thus, the observed
autoregulation of the Drosophila Deformed gene is conserved in a mouse homolog in
vivo, and is reflected in a widespread requirement for positive feedback to
maintain Hoxa4 expression. We also identify three potential retinoic acid
response elements in the Hoxa4 5' flanking region, one of which is identical to a
well-characterized element flanking the Hoxd4 gene. Administration of retinoic
acid to Hoxa4/lacZ transgenic embryos resulted in stage-dependent ectopic
expression of the reporter gene in the neural tube and hindbrain. When
administered to Hoxa4 null embryos, however, persistent ectopic expression was
not observed, suggesting that autoregulation is required for maintenance of the
retinoic acid-induced expression. Finally, mutation of the consensus retinoic
acid response element eliminated the response of the reporter gene to exogenous
retinoic acid, and abolished all embryonic expression in untreated embryos, with 
the exception of the neural tube and prevertebrae. These data add to the evidence
that Hox gene expression is regulated, in part, by endogenous retinoids and
autoregulatory loops.

Targeted disruption of the Hoxd-10 gene, a 5' member of the mouse HoxD linkage
group, produces mice with hindlimb-specific defects in gait and adduction. To
determine the underlying causes of this locomotor defect, mutant mice were
examined for skeletal, muscular and neural abnormalities. Mutant mice exhibit
alterations in the vertebral column and in the bones of the hindlimb. Sacral
vertebrae beginning at the level of S2 exhibit homeotic transformations to adopt 
the morphology of the next most anterior vertebra. In the hindlimb, there is an
anterior shift in the position of the patella, an occasional production of an
anterior sesamoid bone, and an outward rotation of the lower part of the leg, all
of which contribute to the defects in locomotion. No major alterations in
hindlimb musculature were observed, but defects in the nervous system were
evident. There was a decrease in the number of spinal segments projecting nerve
fibers through the sacral plexus to innervate the musculature of the hindlimb.
Deletion of a hindlimb nerve was seen in some animals, and a shift was evident in
the position of the lumbar lateral motor column. These observations suggest a
role for the Hoxd-10 gene in establishing regional identity within the spinal
cord and imply that patterning of the spinal cord may have intrinsic components
and is not completely imposed by the surrounding mesoderm.

Characterization and retinoic acid responsiveness of the murine Hoxd4
transcription unit.

We have characterized the transcription unit of a murine Hox gene in the fourth
paralogous group, Hoxd4. We have identified two Hoxd4 transcription start sites
by S1 analysis. The upstream promoter (P2) is 5.2 kilobase pairs upstream from
the coding region, while the downstream promoter (P1) is 1.1 kilobase pairs
distant. Both promoters bear a cluster of start sites. Multiple transcripts were 
identified by Northern blot, originating from both promoters and multiple
polyadenylation signals. Expression of P1 transcripts in the neural tube shows an
anterior border at the rhombomere 6/7 boundary, corresponding to previous reports
(Gaunt, S. J., Krumlauf, R., and Duboule, D. (1989) Development 107, 131-141;
Morrison, A., Moroni, M. C., Ariza-McNaughton, L., Krumlauf, R., and Mavilio, F. 
(1996) Development 122, 1895-1907). A more posterior boundary in the central
nervous system was observed for P2 transcripts. We observed strong expression up 
to somite 6 and weak expression in somite 5, correlating with the phenotype of
Hoxd4 null mutant mice (Horan, G. S. B., Nagy Kovàcs, E., Behringer, R. R., and
Featherstone, M. S. (1995) Dev. Biol. 169, 359-372). In response to retinoic
acid, expression from P1 in the hindbrain was anteriorized after 4 or 24 h of
treatment. P2 transcripts seemed to be less responsive and/or to have an indirect
response to retinoic acid. The long 5'-untranslated region found in all Hoxd4
transcripts suggests that translation does not occur by a classical ribosome
scanning mechanism.

In this report, we show that a lacZ reporter spanning 12.5 kb of murine Hoxd4
genomic DNA contains the major regulatory elements controlling Hoxd4 expression
in the mouse embryo. Mutational analysis revealed multiple regulatory regions
both 5' and 3' to the coding region. These include a 3' enhancer region required 
for expression in the central nervous system (CNS) and setting the anterior
border in the paraxial mesoderm, and a 5' mesodermal enhancer that directs
expression in paraxial and lateral plate mesoderm. A previously defined retinoic 
acid response element (RARE) is a component of the 5' mesodermal enhancer. Our
results support a model in which retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and HOX proteins 
mediate the initiation and maintenance of Hoxd4 expression.

HOXD4 and regulation of the group 4 paralog genes.

Research, Mill Hill, London, UK.

From an evolutionary perspective, it is important to understand the degree of
conservation of cis-regulatory mechanisms between paralogous Hox genes. In this
study, we have used transgenic analysis of the human HOXD4 locus to identify one 
neural and two mesodermal 3' enhancers that are capable of mediating the proper
anterior limits of expression in the hindbrain and paraxial mesoderm (somites),
respectively. In addition to directing expression in the central nervous system
(CNS) up to the correct rhombomere 6/7 boundary in the hindbrain, the neural
enhancer also mediates a three rhombomere anterior shift from this boundary in
response to retinoic acid (RA), mimicking the endogenous Hoxd4 response. We have 
extended the transgenic analysis to Hoxa4 identifying mesodermal, neural and
retinoid responsive components in the 3' flanking region of that gene, which
reflect aspects of endogenous Hoxa4 expression. Comparative analysis of the
retinoid responses of Hoxd4, Hoxa4 and Hoxb4 reveals that, while they can be
rapidly induced by RA, there is a window of competence for this response, which
is different to that of more 3' Hox genes. Mesodermal regulation involves
multiple regions with overlapping or related activity and is complex, but with
respect to neural regulation and response to RA, Hoxb4 and Hoxd4 appear to be
more closely related to each other than Hoxa4. These results illustrate that much
of the general positioning of 5' and 3' flanking regulatory regions has been
conserved between three of the group 4 paralogs during vertebrate evolution,
which most likely reflects the original positioning of regulatory regions in the 
ancestral Hox complex.

Residues flanking the HOX YPWM motif contribute to cooperative interactions with 
PBX.

Shanmugam K(1), Featherstone MS, Saragovi HU.

Author information: 
(1)McGill Cancer Centre, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec H3G 1Y6, Canada.

Hox genes encode transcription factors that are major determinants of embryonic
patterning. Recently, we and others have shown that specific recognition of
target sites in DNA is partly achieved through cooperative interaction with the
extradenticle/pre-B-cell transformation-related gene (EXD/PBX) family of
homeodomain-containing proteins. This interaction is mediated by the YPWM motif
present N-terminal to the homeodomain in HOX proteins. In the present study, we
use YPWM peptides to confirm the importance of this motif for mediating HOX/PBX
interactions. We also used a novel monoclonal antibody directed against the YPWM 
to show that occlusion of this motif abrogates cooperativity with PBX. In
addition, we present evidence that residues flanking the YPWM, both N-terminally 
and C-terminally, stabilize the HOX.PBX cooperative complex. Because these
flanking residues are also conserved among paralogs, they are likely to help
distinguish the specificity of HOX/PBX interactions. Our data further show that
the relative importance of individual residues within and flanking the YPWM is
dependent on the identity of position 6 of the cooperative binding site
(TGATTNATGG). These results suggest that interactions between PBX and the YPWM
motif are modified by a base pair predicted to contact the N-terminal arm of the 
HOX homeodomain.

Positive cross-regulation and enhancer sharing: two mechanisms for specifying
overlapping Hox expression patterns.

Author information:

Vertebrate Hox genes display nested and overlapping patterns of expression.
During mouse hindbrain development, Hoxb3 and Hoxb4 share an expression domain
caudal to the boundary between rhombomeres 6 and 7. Transgenic analysis reveals
that an enhancer (CR3) is shared between both genes and specifies this domain of 
overlap. Both the position of CR3 within the complex and its sequence are
conserved from fish to mammals, suggesting it has a common role in regulating the
vertebrate HoxB complex. CR3 mediates transcriptional activation by multiple Hox 
genes, including Hoxb4, Hoxd4, and Hoxb5 but not Hoxb1. It also functions as a
selective HOX response element in Drosophila, where activation depends on
Deformed, Sex combs reduced, and Antennapedia but not labial. Taken together,
these data show that a Deformed/Hoxb4 autoregulatory loop has been conserved
between mouse and Drosophila. In addition, these studies reveal the existence of 
positive cross-regulation and enhancer sharing as two mechanisms for reinforcing 
the overlapping expression domains of vertebrate Hox genes. In contrast,
Drosophila Hox genes do not appear to share enhancers and where they overlap in
expression, negative cross-regulatory interactions are observed. Therefore,
despite many well documented aspects of Hox structural and functional
conservation, there are mechanistic differences in Hox complex regulation between
arthropods and vertebrates.

Distinct HOX N-terminal arm residues are responsible for specificity of DNA
recognition by HOX monomers and HOX.PBX heterodimers.

Phelan ML(1), Featherstone MS.

Author information: 
(1)McGill Cancer Centre, McGill University, Montréal, Québec H3G 1Y6, Canada.

Dimerization with extradenticle or PBX homeoproteins dramatically improves DNA
binding by HOX transcription factors, indicating that recognition by such
complexes is important for HOX specificity. For HOX monomeric binding, a major
determinant of specificity is the flexible N-terminal arm. It makes base-specific
contacts via the minor groove, including one to the 1st position of a 5'-TNAT-3' 
core by a conserved arginine (Arg-5). Here we show that Arg-5 also contributes to
the stability of HOX.PBX complexes, apparently by forming the same DNA contact.
We further show that heterodimers of PBX with HOXA1 or HOXD4 proteins have
different specificities at another position recognized by the N-terminal arm (the
2nd position in the TNAT core). Importantly, N-terminal arm residues 2 and 3,
which distinguish the binding of HOXA1 and HOXD4 monomers, play no role in the
specificity of their complexes with PBX. In addition, HOXD9 and HOXD10, which are
capable of binding both TTAT and TAAT sites as monomers, can cooperate with PBX1A
only on a TTAT site. These data suggest that some DNA contacts made by the
N-terminal arm are altered by interaction with PBX.

Evolutionary analyses of hedgehog and Hoxd-10 genes in fish species closely
related to the zebrafish.

The study of development has relied primarily on the isolation of mutations in
genes with specific functions in development and on the comparison of their
expression patterns in normal and mutant phenotypes. Comparative evolutionary
analyses can complement these approaches. Phylogenetic analyses of Sonic hedgehog
(Shh) and Hoxd-10 genes from 18 cyprinid fish species closely related to the
zebrafish provide novel insights into the functional constraints acting on Shh.
Our results confirm and extend those gained from expression and crystalline
structure analyses of this gene. Unexpectedly, exon 1 of Shh is found to be
almost invariant even in third codon positions among these morphologically
divergent species suggesting that this exon encodes for a functionally important 
domain of the hedgehog protein. This is surprising because the main functional
domain of Shh had been thought to be that encoded by exon 2. Comparisons of Shh
and Hoxd-10 gene sequences and of resulting gene trees document higher
evolutionary constraints on the former than on the latter. This might be
indicative of more general evolutionary patterns in networks of developmental
regulatory genes interacting in a hierarchical fashion. The presence of four
members of the hedgehog gene family in cyprinid fishes was documented and their
homologies to known hedgehog genes in other vertebrates were established.

In vivo targeted mutagenesis of a regulatory element required for positioning the
Hoxd-11 and Hoxd-10 expression boundaries.

Author information:

Switzerland.

Vertebrate Hox genes are required for the proper organization of structures along
the rostrocaudal axis. Hoxd-11 is expressed in the posterior part of the embryo, 
up to the level of prevertebra 27, and its expression boundary is reproduced by a
Hoxd-11/lacZ transgene. Expression of this transgene anterior to prevertebra 27
is prevented by the silencing activity of a cis-acting element, region IX. Using 
transgenic mice, we show that Hoxd-11 repression by region IX is necessary to
position the sacrum properly. This silencing activity depends on phylogenetically
conserved sequences able to bind in vitro retinoic acid receptors and COUP-TFs.
ES cells were used to generate mice carrying a subtle mutation that abolishes
binding of nuclear receptors to region IX. Mutant mice display an anterior shift 
of their lumbosacral transition inherited as a codominant trait. In mutant
embryos, expression of both Hoxd-11 and Hoxd-10 mRNAs in the prevertebral column 
is anteriorized. These results illustrate the sharing, in cis, of a single
regulatory element in order to establish the expression boundaries of two
neighboring Hoxd genes.

In vitro and transgenic analysis of a human HOXD4 retinoid-responsive enhancer.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory of Developmental Neurobiology, National Institute of Medical
Research, London, UK.

Expression of vertebrate Hox genes is regulated by retinoids in cell culture and 
in early embryonic development. We have identified a 185-bp retinoid-responsive
transcriptional enhancer 5' of the human HOXD4 gene, which regulates inducibility
of the gene in embryonal carcinoma cells through a pattern of DNA-protein
interaction on at least two distinct elements. One of these elements contains a
direct repeat mediating ligand-dependent interaction with retinoic acid
receptors, and is necessary though not sufficient for the enhancer function. The 
HOXD4 enhancer directs expression of a lacZ reporter gene in the neural tube of
transgenic mouse embryos in a time-regulated and regionally restricted fashion,
reproducing part of the anterior neuroectodermal expression pattern of the
endogenous Hoxd-4 gene. Administration of retinoic acid to developing embryos
causes alterations in the spatial restriction of the transgene expression domain,
indicating that the HOXD4 enhancer is also a retinoid-responsive element in vivo.
The timing of the retinoic acid response differs from that seen with more 3' Hox 
genes, in that it occurs much later. This shows that the temporal window of
competence in the ability to respond to retinoic acid differs between Hox genes
and can be linked to specific enhancers. Mutations in the direct repeat or in a
second element in the enhancer affect both retinoid response in culture and
developmental regulation in embryos, suggesting that co-operative interactions
between different factors mediate the enhancer activity. These data provide
further support for a role of endogenous retinoids in regulation and spatial
restriction of Hox gene expression in the central nervous system.

Chromosomal localization of homeobox genes and associated markers on porcine

mouse.

Four homeobox genes that belong to the four homeobox gene clusters known in
mammals have been regionally assigned to four distinct porcine chromosomes in
conserved regions between human and pig. HOXA11, HOXB6, HOXC8, and HOXD4 genes
were mapped by radioactive in situ hybridization to porcine Chromosomes (Chrs)
18q21-24 (with a secondary signal in 16q14-21), 12p11-12, 5p11-12, and 15q22-23
respectively. Besides, we have also revealed the presence of a porcine homeobox
(pig Hbx24) which, although showing DNA sequence homology with a mouse gene of
HOXB cluster, was located on porcine Chr 3 (3p14-13) outside the Hox clusters. To
support the identity of the homeobox gene clusters analyzed and in the light of
the high sequence similarity among homeobox genes, we also localized markers
known to be mapped near each Hox cluster in human. In this way, four genes were
also mapped in pig: GAPD (5q12-21), GAD1 (15q21-22), INHBA (18q24), and IGFBP3
(18q24). Mapping of HOXA11, INHBA, and IGFBP3 on pig Chr 18 constitutes the first
assignments of genes on this small chromosome. These new localizations extend the
information on the conservation of four human chromosomal regions in the pig
genome.

Teleost HoxD and HoxA genes: comparison with tetrapods and functional evolution
of the HOXD complex.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Zoology and Animal Biology, University of Geneva, Switzerland.

In tetrapods, Hox genes are essential for the proper organization and development
of axial structures. Experiments involving Hox gene inactivations have revealed
their particularly important functions in the establishment of morphological
transitions within metameric series such as the vertebral column. Teleost fish
show a much simpler range of axial (trunk or appendicular) morphologies, which
prompted us to investigate the nature of the Hox system in these lower
vertebrates. Here, we show that fish have a family of Hox genes, very similar in 
both number and general organization, to that of tetrapods. Expression studies,
carried out with HoxD and HoxA genes, showed that all vertebrates use the same
general scheme, involving the colinear activation of gene expression in both
space and time. Comparisons between tetrapods and fish allowed us to propose a
model which accounts for the primary function of this gene family. In this model,
a few ancestral Hox genes were involved in the determination of polarity in the
digestive tract and were further recruited in more elaborate axial structures.

Up-regulation of HOXC6, HOXD1, and HOXD8 homeobox gene expression in human
neuroblastoma cells following chemical induction of differentiation.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Northwestern University, Chicago, Ill 60611, USA.

An early event in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma (NB), a tumor derived from
embryonal neural crest tissue, appears to be the arrested differentiation of
neuroblasts. However, NB cells can be induced to differentiate in vitro with
numerous chemicals including retinoic acid (RA) and dibutyryl cyclic AMP
(db-cAMP). One family of transcription factors, encoded by the homeobox (HOX)
genes, plays a crucial role in Drosophila, Xenopus, and mammalian embryonic
differentiation and development. We have previously identified six HOX genes
(HOXC6, HOXC8, HOXD1, HOXD4, HOXD8, and HOXD9), by a sensitive PCR-based
approach, in a cDNA library prepared from the human LA-N-5 NB cell line induced
to differentiate with RA. In this report, we studied the regulation of these six 
HOX genes in a series of NB cell lines chemically induced to differentiate.
Untreated NB cells express low or undetectable levels of HOX mRNA, and HOXC8
remains undetectable in the induced cells. However, a significant induction of
HOXC6, HOXD1, and HOXD8 expression is seen in the RA-treated NB cell lines,
albeit with different patterns and degree of up-regulation. db-cAMP treatment
also induced HOXC6 and HOXD8 expression in two of the three NB cell lines
analyzed. Low levels of HOXD4 and HOXD9 induction were observed in two and one
RA-treated NB cell line, respectively. Up-regulation of HOXC6, HOXD1, and HOXD8
expression in human NB cells, chemically induced to differentiate, appears to be 
associated with maturation toward a differentiated neuronal phenotype.

Mutations in paralogous Hox genes result in overlapping homeotic transformations

(1)Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center, Houston 77030, USA.

Hoxd-4 (previously known as Hox-4.2 and -5.1) is a mouse homeobox-containing gene
homologous to the Drosophila homeotic gene Deformed. During embryogenesis, Hoxd-4
is expressed in the presumptive hindbrain and spinal cord, prevertebrae, and
other tissues. In the adult, Hoxd-4 transcripts are expressed predominantly in
the testis and kidney, and to a lesser extent in intestine and heart. To
understand the role of Hoxd-4 during mouse embryogenesis, we generated Hoxd-4
mutant mice. Mice heterozygous or homozygous for the Hoxd-4 mutation exhibit
homeotic transformations of the second cervical vertebrae (C2) to the first
cervical vertebrae (C1) and malformations of the neural arches of C1 to C3 and of
the basioccipital bone. The phenotype was incompletely penetrant and showed
variable expressivity on both an F2 hybrid and 129 inbred genetic background. The
mutant phenotype was detected in the cartilaginous skeleton of 14.5-day (E14.5)
mutant embryos but no apparent differences were detected in the somites of E9.5
mutant embryos, suggesting that the abnormalities develop after E9.5 perhaps
during or after resegmentation of the somites to form the prevertebrae. These
results suggest that Hoxd-4 plays a role in conferring position information along
the anteroposterior axis in the skeleton. The phenotypic similarities and
differences between Hoxd-4 and previously reported Hoxa-4 and Hoxb-4 mutant mice 
suggest that Hox gene paralogs have both redundant and unique functions.

Expression of HOXC4 homeoprotein in the nucleus of activated human lymphocytes.

Author information: 
(1)Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genova, Italy.

We have analyzed the expression of homeoproteins of the HOX family in resting and
activated lymphoid cells and in neoplastic lymphoid cell lines by the use of
monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) already shown to react with the homeoproteins
HOXA10, HOXC6, and HOXD4, respectively. Anti-HOXA10 and C6 MoAbs DIDi not show
any reactivity with the lymphoid cells tested, whereas anti-HOXD4 MoAb stained
few resting peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and most phytohemagglutinin
(PHA)-stimulated PBLs as early as 6 hours after stimulation. The pattern of
staining of PHA-activated PBLs is reminiscent of the stages of nucleolar
fragmentation in different phases of the cell cycle. The MoAb reacted also with
activated or Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells, with clonal or polyclonal T 
and natural killer (NK) cells, with leukemic T-cell lines, and with a Burkitt's
lymphoma cell line. RNAse protection experiments, per formed with probes specific
for HOXD4 or for the highly homologous HOXA4, HOXB4, and HOXC4, belonging to the 
same paralogy group, indicated that only HOXC4 mRNA is present in resting or
activated PBLs. Northern blot analysis on polyA+ RNA from activated PBLs or Raji 
cells showed the presence of two different HOXC4 transcripts of 2.8 and 1.9 kb.
Gel retardation and Southwestern blot assays showed the presence of a 32-kD
homeoprotein with DNA-binding properties typical of a HOX4 homeoprotein in
nucleolar extracts of PHA-activated, but not of resting, lymphocytes. Taken
together, these data indicate that the HOXC4 homeoprotein is expressed in
activated and/or proliferating lymphocytes of the T-, B-, or NK-cell lineage,
whereas it is weakly expressed in a minority of resting cells. The early
expression and the nucleolar localization suggest an involvement of HOXC4 in the 
regulation of genes controlling lymphocyte activation and/or proliferation.

Nucleolar localisation of three Hox homeoproteins.

(1)Advanced Biotechnology Center, C.B.A., IST, Genova, Italy.

Homeoproteins encoded by genes of the Hox family are nuclear proteins believed to
act as transcription factors and to participate in the determination of the body 
plan. Here we show that in several vertebrate cells, they exhibit a subnuclear
localisation associated with the nucleolus. We used monoclonal antibodies to
study the distribution of three homeoproteins, namely HOXB7, HOXC6 and HOXD4. The
immunoreactivity to antibodies against HOXC6 protein in Xenopus laevis embryonic 
tissues is restricted to one or two spots within the nucleus; this distribution
partially overlaps that of fibrillarin, a protein of the fibrillar zone of the
nucleoli. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis of the distribution of HOXB7
protein in 3T3 cells, and of HOXD4 protein in human neuroblastoma and Raji
lymphoma cell lines and activated lymphocytes, results invariably in a nucleolar 
localisation. Purified nucleoli from stimulated T lymphocytes, and Raji cells
contain an activity capable of binding, in a gel retardation assay, to an
oligonucleotide specifically recognised by the HOXD4 homeoprotein. This activity 
is specifically removed by anti-HOXD4 antibodies and is found associated in
southwestern blots with a single band with an apparent M(r) of 30,000,
corresponding to that of recombinant HOXD4. The functional significance of the
nucleolar localisation of Hox proteins remains to be determined.

Functional differences between HOX proteins conferred by two residues in the
homeodomain N-terminal arm.

Phelan ML(1), Sadoul R, Featherstone MS.

Author information: 
(1)McGill Cancer Centre, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.

Hox genes encode homeodomain-containing transcriptional regulators that function 
during development to specify positional identity along embryonic axes. The
homeodomain is composed of a flexible N-terminal arm and three alpha helices, and
it differentially binds DNA. A number of homeodomains recognize sites containing 
a TAAT core motif. The product of the murine Hoxd-4 (Hox-4.2) gene functions in a
positive autoregulatory fashion in P19 cells that is dependent on two TAAT motifs
in the Hoxd-4 promoter. This effect is specific in that murine HOXA-1 (HOX-1.6)
is unable to activate transcription through the Hoxd-4 autoregulatory element.
Here we show that this is due to an inability of the HOXA-1 homeodomain to bind a
HOXD-4 recognition site effectively. We have produced chimeras between HOXD-4 and
HOXA-1 to map specific residues responsible for this functional difference. When 
positions 2 and 3 in the N-terminal arm of HOXA-1 were converted to HOXD-4
identity, both strong DNA binding and transcriptional activation were rescued.
This substitution appears to confer an increased DNA-binding ability on the
HOXA-1 homeodomain, since we were unable to detect a high-affinity recognition
sequence for HOXA-1 in a randomized pool of DNA probes. The contribution of
position 3 to DNA binding has been implicated by structural studies, but this is 
the first report of the importance of position 2 in regulating homeodomain-DNA
interactions. Additionally, specific homeodomain residues that confer major
differences in DNA binding and transcriptional activation between Hox gene
products have not been previously determined. Identity at these two positions is 
generally conserved among paralogs but varies between Hox gene subfamilies. As a 
result, these residues may be important for the regulation of target gene
expression by specific Hox products.

Vertebrate Hox homeobox genes are transcription factors which regulate
antero-posterior axial identity in embryogenesis, presumably through activation
and/or repression of downstream target genes. Some of these targets were reported
to code for molecules involved in cell-cell interactions, whereas no relationship
has yet been demonstrated between Hox genes and other transcription factors
involved in determining and/or maintaining tissue specificity. The thyroid
transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) is a homeodomain-containing protein required for
expression of thyroid-specific genes. A 862 bp 5' genomic fragment of the rat
TTF-1 gene, conferring thyroid-specific expression to a reporter gene, was
sufficient to mediate transactivation by the human HOXB3 gene in co-transfection 
assay in both NIH3T3 or HeLa cells. HOXB3 is expressed in early mammalian
embryogenesis in the anterior neuroectoderm, branchial arches and their
derivatives, including the area of the thyroid primordia and thyroid gland.
Transcription of the TTF-1 promoter is induced only by HOXB3, while its
paralogous gene HOXD3 or other Hox genes expressed more posteriorly (HOXA4,
HOXD4, HOXC5, HOXC6, HOXC8 and Hoxd-8) have no effect. Transactivation by HOXB3
is mediated by two binding sites containing an ATTA core located at -100 and +30 
from the transcription start site. DNase I footprinting experiments show that the
two sites bind HOXB3 protein synthesized in both Escherichia coli and eukaryotic 
cells, as well as nuclear factor(s) present in protein extracts obtained from
mouse embryonic tissues which express group 3 Hox genes and TTF-1. Some of the
DNA-protein complexes formed by the embryonic extracts are indistinguishable from
those generated by HOXB3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

A proline-rich transcriptional activation domain in murine HOXD-4 (HOX-4.2).

The product of the murine Hoxd-4 (Hox-4.2) gene is a transcription factor that
acts upon an autoregulatory element in Hoxd-4 upstream sequences (1). Using this 
activity as an assay in transient transfections of P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC)
cells, we performed a mutational analysis to map functional domains in the HOXD-4
protein. The importance of the homeodomain was shown by a single amino acid
change in this region that abolished activity. Deletion analysis revealed that
many evolutionarily conserved regions outside of the homeodomain were dispensable
for activation in our assay. Fusions to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain mapped a
transcriptional activation function to the HOXD-4 proline-rich N-terminus. The
proline-rich transcription factor AP2 squelched activation by HOXD-4 and by
GAL4/HOXD-4 N-terminus fusion proteins. Together, these results suggest that
HOXD-4 harbors a transcriptional activation domain of the proline-rich type.

Regulation of the human HOXD4 gene by retinoids.

Hox genes are developmentally regulated in mammalian embryogenesis, according to 
temporally and spatially restricted patterns which are affected by retinoids,
vitamin A derivatives which have a function as, or at least mimic the action of, 
axis-specifying morphogens. In the human embryonal carcinoma cell line NT2/D1,
HOX gene clusters are activated by at least two retinoids, all-trans- and
9-cis-retinoic acid (RA), in a 3' to 5' sequential cascade which reproduces the
activation pattern observed in early embryogenesis. We have studied the
regulation of the early activated HOXD4 gene, which is expressed in human
embryogenesis in multiple transcripts generated by the developmentally controlled
use of alternative transcription start sites and polyadenylation signals.
Transfection of a 2.9 kb HOXD4 upstream genomic region linked to a reporter gene 
in NT2/D1 cells, allowed the identification of two different promoters and a
distal enhancer element necessary for RA-dependent gene activation. This element 
confers to a heterologous promoter the ability to be induced by RA in NT2/D1
cells, and transactivated by alpha, beta and gamma retinoic acid receptors
(RARs), but not retinoid X receptor (RXR), in COS-7 cells. DNase I footprinting
analysis allowed the identification of four sequences which bind nuclear factors 
from both RA-induced NT2/D1 cells and embryonic tissues with similar patterns.
The use of specific antibodies allowed the identification of at least RAR beta in
some of the DNA-protein complexes, although the four sequences bind single RARs
transfected in COS cells much less efficiently, or not at all, when compared to a
canonical RAR responsive element. Induction of the HOXD4 promoter-enhancer in the
presence of a selective RAR alpha antagonist indicated that the RAR
alpha-dependent RAR beta activation is nevertheless a necessary step in HOX gene 
activation. Our results indicate that the ligand-dependent activity of RARs upon 
specific, cis-acting regulatory elements may have a key role in the induction of 
early activated HOX genes in response to retinoids. However, RARs represent only 
a fraction of the transcription factors interacting with the RA-responsive HOXD4 
enhancer, which appears to be a complex element requiring specific combinations
of nuclear factors for its proper function.

Neuroblastoma, a malignancy of early childhood arises in the embryonal neural
crest. Neuroblastoma cells are in a state of arrested differentiation; however,
they can be induced to differentiate in vitro by retinoic acid. As a first step
toward understanding the molecular mechanisms of neuroblastoma differentiation we
analyzed the expression pattern of the developmentally important Homeobox genes
in cells treated with retinoic acid. The strategy employed involved rapid
screening of a cDNA library prepared from retinoic acid treated human LA-N-5
neuroblastoma cells for Homeobox genes by the polymerase chain reaction. Multiple
Homeobox genes were amplified from recombinant phage DNA using degenerate primers
directed against the conserved homeobox. To date 6 Homeobox genes (HoxC6, HoxC8, 
HoxD1, HoxD4, HoxD8, and HoxD9) have been identified in the cDNA library prepared
from LA-N-5 cells treated with retinoic acid. HoxD1 and HoxC8 are being reported 
for the first time to be expressed in neuroblastoma cells. Preliminary studies
indicate that there is an induction of Homeobox gene expression in
differentiating LA-N-5 neuroblastoma cells.

HOX4 genes encode transcription factors with potential auto- and cross-regulatory
capacities.

We have looked for the binding of several HOX4 complex homeoproteins in the
genomic region containing the HOX4C promoter, between the human HOX4C and HOX4D
genes. The HOX4C, HOX4D and Hox-4.3 homeoproteins bind to a phylogenetically
highly conserved DNA fragment, which is located in the proximal part of this
intergenic region and contains multiple binding sites for these HOX4 proteins.
Using cotransfection experiments, we show that this endogenous DNA sequence can
mediate transactivation by the HOX4D and HOX4C proteins and that this effect
requires the presence of TAAT-related binding sites. The Hox-4.3 protein, in
contrast, is unable to activate and can repress the activation observed with the 
two other proteins. These results show that the HOX4D and HOX4C genes are genuine
sequence-specific transcription factors and suggest that, as in Drosophila,
cross-regulatory interactions between these genes might be essential for their
proper expression.
