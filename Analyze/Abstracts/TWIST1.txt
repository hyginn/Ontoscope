Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is a functional microcirculation pattern in malignant
tumors accompanied by endothelium-dependent vessels and mosaic vessels. VM has
been identified in more than 15 solid tumor types and is associated with poor
differentiation, late clinical stage and poor prognosis. Classic anti-angiogenic 
agents do not target endothelium-dependent vessels and are not efficacious
against tumors exhibiting VM. Further insight into the molecular signaling that
triggers and promotes VM formation could improve anti-angiogenic therapeutics.
Recent studies have shown that cancer stem cells (CSCs) and
epithelium-to-endothelium transition (EET), a subtype of
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), accelerate VM formation by
stimulating tumor cell plasticity, remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM) and 
connecting VM channels with host blood vessels. VM channel-lining cells originate
from CSCs due to expression of EMT inducers such as Twist1, which promote EET and
ECM remodeling. Hypoxia and high interstitial fluid pressure in the tumor
microenvironment induce a specific type of cell death, linearly patterned
programmed cell necrosis (LPPCN), which spatially guides VM and
endothelium-dependent vessel networks. This review focuses on the roles of CSCs
and EET in VM, and on possible novel anti-angiogenic strategies against
alternative tumor vascularization.

Twist1 is well known to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
promote tumor metastasis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the EMT process and 
are associated with metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present 
study, microRNA-26b-5p (miR-26b-5p) expression was consistently and significantly
downregulated in HepG2-Twist1 HCC cell lines compared with HepG2-vector cell
lines using microarrays (the HepG2-Twist1 cell line can stably express Twist1).
miR-26b- 5p downregulation was directly mediated by Twist1 through binding to the
promoter region of miR-26b-5p in HepG2-Twist1 cells by ChIP-seq technology. Both 
gain- and loss-of-function studies showed that miR-26b-5p dramatically suppressed
EMT and the invasion ability of HCC cells in vitro. Using mouse models, tumors
derived from miR- 26b-5p-overexpressed HCC cells exhibited a significant
reduction in tumorigenicity compared with the control group. Subsequent
investigation revealed that miR-26b-5p directly inhibited SMAD family member 1
(SMAD1) expression. miR-26b-5p repressed BMP4/Smad1 signaling following SMAD1
inhibition. Overexpression of SMAD1 reversed the function of miR-26b-5p. In human
HCC tissues and mouse xenograft tumors, miR-26b-5p levels were inversely
correlated with SMAD1 expression as well as metastasis.CONCLUSION: miR-26b-5p
suppresses Twist1-induced EMT, invasion, and metastasis of HCC cells by targeting
SMAD1 and BMP4/Smad1 signaling. This suggests a promising application for
miR-26b-5p in anti-HCC therapy.

Gene expression-based classification systems have identified an aggressive colon 
cancer subtype with mesenchymal features, possibly reflecting
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tumor cells. However, stromal
fibroblasts contribute extensively to the mesenchymal phenotype of aggressive
colon tumors, challenging the notion of tumor EMT. To separately study the
neoplastic and stromal compartments of colon tumors, we have generated a stroma
gene filter (SGF). Comparative analysis of stroma(high) and stroma(low) tumors
shows that the neoplastic cells in stroma(high) tumors express specific EMT
drivers (ZEB2, TWIST1, TWIST2) and that 98% of differentially expressed genes are
strongly correlated with them. Analysis of differential gene expression between
mesenchymal and epithelial cancer cell lines revealed that hepatocyte nuclear
factor 4a (HNF4a), a transcriptional activator of intestinal (epithelial)
differentiation, and its target genes are highly expressed in epithelial cancer
cell lines. However, mesenchymal-type cancer cell lines expressed only part of
the mesenchymal genes expressed by tumor-derived neoplastic cells, suggesting
that external cues were lacking. We found that collagen-I dominates the
extracellular matrix in aggressive colon cancer. Mimicking the tumor
microenvironment by replacing laminin-rich Matrigel with collagen-I was
sufficient to induce tumor-specific mesenchymal gene expression, suppression of
HNF4a and its target genes, and collective tumor cell invasion of patient-derived
colon tumor organoids. The data connect collagen-rich stroma to mesenchymal gene 
expression in neoplastic cells and to collective tumor cell invasion. Targeting
the tumor-collagen interface may therefore be explored as a novel strategy in the
treatment of aggressive colon cancer.Oncogene advance online publication, 21

BACKGROUND: We recently demonstrated that brain endothelial cells and astrocytes 
protect cancer cells from chemotherapy through an endothelin-dependent signaling 
mechanism. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of macitentan, a dual endothelin
receptor (ETAR and ETBR) antagonist, in the treatment of experimental breast and 
lung cancer brain metastases.
METHODS: The effect of macitentan on astrocyte- and brain endothelial
cell-mediated chemoprotective properties was measured in cytotoxic assays. We
compared survival of mice bearing established MDA-MB-231 breast cancer or PC-14
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) brain metastases that were treated with
vehicle, macitentan, paclitaxel, or macitentan plus paclitaxel. Cell division,
apoptosis, tumor vasculature, and expression of survival-related proteins were
assessed by immunofluorescent microscopy.
RESULTS: Cancer cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells expressed activated 
forms of AKT and MAPK in vehicle- and paclitaxel-treated groups in both
metastasis models, but these proteins were downregulated in metastases of mice
that received macitentan. The survival-related proteins Bcl2L1, Gsta5, and Twist1
that localized to cancer cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells in vehicle-
and paclitaxel-treated tumors were suppressed by macitentan. Macitentan or
paclitaxel alone had no effect on survival. However, when macitentan was combined
with paclitaxel, we noted a significant reduction in cancer cell division and
marked apoptosis of both cancer cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells.
Moreover, macitentan plus paclitaxel therapy significantly increased overall
survival by producing complete responses in 35 of 35 mice harboring brain
metastases.
CONCLUSIONS: Dual antagonism of ETAR and ETBR signaling sensitizes experimental
brain metastases to paclitaxel and may represent a new therapeutic option for
patients with brain metastases.

INTRODUCTION: The multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast (STB) is maintained and
regenerated by the fusion of underlying cytotrophoblast cells (CTBs) and is
responsible for a number of functions in the human placenta. Deficiencies in this
structure may result in pregnancy-associated diseases. However, the detailed
mechanisms underlying trophoblast syncytialization await further investigation.
METHODS: The location of the transcription factor Twist1 in human placental
tissues was identified by immunohistochemistry. The expression of Twist1 and
glial cells missing-1 (GCM1) was evaluated by qPCR or western blotting in two
cell-fusion models including forskolin-induced fusion of BeWo cells and
spontaneous syncytialization of CTBs. The key role of Twist1 in trophoblast
differentiation was identified using BeWo cells transfected with Twist1-specific 
siRNA. We investigated the effect of hypoxia on the expression of Twist1 and GCM1
in primary CTBs cultured with 2% oxygen. The Twist1 binding region in the GCM1
gene was detected by chromatin-immunoprecipitation.
RESULTS: Twist1 was expressed in human placental tissues, and the expression of
Twist1 and GCM1 increased in a time-dependent manner during spontaneous
syncytialization of primary CTBs and forskolin-induced fusion of BeWo cells. A
reduction in Twist1 and GCM1 expression was observed under hypoxic conditions and
was accompanied by inhibition of trophoblast syncytialization. Moreover,
siRNA-mediated silencing of Twist1 resulted in inhibition of BeWo cells fusion
and down-regulation of GCM1 expression. Furthermore, Twist1 was found to bind to 
the E-box-enriched region in intron 2 of the GCM1 gene during forskolin-induced
fusion of BeWo cells.
DISCUSSION: The above results suggest that Twist1 is required during trophoblast 
syncytialization. Twist1 may promote trophoblast syncytialization by regulating
the expression of GCM1.

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important mechanism of
resistance to angiogenesis inhibition. The ability of EMT pathway genetic
variants to predict the efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapy is unknown. We
analyzed associations between functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
in EMT-related genes and outcomes in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients
undergoing first-line bevacizumab-based chemotherapy. A total of 220 mCRC
patients were included in this study: 143 patients treated with first-line
bevacizumab-based chemotherapy (bevacizumab cohort) and 77 patients treated with 
cetuximab-based chemotherapy (cetuximab cohort). SNPs in TWIST1 (rs2285682,
rs2285681), ZEB1 (rs10826943, rs2839658), SNAIL (rs1543442, rs4647958), and
E-cadherin (rs16260) genes were analyzed by PCR-based direct sequencing. Patients
carrying a TWIST1 rs2285682 G allele had a significantly longer median PFS of
18.1 months and OS of 44.1 months compared to those with the T/T genotype, who
had a median PFS of 13.3 months (HR, 0.57; P=0.003) and OS of 29.2 months (HR,
0.53; P=0.001) in the bevacizumab cohort. In multivariate analysis, associations 
between TWIST1 rs2285682 and PFS and OS remained significant. Among women, the G 
allele of TWIST1 rs2285682 (PFS HR, 0.39, P=0.007; OS HR, 0.30 P=0.001) and
TWIST1 rs2285681 (PFS HR, 0.27, P<0.001; OS HR, 0.25 P<0.001) was associated with
improved survival. No significant associations were found in the cetuximab
cohort. Our findings suggest that TWIST1 polymorphisms are associated with
survival in mCRC patients treated with first-line bevacizumab-based chemotherapy 
and may serve as clinically useful biomarkers for anti-angiogenic therapy.

Cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) is a major E2 hydroxylase involved in the metabolism
of potential carcinogens. CYP1B1 expression has been reported to be higher in
tumors compared to normal tissues, especially in hormone-related cancers
including breast, ovary, and prostate tumors. To explore the role of CYP1B1 in
cancer progression, we investigated the action of CYP1B1 in cells with increased 
CYP1B1 via the inducer 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) or an overexpression
vector, in addition to decreased CYP1B1 via the inhibitor tetramethoxystilbene
(TMS) or siRNA knockdown. We observed that CYP1B1 promoted cell proliferation,
migration, and invasion in MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells. To understand its molecular
mechanism, we measured key oncogenic proteins including ß-catenin, c-Myc, ZEB2,
and matrix metalloproteinases following CYP1B1 modulation. CYP1B1 induced
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and activated Wnt/ß-catenin signaling via
upregulation of CTNNB1, ZEB2, SNAI1, and TWIST1. Sp1, a transcription factor
involved in cell growth and metastasis, was positively regulated by CYP1B1, and
suppression of Sp1 expression by siRNA or DNA binding activity using mithramycin 
A blocked oncogenic transformation by CYP1B1. Therefore, we suggest that Sp1 acts
as a key mediator for CYP1B1 action. Treatment with 4-hydroxyestradiol (4-OHE2), 
a major metabolite generated by CYP1B1, showed similar effects as CYP1B1
overexpression, indicating that CYP1B1 activity mediated various oncogenic events
in cells. In conclusion, our data suggests that CYP1B1 promotes cell
proliferation and metastasis by inducing EMT and Wnt/ß-catenin signaling via Sp1 
induction.

In addition to their stem/progenitor properties, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
also exhibit potent effector (angiogenic, antiinflammatory, immuno-modulatory)
functions that are largely paracrine in nature. It is widely believed that
effector functions underlie most of the therapeutic potential of MSCs and are
independent of their stem/progenitor properties. Here we demonstrate that
stem/progenitor and effector functions are coordinately regulated at the cellular
level by the transcription factor Twist1 and specified within populations
according to a hierarchical model. We further show that manipulation of Twist1
levels by genetic approaches or by exposure to widely used culture supplements
including fibroblast growth factor 2 (Ffg2) and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)
alters MSC efficacy in cell-based and in vivo assays in a predictable manner.
Thus, by mechanistically linking stem/progenitor and effector functions our
studies provide a unifying framework in the form of an MSC hierarchy that models 
the functional complexity of populations. Using this framework, we developed a
CLinical Indications Prediction (CLIP) scale that predicts how donor-to-donor
heterogeneity and culture conditions impact the therapeutic efficacy of MSC
populations for different disease indications.

The Small C-terminal Domain Phosphatase 1 Inhibits Cancer Cell Migration and
Invasion by Dephosphorylating Phospho-Ser68-Twist1 to Accelerate Twist1
Degradation.

Twist1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that strongly promotes
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, invasion and metastasis of
cancer cells. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-phosphorylated Twist1
on its serine 68 (P-S68-Twist1) has a significantly enhanced stability and
function to drive cancer cell invasion and metastasis. However, the phosphatase
that dephosphorylates P-S68-Twist1 and destabilizes Twist1 has not been
identified and characterized. In this study, we screened a serine/threonine
phosphatase cDNA expression library in HEK293T cells with ectopically coexpressed
Twist1. We found that the small C-terminal domain phosphatase 1 (SCP1)
specifically dephosphorylates P-S68-Twist1 in both cell-free reactions and live
cells. SCP1 uses its amino acid residues 43-63 to interact with the N-terminus of
Twist1. Increased SCP1 expression in cells decreased P-S68-Twist1 and total
Twist1 proteins, while knockdown of SCP1 increased P-S68-Twist1 and total Twist1 
proteins. Furthermore, the levels of SCP1 are negatively correlated with Twist1
protein levels in several cancer cell lines. SCP1-dephosphorylated Twist1
undergoes fast degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Importantly, an 
increase in SCP1 expression in breast cancer cells with either endogenous or
ectopically expressed Twist1 largely inhibits the Twist1-induced EMT phenotype
and the migration and invasion capabilities of these cells. These results
indicate that SCP1 is the phosphatase that counter-regulates the MAPK-mediated
phosphorylation of S68-Twist1. Thus, an increase in SCP1 expression and activity 
may be a useful strategy for eliminating the detrimental roles of Twist1 in
cancer cells.

The transcription factor Twist1 is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition and contributes to cancer metastasis through mostly unknown
mechanisms. In colorectal cancer, Twist1 expression is mainly restricted to the
tumor stroma. We found that human fibroblast cell lines stably transfected with
Twist1 acquired characteristics of activated cancer-associated fibroblasts
(CAFs), such as hyperproliferation, an increased ability to migrate and an
alignment of the actin cytoskeleton. Further, Twist1-activated fibroblasts
promoted increased matrix stiffness. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified
palladin and collagen a1(VI) as two major mediators of the Twist1 effects in
fibroblast cell lines. Co-immunoprecipitation studies indicated that palladin and
Twist1 interact within the nucleus, suggesting that palladin could act as a
transcription regulator. Palladin was found to be more relevant for the cellular 
biomechanical properties, orientation and polarity, and collagen a1(VI) for the
migration and invasion capacity, of Twist1-activated fibroblasts. Both palladin
and collagen a1(VI) were observed to be overexpressed in colorectal CAFs and to
be associated with poor colorectal cancer patient survival and relapse
prediction. Our results demonstrate that Twist1-expressing fibroblasts mimic the 
properties of CAFs present at the tumor invasive front, which likely explains the
prometastatic activities of Twist1. Twist1 appears to require both palladin and
collagen a1(VI) as downstream effectors for its prometastatic effects, which
could be future therapeutic targets in cancer metastasis.Oncogene advance online

Sézary-Syndrom: von ungelösten Fragen zu neuen Therapieansätzen.

Das Sézary-Syndrom, die leukämische Variante des kutanen T-Zell-Lymphoms, stellt 
immer noch eine Erkrankung mit vielen ungelösten Fragen sowie einer sehr
ungünstigen Prognose dar. In jüngeren Forschungsarbeiten wurde jedoch eine
Vielzahl an fehlregulierten molekularen Signalwegen identifiziert, die zur
malignen Transformation und Therapieresistenz von Sézary-Zellen (SC) beitragen.
Im Hinblick auf die T-Zell-Entwicklung repräsentieren SC entweder naive T-Zellen,
T-Effektor-Gedächtniszellen oder zentrale T-Gedächtniszellen. Funktionell können 
SC in Th2-, Treg- oder sogar Th17-Zellen differenzieren. Trotz ihrer Plastizität 
exprimieren SC charakteristische diagnostische Markerproteine, darunter CD158k,
CD164, FcRL3, und PD-1, sowie Haut-spezifische Homing-Rezeptoren wie CLA und
CCR4. Wie bereits in (vor)klinischen Studien getestet, sind CD158k, PD-1, CTLA-4 
und CCR4 auch vielversprechende therapeutische Zielmoleküle. Die molekularen
Veränderungen bei SC betreffen Transkriptionsfaktoren wie STAT3, 4 und 5 sowie
TWIST1 und TOX. TWIST1 induziert die Expression von DNM3os, das den
miR-199a2/214-Cluster enthält, ein wichtiger Knotenpunkt, über den viele
verschiedene Krebs-Netzwerke reguliert werden. Darüber hinaus verursacht die
Aktivierung von NF<U+03BA>B und des MAPK-Signalwegs sowie eine veränderte
TCR-Signalgebung Resistenz gegenüber Apoptose. Kürzlich wurde durch Genom- und
Exomsequenzierung gezeigt, dass somatische Variationen der Kopienzahl die
vorherrschenden Mutationen bei SC darstellen, wodurch vor allem Apoptose,
NF<U+03BA>B-Signalgebung, DNA-Integrität und T-Zell-Aktivierung beeinflusst werden. Um
die Entwicklung neuer Therapien zu ermöglichen, wird zurzeit an besseren
In-vivo-Modellen gearbeitet, die die Pathogenese und den klinischen Verlauf des
Sézary-Syndroms genauer widerspiegeln.

Sézary syndrome, the leukemic variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, is still an
enigmatic disease with a fatal prognosis. Recent research, however, has
identified a multitude of dysregulated molecular pathways that contribute to
malignant transformation and therapy resistance of Sézary cells (SC). With
respect to T-cell development, SC either represent naive T cells, T effector
memory or T central memory cells. Functionally, SC may differentiate into Th2,
Treg, or even Th17 cells. Despite their plasticity, SC express characteristic
diagnostic marker proteins including CD158k, CD164, FcRL3, and PD-1 as well as
skin-homing receptors such as CLA and CCR4. Already tested in (pre)clinical
trials, CD158k, PD-1, CTLA-4, and CCR4 also represent promising therapeutic
targets. Molecular alterations in SC include transcription factors such as STAT3,
4, and 5, as well as TWIST1 and TOX. TWIST1 induces expression of DNM3os
containing the miR-199a2/214 cluster, a key hub controlling multiple cancer
networks. In addition, activation of NF<U+03BA>B and the MAPK pathway as well as altered
TCR signaling cause apoptosis resistance. Recently, whole genome and exome
sequencing has revealed somatic copy number variations as predominant mutations
in SC, primarily affecting apoptosis, NF<U+03BA>B signaling, DNA integrity, and T-cell
activation. In order to facilitate development of novel therapies, improved in
vivo models, which better reflect the pathogenesis and clinical course of Sézary 
syndrome, are currently being generated.

The embryonic head is the first major body part to be constructed during
embryogenesis. The allocation and the assembly of the progenitor tissues, which
start at gastrulation, are accompanied by the spatiotemporal activity of
transcription factors and signaling pathways that drives lineage specification,
germ layer formation, and cell/tissue movement. The morphogenesis,
regionalization, and patterning of the brain and craniofacial structures rely on 
the function of LIM-domain, homeodomain, and basic helix-loop-helix transcription
factors. These factors constitute the central nodes of a gene regulatory network 
(GRN) which encompasses and intersects with signaling pathways involved with head
formation. It is predicted that the functional output of this "head GRN" impacts 
on cellular function and cell-cell interactions that are essential for lineage
differentiation and tissue modeling, which are key processes underpinning the
formation of the head.

Pre-mRNA processing factor 19 (Prp19) is involved in many cellular events
including pre-mRNA processing and DNA damage response. However, the pathological 
role of Prp19 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still elusive. Here, we
reported that Prp19 was increased in most HCC tissues and HCC cell lines, and its
overexpression in HCC tissues was positively correlated with vascular invasion,
tumor capsule breakthrough and poor prognosis. Prp19 potentiated migratory and
invasive abilities of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore Prp19
facilitated Twist1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Mechanistic
insights revealed that Prp19 directly binded with TGF-ß-activated kinase1 (TAK1) 
and promoted the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
preventing Twist1 from degradation. Finally Prp19/p38 MAPK/Twist1 axis was
attested in nude mice xenografts and HCC patient specimens. This work implies
that the gain of Prp19 is a critical event during the progression of HCC, making 
it a promising target for malignancies with aberrant Prp19 expression.

Direct conversion of fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) offers an
alternative strategy for cardiac disease modeling and regeneration. During iCM
reprogramming, the starting fibroblasts must overcome existing epigenetic
barriers to acquire the CM-like chromatin pattern. However, epigenetic dynamics
along this reprogramming process have not been studied. Here, we took advantage
of our recently generated polycistronic system and determined the dynamics of two
critical histone marks, H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, in parallel with gene expression at
a set of carefully selected cardiac and fibroblast loci during iCM reprogramming.
We observed reduced H3K27me3 and increased H3K4me3 at cardiac promoters as early 
as day 3, paralleled by a rapid significant increase in their mRNA expression. In
contrast, H3K27me3 at loci encoding fibroblast marker genes did not increase
until day 10 and H3K4me3 progressively decreased along the reprogramming process;
these changes were accompanied by a gradual decrease in the mRNA expression of
fibroblast marker genes. Further analyses of fibroblast-enriched transcription
factors revealed a similarly late deposition of H3K27me3 and decreased mRNA
expression of Sox9, Twist1 and Twist2, three important players in
epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Our data suggest early rapid activation of the
cardiac program and later progressive suppression of fibroblast fate at both
epigenetic and transcriptional levels. Additionally, we determined the DNA
methylation states of representative cardiac promoters and found that not every
single CpG was equally demethylated during early stages of iCM reprogramming.
Rather, there are specific CpGs, whose demethylation states correlated tightly
with transcription activation, that we propose are the major contributing CpGs.
Our work thus reveals a differential re-patterning of H3K27me3, H3K4me3 at
cardiac and fibroblast loci during iCM reprogramming and could provide future
genome-wide epigenetic studies with important guidance such as the appropriate
time window and loci to be utilized as positive and negative controls.

Mechanisms underlying the poor breast cancer prognosis among obese women are
unresolved. DNA methylation levels are linked to obesity and to breast cancer
survival. We hypothesized that obesity may work in conjunction with the epigenome
to alter prognosis. Using a population-based sample of women diagnosed with first
primary breast cancer, we examined modification of the obesity-mortality
association by DNA methylation. In-person interviews were conducted approximately
3 months after diagnosis. Weight and height were assessed [to estimate body mass 
index (BMI)], and blood samples collected. Promoter methylation of 13 breast
cancer-related genes was assessed in archived tumor by methylation-specific PCR
and Methyl Light. Global methylation in white blood cell DNA was assessed by
analysis of long interspersed elements-1 (LINE-1) and with the luminometric
methylation assay (LUMA). Vital status among 1308 patients (with any methylation 
biomarker and complete BMI assessment) was determined after approximately
15 years of follow-up (N = 194/441 deaths due to breast cancer-specific/all-cause
mortality). We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios
(HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) using two-sided p values of 0.05.
Breast cancer-specific mortality was higher among obese (BMI = 30) patients with 
promoter methylation in APC (HR = 2.47; 95 % CI = 1.43-4.27) and TWIST1
(HR = 4.25; 95 % CI = 1.43-12.70) in breast cancer tissue. Estimates were
similar, but less pronounced, for all-cause mortality. Increased all-cause
(HR = 1.81; 95 % CI = 1.19-2.74) and breast cancer-specific (HR = 2.61; 95 %
CI = 1.45-4.69) mortality was observed among obese patients with the lowest LUMA 
levels. The poor breast cancer prognosis associated with obesity may depend on
methylation profiles, which warrants further investigation.

: Therapeutic applications of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for treating various 
diseases have increased in recent years. To ensure that treatment is effective,
an adequate MSC dosage should be determined before these cells are used for
therapeutic purposes. To obtain a sufficient number of cells for therapeutic
applications, MSCs must be expanded in long-term cell culture, which inevitably
triggers cellular senescence. In this study, we investigated the surface markers 
of human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (hUCB-MSCs) associated with cellular
senescence using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and 242 cell
surface-marker antibodies. Among these surface proteins, we selected the melanoma
cell adhesion molecule (MCAM/CD146) for further study with the aim of validating 
observed expression differences and investigating the associated implications in 
hUCB-MSCs during cellular senescence. We observed that CD146 expression markedly 
decreased in hUCB-MSCs following prolonged in vitro expansion. Using preparative 
sorting, we found that hUCB-MSCs with high CD146 expression displayed high growth
rates, multilineage differentiation, expression of stemness markers, and
telomerase activity, as well as significantly lower expression of the senescence 
markers p16, p21, p53, and senescence-associated ß-galactosidase, compared with
that observed in hUCB-MSCs with low-level CD146 expression. In contrast, CD146
downregulation with small interfering RNAs enhanced the senescence phenotype. In 
addition, CD146 suppression in hUCB-MSCs caused downregulation of other cellular 
senescence regulators, including Bmi-1, Id1, and Twist1. Collectively, our
results suggest that CD146 regulates cellular senescence; thus, it could be used 
as a therapeutic marker to identify senescent hUCB-MSCs.SIGNIFICANCE: One of the 
fundamental requirements for mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies is the
expansion of MSCs during long-term culture because a sufficient number of
functional cells is required. However, long-term growth inevitably induces
cellular senescence, which potentially causes poor clinical outcomes by inducing 
growth arrest and the loss of stem cell properties. Thus, the identification of
markers for evaluating the status of MSC senescence during long-term culture may 
enhance the success of MSC-based therapy. This study provides strong evidence
that CD146 is a novel and useful marker for predicting senescence in human
umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (hUCB-MSCs), and CD146 can potentially be
applied in quality-control assessments of hUCB-MSC-based therapy.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains one of the most lethal types of cancer in adults. 
The purpose of this study was to determine the role of miR-1271 in regulation of 
epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis of pancreatic cancer
cells. miR-1271 was identified to be significantly down-regulated in PC tissues
by miRNA array. Also, an increase of EMT-regulators ZEB1 and TWIST1 expression
level is accompanied by a decrease of miR-1271. We showed that expression of
miR-1271 was significantly down-regulated in PC tissues as compared with that in 
normal tissues. In addition, our results showed that miR-1271 expression levels
were decreased while ZEB1 and TWIST1 expression levels were increased in detected
PC cell lines. Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-1271 suppressed and
antagomiR-1271 promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion in SW1990 and
PANC-1 cells. Bioinformatics coupled with luciferase and Western blot assays also
revealed that miR-1271 inhibited expression of ZEB1 and TWIST1, which are master 
regulators of tumor metastasis. Our study first indicates that miR-1271 functions
as a suppressor in regulating of pancreatic cancer EMT by targeting ZEB1 and
TWIST1, and it promise as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker for
metastatic pancreatic cancer.

Differentiation between Sézary syndrome (SS) and erythrodermic inflammatory
dermatoses (EID) can be challenging and a number of studies have attempted to
identify characteristic immunophenotypic changes and molecular biomarkers in
Sézary cells that could be useful as additional diagnostic criterion. In this
European multicenter study the sensitivity and specificity of these
immunophenotypic and recently proposed but unconfirmed molecular biomarkers in SS
was investigated. Peripheral blood CD4+ T-cells from 59 SS and 19 EID patients
were analyzed for cell surface proteins by flow cytometry, and for copy number
alterations and differential gene expression using custom made qPCR plates.
Experiments were performed in duplicate in two independent centers using standard
operating procedures with almost identical results. Sézary cells showed MYC gain 
(40%) and MNT loss (66%), upregulation of DNM3 (75%), TWIST1 (69%), EPHA4 (66%)
and PLS3 (66%) and downregulation of STAT4 (91%). Loss of CD26 (= 80% CD4+
T-cells) and/ or CD7 (= 40% CD4+ T-cells) and combination of altered expression
of STAT4, TWIST1 and DNM3 or PLS3, could distinguish respectively 83% and 98% of 
SS patients from EID cases with 100% specificity. These additional diagnostic
panels will be useful adjuncts in the differential diagnosis of SS versus EID.

BACKGROUND: Wilms tumor (WT) has a not completely elucidated pathogenesis. DNA
copy number alterations (CNAs) are common in cancer, and often define key
pathogenic events. The aim of this work was to investigate CNAs in order to
disclose new candidate genes for Wilms tumorigenesis.
RESULTS: Array-CGH of 50 primary WTs without pre-chemotherapy revealed a few
recurrent CNAs not previously reported, such as 7q and 20q gains, and 7p loss.
Genomic amplifications were exclusively detected in 3 cases of WTs that later
relapsed, which also exhibited an increased frequency of gains affecting a
16.2 Mb 1q21.1-q23.2 region, losses at 11p, 11q distal, and 16q, and WT1
deletions. Conversely, aneuploidies of chromosomes 13 and 19 were found only in
WTs without further relapse. The 1q21.1-q23.2 gain associated with WT relapse
harbours genes such as CHD1L, CRABP2, GJA8, MEX3A and MLLT11 that were found to
be over-expressed in WTs. In addition, down-regulation of genes encompassed by
focal deletions highlighted new potential tumor suppressors such as CNKSR1,
MAN1C1, PAQR7 (1p36), TWIST1, SOSTDC1 (7p14.1-p12.2), BBOX and FIBIN (11p13), and
PLCG2 (16q).
CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the presence of CNAs previously related to WT
and characterized new CNAs found only in few cases. The later were found in
higher frequency in relapsed cases, suggesting that they could be associated with
WT progression.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling is
constantly activated in human melanoma, and promotes melanoma metastasis. The
dietary flavonoid apigenin is a bioactive compound that possesses low toxicity
and exerts anti-metastatic activity in melanoma. However, the anti-metastasis
mechanism of apigenin has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we
showed that apigenin suppressed murine melanoma B16F10 cell lung metastasis in
mice, and inhibited cell migration and invasion in human and murine melanoma
cells. Further study indicated that apigenin effectively suppressed STAT3
phosphorylation, decreased STAT3 nuclear localization and inhibited STAT3
transcriptional activity. Apigenin also down-regulated STAT3 target genes MMP-2, 
MMP-9, VEGF and Twist1, which are involved in cell migration and invasion. More
importantly, overexpression of STAT3 or Twist1 partially reversed
apigenin-impaired cell migration and invasion. Our data not only reveal a novel
anti-metastasis mechanism of apigenin but also support the notion that STAT3 is
an attractive and promising target for melanoma treatment.

BACKGROUND: Craniosynostosis is a condition that includes the premature fusion of
one or multiple cranial sutures. Among various craniosynostosis forms, sagittal
nonsyndromic craniosynostosis is the most prevalent. Although different gene
mutations have been identified in some craniosynostosis syndromes, the cause of
sagittal nonsyndromic craniosynostosis remains largely unknown.
METHODS: To screen for candidate genes for sagittal nonsyndromic
craniosynostosis, the authors sequenced DNA of 93 sagittal nonsyndromic
craniosynostosis patients from a population-based study conducted in Iowa and New
York states. FGFR1-3 mutational hotspots and the entire TWIST1, RAB23, and BMP2
coding regions were screened because of their known roles in human nonsyndromic
or syndromic sagittal craniosynostosis, expression patterns, and/or animal model 
studies.
RESULTS: The authors identified two rare variants in their cohort. A FGFR1
insertion c.730_731insG, which led to a premature stop codon, was predicted to
abolish the entire immunoglobulin-like III domain, including the ligand-binding
region. A c.439C>G variant was observed in TWIST1 at its highly conserved loop
domain in another patient. The patient's mother harbored the same variant and was
reported with jaw abnormalities. These two variants were not detected in 116
alleles from unaffected controls or seen in the several databases; however,
TWIST1 variant was found in a low frequency of 0.000831 percent in Exome
Aggregation Consortium database.
CONCLUSIONS: The low mutation detection rate indicates that these genes account
for only a small proportion of sagittal nonsyndromic craniosynostosis patients.
The authors' results add to the perception that sagittal nonsyndromic
craniosynostosis is a complex developmental defect with considerable genetic
heterogeneity.

Twist1 is an essential transcription factor required to initiate
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and promote tumor metastasis. PAQR3 is a 
newly found tumor suppressor that is frequently downregulated in many types of
human cancers. Downregulation of PAQR3 is associated with accelerated metastasis 
and poor prognosis of the patients with gastric cancers. In this study, we
demonstrate that PAQR3 is actively involved in the degradation of Twist1 and
whereby regulates EMT and metastasis of gastric cancer cells. PAQR3
overexpression reduces the protein level but not the mRNA level of Twist1. The
protein stability and polyubiquitination of Twist1 are altered by PAQR3. PAQR3
forms a complex with Twist1 and BTRC, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. PAQR3 enhances the 
interaction between Twist1 and BTRC. Twist1 is mobilized from the nucleus to a
proteasome-containing structure in the cytoplasm upon overexpression of PAQR3 and
BTRC, which is required for PAQR3-induced degradation of Twist1. The Twist1 box
domain of the Twist1 protein is required for the interaction of Twist1 with both 
PAQR3 and BTRC, indispensable for PAQR3-mediated degradation of Twist1. Both BTRC
and Twist1 are required for the inhibitory effects of PAQR3 on migration and EMT 
phenotype of gastric cancers cells. Importantly, Twist1 is indispensable for the 
inhibitory effect of PAQR3 on metastasis of gastric cancer cellsin vivo
Collectively, these findings not only pinpoint that Twist1 mediates the
modulatory function of PAQR3 on EMT and metastasis but also suggest that
targeting Twist1 is a promising strategy to control metastasis of tumors with
downregulation of PAQR3.

BACKGROUND: Cytokines are involved in cancer invasion and metastasis. Circulating
tumor cells (CTCs) play key role in tumor dissemination and are an independent
survival predictor in breast cancer patients. The aim of this study was to assess
correlation between CTCs and plasma cytokines in primary breast cancer (PBC)
patients.
METHODS: This study included 147 chemotherapy naïve PBC patients. Peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were depleted of hematopoetic cells using
RossetteSep negative selection kit. RNA extracted from CD45-depleted PBMC was
interrogated for expression of EMT (Twist1, Snail1, Slug, Zeb1) and epithelial
(Ck19) gene transcripts by qRT-PCR. The concentrations of 51 plasma cytokines
were measured using multiplex bead arrays.
RESULTS: CTCs were detected in 25.2 % patients. CTCs exhibiting only epithelial
markers (CTC_EP) and only EMT markers (CTC_EMT) were present evenly in 11.6 %
patients, while CTCs co-expressing both markers were detected in 2.0 % patients. 
Patients with presence of CTC_EP in peripheral blood had significantly elevated
levels of plasma IFN-a2, IL-3, MCP-3, ß-NGF, SCF, SCGF-ß, TNF-ß and SDF-1
compared to patients without CTC_EP. CTC_EP exhibited overexpression of SDF-1
receptor and CXCR4, but not other corresponding cytokine receptor, and in
multivariate analysis SDF-1 was independently associated with CTC_EP. There was
an inverse correlation between CTC_EMT and plasma cytokines CTACK, ß-NGF and
TRAIL, while presence of either subtype of CTCs was associated with increased
level of TGF-ß2.
CONCLUSION: Using cytokine profiling, we identified cytokines associated with
CTCs subpopulations in peripheral blood of PBC. Our data suggest that CXCR4-SDF-1
axis is involved in mobilization and trafficking of epithelial CTCs.

The development of the mammalian skull is a complex process that requires
multiple tissue interactions and a balance of growth and differentiation.
Disrupting this balance can lead to changes in the shape and size of skull bones,
which can have serious clinical implications. For example, insufficient
ossification of the bony elements leads to enlarged anterior fontanelles and
reduced mechanical protection of the brain. In this report, we find that loss of 
Gsk3ß leads to a fully penetrant reduction of frontal bone size and subsequent
enlarged frontal fontanelle. In the absence of Gsk3ß the frontal bone primordium 
undergoes increased cell death and reduced proliferation with a concomitant
increase in Fgfr2-IIIc and Twist1 expression. This leads to a smaller
condensation and premature differentiation. This phenotype appears to be
Wnt-independent and is not rescued by decreasing the genetic dose of
ß-catenin/Ctnnb1. Taken together, our work defines a novel role for Gsk3ß in
skull development.

Twist1 (also known as Twist) is a transcription factor that belongs to the family
of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins. It functions as a negative regulator
of epithelial gene expression and a positive regulator of mesenchymal gene
expression, thereby leading to induction of the epithelial mesenchymal transition
(EMT), a process in which epithelial cells acquire the motile and migratory
characteristics of mesenchymal cells. In addition to regulating the expression of
protein-coding genes, Twist1 regulates the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs),
adding a regulatory layer to EMT induction. Interestingly, the mRNA of Twist1
represents a downstream target of miRNAs, indicating an intricate network between
miRNAs and Twist1. This network was shown to play multiple roles in cancer cell
migration, invasion, and metastasis. The network can induce angiogenesis, protect
cells from oncogene-induced apoptosis and senescence, enhance cancer cell
resistance to conventional therapies, and increase cancer stem cell (CSC)
populations. Recently, miRNAs have attracted considerable attention as potential 
promising tools in cancer therapies. Thus, this systematic review was conducted
to clarify the reciprocal link between Twist1 and miRNAs in order to provide
potential candidate miRNAs for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in cancer
treatment.

Apoptotic cell clearance results in the release of growth factors and the action 
of signaling molecules involved in tissue homeostasis maintenance. Here, we
investigated whether and how macrophages programmed by apoptotic cells inhibit
the TGF-ß1-induced Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in lung
alveolar epithelial cells. Treatment with conditioned medium derived from
macrophages exposed to apoptotic cells, but not viable or necrotic cells,
inhibited TGF-ß1-induced EMT, including loss of E-cadherin, synthesis of
N-cadherin and a-smooth muscle actin, and induction of EMT-activating
transcription factors, such as Snail1/2, Zeb1/2, and Twist1. Exposure of
macrophages to cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitors (NS-398 and COX-2 siRNA) or
RhoA/Rho kinase inhibitors (Y-27632 and RhoA siRNA) and LA-4 cells to antagonists
of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor (EP4 [AH-23848]), PGD2 receptors (DP1
[BW-A868C] and DP2 [BAY-u3405]), or the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor
c-Met (PHA-665752), reversed EMT inhibition by the conditioned medium.
Additionally, we found that apoptotic cell instillation inhibited
bleomycin-mediated EMT in primary mouse alveolar type II epithelial cells in
vivo. Our data suggest a new model for epithelial cell homeostasis, by which the 
anti-EMT programming of macrophages by apoptotic cells may control the
progressive fibrotic reaction via the production of potent paracrine EMT
inhibitors.

It has been suggested that multipotent stem cells with neural crest (NC) origin
persist into adulthood in oral mucosa. However their exact localization and role 
in normal homeostasis is unknown. In this study, we discovered that Lgr5 is
expressed in NC cells during embryonic development, which give rise to the
dormant stem cells in the adult tongue and oral mucosa. Those Lgr5 positive oral 
stromal stem cells display properties of NC stem cells including clonal growth
and multipotent differentiation. RNA sequencing revealed that adult Lgr5+ oral
stromal stem cells express high number of neural crest related markers like Sox9,
Twist1, Snai1, Myc, Ets1, Crabp1, Epha2, and Itgb1. Using lineage-tracing
experiments, we show that these cells persist more than a year in the ventral
tongue and some areas of the oral mucosa and give rise to stromal progeny. In
vivo transplantation demonstrated that these cells reconstitute the stroma. Our
studies show for the first time that Lgr5 is expressed in the NC cells at
embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) and is maintained during embryonic development and
postnataly in the stroma of the ventral tongue, and some areas of the oral mucosa
and that Lgr5+ cells participate in the maintenance of the stroma. Stem Cells

BACKGROUND: Leucine-rich-alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) has been reported to be
involved in several tumors, whether it participates in colorectal cancer (CRC)
progression remains unclear. Here, we investigated the biological function and
underlying molecular mechanisms of LRG1 in CRC.
METHODS: The mRNA and protein levels of LRG1 were assessed in CRC tissues through
RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. HCT116 and SW480 cells were
treated with LRG1 siRNA, control siRNA, or recombinant LRG1. Transwell invasion
assays and wound healing assays were performed to evaluate the invasion and
migration of CRC cells. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers of
E-cadherin, VDR, N-cadherin, a-SMA, Vimentin and Twist1 were detected by RT-PCR
and western blot. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the
secretion level of VEGF-A. Conditioned medium from CRC cells was collected for
endothelial cell migration, tube formation and aortic ring sprouting assays.
RESULTS: LRG1 was overexpressed in CRC tissues and associated with cancer
aggressiveness. LRG1 was further found to induce the EMT process, as well as CRC 
cell migration and invasion capacity. In addition, LRG1 promoted VEGF-A
expression in CRC cells and contributed to tumor angiogenesis. Furthermore,
HIF-1a could be induced by LRG1 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner,
which was responsible for LRG1-induced VEGF-A expression and EMT.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that LRG1 plays a crucial role in the
progression of CRC by regulating HIF-1a expression, thereby may be a promising
therapeutic target of CRC.

The use of tetraspanin CD9 as a biomarker for renal cell carcinomas (RCC) has
been explored with minor conclusions. Identification of a biomarker that not only
distinguishes between the different types of renal cell carcinomas, but also
predicts the metastatic potential of these tumors would significantly advance
diagnosis and prognosis of kidney cancers. We utilized established cell lines to 
better understand the contribution of CD9 to the metastatic potential of clear
cell renal cell carcinomas, and then applied our findings to the TCGA database
and immunohistochemical analysis of human samples based on tumor grading to
determine the utility of CD9 as a biomarker for RCC. Clear cell renal cell
carcinoma (ccRCC) cell expression of tetraspanin CD9 was compared to normal
kidney cells and found to be elevated. Upon knockdown of CD9, ccRCC cells
obtained a more metastatic phenotype. We found E-cadherin expression to be
repressed and the endothelial to mesenchymal transition markers Snail, Twist1,
and Zeb1 to be elevated upon CD9 knockdown. Upon observing these gene expression 
changes in the TCGA database and in 10 cases, we found that CD9 and E-cadherin
expression was lowered in higher grade ccRCC tumors. There was a significant
correlation between CD9 and either E-cadherin, Snail, or Zeb1 in these tumors.
Collectively, using tetraspanin CD9 in tandem with E-cadherin as a biomarker in
renal cell carcinoma will help to not only distinguish between types, but also
predict the metastatic potential of RCC.

BACKGROUND: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a dedifferentiation
process that mainly involves in mesenchymal marker upregulation, epithelial maker
downregulation and cell polarity loss. Related hypoxia factors play a crucial
role in EMT, however, it remains few evidence to clarify the role of HIF-2a in
EMT in pancreatic cancer.
METHOD: In this study, we investigated the expression of HIF-2a and E-cadherin by
immunohistochemistry in 70 pancreatic cancer patients, as well as the correlation
to the clinicopathologic characteristics. Then we regulated the expression of
HIF-2a in pancreatic cancer cells to examine the role of HIF-2a on invasion and
migration in vitro. Finally, we tested the relation of HIF-2a and EMT related
proteins by Western blot and determined whether HIF-2a regulated EMT through
Twist regulating the expression of E-cadherin by Chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assay.
RESULTS: We found that HIF-2a protein was expressed positively in 67.1 % (47/70) 
of pancreatic cancer tissues and 11.4 % (8/70) of adjacent non-tumor pancreatic
tissues, and there was a significant difference in the positive rate of HIF-2a
protein between two groups (<U+03C7>2<U+2009>=<U+2009>45.549, P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05). In addition, the staining for
HIF-2a was correlated with tumor differentiation (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05), clinical stage
(P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) and lymph node metastasis (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05), while E-cadherin expression was 
only correlated with lymph node metastasis (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05). HIF-2a promoted cell
migration, invasion in vitro, and regulated the expression of E-cadherin and
MMPs, which are critical to EMT. Our further ChIP assay suggested that only
Twist2 could bind to the promoter of E-cadherin in -714 bp region site, but there
is no positive binding capacity in -295 bp promoter region site of E-cadherin.
Clinical tissues IHC staining showed that Twist2 and E-cadherin expression had an
obviously negative correlation in pancreatic cancer. Nevertheless, it had no
obvious correlation between Twist1 and E-cadherin.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that HIF-2a promotes EMT in pancreatic
cancer by regulating Twist2 binding to the promoter of E-cadherin, which meant
that HIF-2a and this pathway may be effective therapeutic targets for pancreatic 
cancer.

Inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-inducing transcription
factors Twist and Snail prevents tumor metastasis but enhances metastatic growth.
Here, we report an unexpected role of a tumor suppressor tristetraprolin (TTP) in
inhibiting Twist and Snail without enhancing cellular proliferation. TTP bound to
the AU-rich element (ARE) within the mRNA 3'UTRs of Twist1 and Snail1, enhanced
the decay of their mRNAs and inhibited the EMT of cancer cells. The ectopic
expression of Twist1 or Snail1 without their 3'UTRs blocked the inhibitory
effects of TTP on the EMT. We also observed that TTP overexpression suppressed
the growth of cancer cells. Our data propose a new model whereby TTP
down-regulates Twist1 and Snail1 and inhibits both the EMT and the proliferation 
of cancer cells.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical process for inducing
stem-like properties of epithelial cancer cells. However, the role of EMT
inducers in hematological malignancies is unknown. Twist1, an EMT inducer
necessary for cell migration, has recently been found to have transcriptionally
regulatory activity on the expression of Bmi1, and these two are capable of
promoting tumorigenesis in a synergized manner. Knowing that Bmi1 expression is
essential for maintenance of leukemic stem cells, we speculate that Twist1 might 
govern the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) development as well. We
found that upregulated Twist1 increased Bmi1 expression in AML and endued
leukemic cells a higher proliferative potential and increased resistance to
apoptosis. In primary AML samples, there was strong positive correlation between 
the expression levels of Twist1 and Bmi1. AML patients whose leukemic blasts
harbored overexpressed Twist1 had a more aggressive clinical phenotype, but they 
were more likely to have a better clinical outcome after standard therapy. In
vitro studies confirmed that Twist1-overexpressing leukemic cells were more
susceptible to cytarabine, but not daunorubicin, cytotoxicity. Our findings
suggest that, in a subset of AML patients, Twist1 has a prominent role in the
pathogenesis of the disease that leads to unique clinical phenotypes.

Tumor hypoxia is associated with malignant biological phenotype including
enhanced angiogenesis and metastasis. Hypoxia increases the expression of
vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF), which directly participates in
angiogenesis by recruiting endothelial cells into hypoxic area and stimulating
their proliferation, for increasing vascular density. Recent research in tumor
biology has focused on the model in which tumor-derived endothelial cells arise
from tumor stem-like cells, but the detailed mechanism is not clear. Twist1, an
important regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), has been shown to
mediate tumor metastasis and induce tumor angiogenesis. Notch signaling has been 
demonstrated to be an important player in vascular development and tumor
angiogenesis. KLF4 (Krüppel-like factor 4) is a factor commonly used for the
generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. KLF4 also plays an important 
role in the differentiation of endothelial cells. Although Twist1 is known as a
master regulator of mesoderm development, it is unknown whether Twist1 could be
involved in endothelial transdifferentiation of tumor-derived cells. This review 
focuses on the role of Twist1-Jagged1/Notch-KLF4 axis on tumor-derived
endothelial transdifferentiation, tumorigenesis, metastasis, and cancer stemness.

The effects of Notch signaling are context-dependent and both oncogenic and
tumor-suppressive functions have been described. Notch signaling in melanoma is
considered oncogenic, but clinical trials testing Notch inhibition in this
malignancy have not proved successful. Here, we report that expression of the
constitutively active intracellular domain of Notch4 (N4ICD) in melanoma cells
triggered a switch from a mesenchymal-like parental phenotype to an
epithelial-like phenotype. The epithelial-like morphology was accompanied by
strongly reduced invasive, migratory, and proliferative properties concomitant
with the downregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers Snail2
(SNAI2), Twist1, vimentin (VIM), and MMP2 and the reexpression of E-cadherin
(CDH1). The N4ICD-induced phenotypic switch also resulted in significantly
reduced tumor growth in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis of primary human
melanomas and cutaneous metastases revealed a significant correlation between
Notch4 and E-cadherin expression. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that N4ICD
induced the expression of the transcription factors Hey1 and Hey2, which bound
directly to the promoter regions of Snail2 and Twist1 and repressed gene
transcription, as determined by EMSA and luciferase assays. Taken together, our
findings indicate a role for Notch4 as a tumor suppressor in melanoma, uncovering
a potential explanation for the poor clinical efficacy of Notch inhibitors
observed in this setting. Cancer Res; 76(7); 1-8. ©2016 AACR.

Exosomes are 30-150nM membrane-bound secreted vesicles that are readily isolated 
from biological fluids such as urine (UEs). Exosomes contain proteins, micro RNA 
(miRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) from their cells 
of origin. Although miRNA, protein and lncRNA have been isolated from serum as
potential biomarkers for benign and malignant disease, it is unknown if lncRNAs
in UEs from urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) patients can serve as biomarkers.
lncRNAs are > 200 nucleotide long transcripts that do not encode protein and play
critical roles in tumor biology. As the number of recognized tumor-associated
lncRNAs continues to increase, there is a parallel need to include lncRNAs into
biomarker discovery and therapeutic target algorithms. The lncRNA HOX transcript 
antisense RNA (HOTAIR) has been shown to facilitate tumor initiation and
progression and is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers. The
importance of HOTAIR in cancer biology has sparked interest in using HOTAIR as a 
biomarker and potential therapeutic target. Here we show HOTAIR and several
tumor-associated lncRNAs are enriched in UEs from UBC patients with high-grade
muscle-invasive disease (HGMI pT2-pT4). Knockdown of HOTAIR in UBC cell lines
reduces in vitro migration and invasion. Importantly, loss of HOTAIR expression
in UBC cell lines alters expression of epithelial-to-mesenchyme transition (EMT) 
genes including SNAI1, TWIST1, ZEB1, ZO1, MMP1 LAMB3, and LAMC2. Finally, we used
RNA-sequencing to identify four additional lncRNAs enriched in UBC patient UEs.
These data, suggest that UE-derived lncRNA may potentially serve as biomarkers
and therapeutic targets.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: In this study, we investigated the role of salt-inducible
kinase 1 (SIK1) and the its possible mechanisms in human hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC).
METHODS: Immunoprecipitation, immunohistochemistry, luciferase reporter,
Chromatin immunoprecipitation, in vitro kinase assays and a mouse model were used
to examine the role of SIK1 on the ß-catenin signaling pathway.
RESULTS: SIK1 was significantly downregulated in HCC compared with normal
controls. Its introduction in HCC cells markedly suppresses
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), tumor growth and lung metastasis in
xenograft tumor models. The effect of SIK1 on tumor development occurs at least
partially through regulation of ß-catenin, as evidenced by the fact that SIK1
overexpression leads to repression of ß-catenin transcriptional activity, while
SIK1 depletion has the opposite effect. Mechanistically, SIK1 phosphorylates the 
silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) at
threonine (T)1391, which promotes the association of nuclear receptor corepressor
(NCoR)/SMRT with transducin-beta-like protein 1 (TBL1)/transducing-beta-like 1
X-linked receptor 1 (TBLR1) and disrupts the binding of ß-catenin to the
TBL1/TBLR1 complex, thereby inactivating the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway. However,
SMRT-T1391A reverses the phenotype of SIK1 and promotes ß-catenin
transactivation. Twist1 is identified as a critical factor downstream of
SIK1/ß-catenin axis, and Twist1 knockdown (Twist1(KD)) reverses SIK1(KD)-mediated
changes, whereas SIK1(KD)/Twist1(KD) double knockdown cells were less efficient
in establishing tumor growth and metastasis than SIK1(KD) cells. The promoter
activity of SIK1 were negatively regulated by Twist1, indicating that a
double-negative feedback loop exists. Importantly, levels of SIK1 inversely
correlate with Twist1 expression in human HCC specimens.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the critical roles of SIK1 and its targets in
the regulation of HCC development and provides potential new candidates for HCC
therapy.

BACKGROUND: The objective was to assess histopathological changes and the
expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Bcl-2, suppressor of
cytokine signaling (SOCS) 1 and 3, Vimentin, TWIST1, and Cdh 1 and 2 in early
stages of experimental oral carcinogenesis process using a shorter period of
exposure to 4-nitroquinoline oxide (4-NQO) model.
METHODS: In this study, 20 rats were divided into control group (n = 10),
sacrificed on the first day of the experiment, and experimental group (n = 10)
treated with 50 ppm of 4-NQO solution dissolved in drinking water for 8 and 12
weeks. The histological sections were stained with H&E or subjected to
immunohistochemistry for detecting PCNA, Bcl-2, SOCS 1 and 3, and STAT 3. Some
specimens were used for verification of Vimentin expression, Cdh 1, Cdh 2, and
TWIST1 by RT-qPCR.
RESULTS: At both 8 and 12 weeks, morphological changes occurred mainly in the
posterior portion of the tongue and were limited to the epithelial tissue,
including moderate to severe dysplasia at 8 weeks, and severe dysplasia with
exacerbation of atypical cells at 12 weeks. Expression of SOCS 1 and 3 increased 
from 8 to 12 weeks (P < 0.05), whereas STAT 3 expression was reduced mainly at 12
weeks (P < 0.05) in comparison with the control group. The expression of all
epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers (EMT) was increased after 12 weeks,
reaching statistical significance (P < 0.05) for Cdh 1 and 2.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, the results suggested that overexpression of Bcl-2, SOCS 1
and 3, and Cdh 1 and 2 is associated with the early neoplasic changes in modified
4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide-induced murine oral cancer model.

The aim of the study was to investigate the expression of epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT)-inducing transcription factors, including Twist1 and
ZEB1, in skeletal extramedullary disease (EMD) of multiple myeloma (MM) patients 
and to clarify the effects on clinical outcomes. The expression of Twist1 and
ZEB1 in the bone marrow (BM) and the masses of skeletal EMD from 70 MM cases with
skeletal EMD and 30 MM patients without skeletal EMD were determined by
immunohistochemistry. The results demonstrated that the percentage of high
nuclear staining for Twist1 was 24.3% (17/70) in skeletal EMD, which was
significantly higher than in the BM of these patients as well as those without
skeletal EMD (P=0.030 and P=0.011). The microvessel density (MVD, P=0.004) was
significantly higher in patients with high nuclear expression of Twist1
(Twist1-high) than in those with low expression. Patients with Twist1-high
experienced a lower rate of progression-free survival (PFS, 11.8% vs. 35.0%,
P=0.000) and overall survival (OS, 52.5% vs. 83.7%, P=0.001) compared to those
with low expression. Multivariate analysis showed that Twist1-high was
independently associated with inferior PFS (HR=2.161; 95%CI: 1.116-4.183;
P=0.022) and OS (HR=3.111; 95%CI: 1.114-8.685; P=0.030). We concluded that
Twist1-high is associated with a poor prognosis and may be correlated with
angiogenesis in the skeletal EMD of MM patients.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the underlying mechanism of tumor
invasion and metastasis. Evidences from lung cancer cellular models show EMT can 
trigger conversion to a cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype. In this study, we
assessed mRNA expression levels of EMT-inducing transcription factors (BMI1,
TWIST1), CSC (CD133, ALDH1A1), and epithelial (EpCAM) markers in primary tumor
and whole blood samples obtained from 57 patients with operable non-small-cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) as well as in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) of 13 patients
with metastatic disease; then possible associations between marker expressions
were evaluated. In primary tumors as well as in whole blood, correlations between
BMI1 and ALDH1A1 and between BMI1 and CD133 mRNA expressions were identified. No 
correlations between TWIST1 and CSC markers were observed. BMI1 mRNA expression
in tumors positively correlated with BMI1 mRNA expression in blood. The
immunohistochemical analysis confirmed coexpression of BMI1 and CSC markers in
tumors. Gene expression profiling in CTCs revealed upregulated expression of
EMT/CSC markers in CTCs. Our results suggest CSCs are present in both, tumor
tissue and blood of NSCLC patients, whereas Bmi1 may play an important role in
initiation and maintenance of CSCs and might be involved in the blood-borne
dissemination of NSCLC.

Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)(1) occurs naturally during
embryogenesis, tissue repair, cancer progression, and metastasis. EMT induces
cellular and microenvironmental changes resulting in loss of epithelial and
acquisition of mesenchymal phenotypes, which promotes cellular invasive and
migratory capabilities. EMT can be triggered by extracellular factors, including 
TGF-ß, HGF, and EGF. Overexpression of transcription factors, such as SNAIL,
SLUG, ZEB1/2, and TWIST1, also induces EMT and is correlated to cancer
aggressiveness. Here, the breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF7 was transduced
with SNAIL to identify specific mechanisms controlled by this transcription
factor during EMT. Overexpression of SNAIL led to EMT, which was thoroughly
validated by molecular, morphological, and functional experiments. Subcellular
proteome enrichment followed by GEL-LC-MS/MS was performed to provide extensive
protein fractionation and in-depth proteomic analysis. Quantitative analysis
relied on a SILAC strategy, using the invasive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231
as a reference for quantitation. Subsets of proteins enriched in each subcellular
compartment led to a complementary list of 4289 proteins identified with high
confidence. A subset of differentially expressed proteins was validated by
Western blot, including regulation in specific cellular compartments, potentially
caused by protein translocation. Protein network analysis highlighted complexes
involved in cell cycle control and epigenetic regulation. Flow cytometry analysis
indicated that SNAIL overexpression led to cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phases.
Furthermore, down-regulation of HDAC1 was observed, supporting the involvement of
epigenetic processes in SNAIL-induced EMT. When HDAC1 activity was inhibited,
MCF7 not only apparently initiated EMT but also up-regulated SNAIL, indicating
the cross-talk between these two proteins. Both HDAC1 inhibition and SNAIL
overexpression activated the AKT pathway. These molecular mechanisms appear to be
essential to EMT and therefore for cancer metastasis. Specific control of such
epigenetic processes might then represent effective approaches for clinical
management of metastatic cancer.

BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs, which
post-transcriptionally repress the expression of genes involved in cancer
initiation and progression. Although some miRNAs that target many signaling
pathways (also called universe miRNAs) are supposed to play a global role in
diverse human tumors, their regulatory functions in gynecological cancers remain 
largely unknown. We investigated the biological role and underlying mechanism of 
miR-548c (one universe miRNA) in endometrial and ovarian cancer.
METHODS: The effects of miR-548c overexpression on cell proliferation, migration 
and invasion were studied in endometrial and ovarian cancer cells. TWIST1 (Twist)
was identified as a direct miR-548c target by western blot analysis and
luciferase activity assay. The expression of miR-548c and Twist were examined by 
qRT-PCR in endometrial and ovarian cancer tissues.
RESULTS: Here, we report that miR-548c is down-regulated in endometrial and
ovarian cancer tissues when compared to normal tissues, and our meta-analysis
reveal that decreased miR-548c expression correlates with poor prognosis in
endometrial cancer patients. We show that in endometrial and ovarian cancer
cells, ectopic expression of miR-548c significantly inhibits whereas knockdown of
miR-548c dramatically induces cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. 
By using luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrate that Twist, a known oncogene
in endometrial and ovarian cancers, is a direct target of miR-548c. Furthermore, 
the expression of Twist partially abrogates the tumor suppressive effects of
miR-548c on cell migration and invasion.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that miR-548c directly downregulates Twist,
and provide a novel mechanism for Twist upregulation in both endometrial and
ovarian cancers. The use of miR-548c may hold therapeutic potential for the
treatment of Twist-overexpressing tumors.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an essential physiologic process
that promotes cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Several lines of
evidence from both cellular and genetic studies suggest that AKT1/PKBa, but not
AKT2 or AKT3, serves as a negative regulator of EMT and breast cancer metastasis.
However, the underlying mechanism by which AKT1 suppresses EMT remains poorly
defined. Here, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Twist1 by AKT1 is required 
for ß-TrCP-mediated Twist1 ubiquitination and degradation. The clinically used
AKT inhibitor MK-2206, which possesses higher specificity toward AKT1, stabilized
Twist1 and enhanced EMT in breast cancer cells. However, we discovered that
resveratrol, a naturally occurring compound, induced ß-TrCP-mediated Twist1
degradation to attenuate MK-2206-induced EMT in breast cancer cells. Taken
together, our findings demonstrate that resveratrol counteracts the unexpected
metastatic potential induced by anti-AKT therapy and therefore suggest that the
addition of resveratrol to an anti-AKT therapeutic regimen may provide extra
support for limiting EMT. Cancer Res; 76(6); 1451-62. ©2016 AACR.

BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors are often
therapy resistant and may originate from cancer stem cells or tumor cells with an
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. The aim of this study was
to characterize HNSCC cell lines with regard to EMT profile and to investigate
the influence of EMT on the response to treatment.
METHODS: mRNA expression of the EMT-associated genes CDH1 (E-cadherin), CDH2
(N-cadherin), FOXC2, TWIST1, VIM (vimentin), and FN1 (fibronectin) was determined
using quantitative real-time PCR. Cell morphology and migration were investigated
by phase-contrast microscopy and Boyden chamber assay, respectively. The cell
surface expression of CD44 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was
examined by flow cytometry. The response to radiotherapy, cetuximab, and
dasatinib was assessed by crystal violet staining.
RESULTS: A total of 25 cell lines investigated differed greatly with regard to
EMT phenotype. Cell lines with an EMT expression profile showed a mesenchymal
morphology and a high migratory capacity. In addition, they exhibited a high cell
surface expression of CD44 and a low expression of EGFR, a pattern previously
associated with stemness. When the EMT inducer transforming growth factor-ß
(TGF-ß) was added to non-EMT cells, changes in treatment responses were observed.
Moreover, the expression of TWIST1 was found to correlate with radioresistance.
CONCLUSIONS: The data presented in this report suggest that EMT is associated
with a CD44(high) /EGFR(low) phenotype and possibly negative impact on
radiotherapy response in HNSCC cell lines.

Neural crest (NC)-derived stem cells (NCSC) have an exceptionally wide
differentiation potential, but their use in regenerative therapy has been
hampered by their scarcity in adult tissues and complex isolation protocols.
Human oral mucosal gingiva may provide an attractive source of these cells as it 
contains NC-derived cells, the tissue is easily accessible and wound healing is
fast and scarless with very little morbidity. To this end, we first investigated 
whether NC-derived cells are retained in adult gingiva by examining 8-months-old 
NC-reporter Wnt1-Cre/R26RYFP mice. We then hypothesised that gingival cell
NC-like phenotype can be further enhanced by floating neurosphere cultures
generated from standard human gingival fibroblast (GF) and pooled CFU-F (GSC)
cultures. Findings showed that NC-derived cells are retained in the gingival
connective tissue of aged mice. Human GFs and GSCs expressed NC-related genes
nestin, Snai1, Twist1, Pax3, Sox9 and FoxD3, and generated neurospheres. This was
mediated via calcium- and connexin 43-dependent cell communication, which is
similar to neurospheres formed by neural progenitors. Cells in the spheres showed
significantly increased expression of NC-related genes, and down regulation of
fibroblast-related type I collagen. Structurally, the neurospheres were polarised
with nestin positive cells located on the outer layers underlined with an
extracellular matrix rich in molecules typical to embryonic NC. Sphere-derived
cells expressed significantly elevated levels of neural markers, and
differentiated into Tau, neurofilament-M and GFAP-positive cells suggesting
neural differentiation potential. Thus, human GF and GSC cultures may provide an 
efficient source of NC-derived cells via enrichment by floating sphere cultures.

Twist-related protein 1 (Twist1), is a class II basic helix-loop-helix
transcription factor, which has been demonstrated to be a major regulator of
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and therefore is involved in promoting
carcinoma metastasis. Previous studies have demonstrated that Twist1 expression
is upregulated in cervical cancer cases with poor clinical outcomes. However, the
mechanisms that mediate the role of Twist1 in cervical cancer metastasis are
poorly understood. To the best of our knowledge, the present study provides the
first evidence that the downregulation of Twist1 by short hairpin RNA lentivirus 
(LV-shRNA) resulted in the inhibition of invasion and migration of cervical
cancer cells. Furthermore, the present study presents evidence that reducing
Twist1 expression prevents cervical cancer cells from undergoing EMT. The
expression of the epithelial cell marker, E-cadherin, was elevated; and the
expression levels of mesenchymal cell markers [fibronectin, vimentin, matrix
metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and MMP-2] were reduced in the LV-sh-Twist1 group in 
cervical cells. Collectively, these findings indicate that Twist1-mediated
modulation of EMT is important in the invasion and migration of cervical cells,
and also indicates the potential therapeutic importance of strategies involving
the inactivation of Twist1-mediated mesenchymal changes in cervical cancer.

Inhibition of sclerostin with sclerostin antibody (Scl-Ab) has been shown to
stimulate bone formation, decrease bone resorption, and increase bone mass in
both animals and humans. To obtain insight into the temporal cellular and
transcriptional changes in the osteoblast (OB) lineage associated with long-term 
Scl-Ab treatment, stereological and transcriptional analyses of the OB lineage
were performed on lumbar vertebrae from aged ovariectomized rats. Animals were
administered Scl-Ab 3 or 50mg/kg/wk or vehicle (VEH) for up to 26weeks (d183),
followed by a treatment-free period (TFP). At 50mg/kg/wk, bone volume (BV/total
volume [TV]) increased through d183 and declined during the TFP. Bone formation
rate (BFR/bone surface [BS]) and total OB number increased through d29, then
progressively declined, coincident with a decrease in total osteoprogenitor (OP) 
numbers from d29 through d183. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
from microarray analysis of mRNA isolated from laser capture microdissection
samples enriched for OB, lining cells, and osteocytes (OCy) revealed modules of
genes that correlated with BFR/BS, BV/TV, and osteoblastic surface (Ob.S)/BS.
Expression change of canonical Wnt target genes was similar in all three cell
types at d8, including upregulation of Twist1 and Wisp1. At d29, the pattern of
Wnt target gene expression changed in the OCy, with Twist1 returning to VEH
level, sustained upregulation of Wisp1, and upregulation of several other Wnt
targets that continued into the TFP. Predicted activation of pathways recognized 
to integrate with and regulate canonical Wnt signaling were also activated at d29
in the OCy. The most significantly affected pathways represented transcription
factor signaling known to inhibit cell cycle progression (notably p53) and
mitogenesis (notably c-Myc). These changes occurred at the time of peak BFR/BS
and continued as BFR/BS declined during treatment, then trended toward VEH level 
in the TFP. Concurrent with this transcriptional switch was a reduction in OP
numbers, an effect that would ultimately limit bone formation. This study
confirms that the initial transcriptional response in response to Scl-Ab is
activation of canonical Wnt signaling and the data demonstrate that there is
induction of additional regulatory pathways in OCy with long-term treatment. The 
interactions between Wnt and p53/c-Myc signaling may be key in limiting OP
populations, thus contributing to self-regulation of bone formation with
continued Scl-Ab administration.

Skin tumor susceptibility 5 (Skts5) was previously mapped to mouse chromosome 12 
through linkage analysis of skin tumor susceptible Mus musculus (NIH/Ola-S) and
skin tumor resistant outbred Mus spretus (SPRET/Out-R) mice. Hdac9 was identified
as a potential candidate for Skts5 based on conserved non-synonymous sequence
variants and expression analyses. Studies by others identified an enhancer in
human HDAC9 that correlated with TWIST1 expression. We identified 45 sequence
variants between NIH/Ola-S and SPRET/Out-R mice from the orthologous region of
the human HDAC9 enhancer. Variants mapping to intron 18 differentially affected
luciferase expression in vitro. NIH/Ola-S clones showed an approximate 1.7-fold
increased luciferase expression relative to vector alone or the equivalent clones
from SPRET/Out-R-R. Furthermore, cells transfected with a portion of the
NIH/Ola-S intron induced 2.2-fold increases in Twist1 expression, but the same
region from SPRET/Out-R mice resulted in no up-regulation of Twist1. In silico
transcription factor analyses identified multiple transcription factors predicted
to differentially bind NIH/Ola-S and SPRET/Out-R polymorphic sites. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation studies of two transcription factors, Gata3 and Oct1,
demonstrated differential binding between NIH/Ola-S and SPRET/Out-R plasmids that
corroborated the in silico predictions. Together these studies provide evidence
that the murine orthologous region to a human HDAC9 enhancer also acts as a
transcriptional enhancer for mouse Twist1. As ectopic sequence variants between
NIH/Ola-S and SPRET/Out-R differentially impacted luciferase expression,
correlated with Twist1 expression in vitro, and affected Gata3 and Oct1 binding, 
these variants may explain part of the observed differences in skin tumor
susceptibility at Skts5 between NIH/Ola-S and SPRET/Out-R.

We have previously shown that complement component 3 (C3) is secreted by
malignant epithelial cells. To understand the mechanism of upregulation of C3
expression in tumor cells, we studied the C3 promoter and identified that twist
basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor 1 (TWIST1) binds to the C3 promoter
and enhances its expression. Because TWIST1 mediates epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), we studied the effect of C3 on EMT and found that C3 decreased 
E-cadherin expression on cancer cells and promoted EMT. We showed that C3-induced
reduction in E-cadherin expression in ovarian cancer cells was mediated by C3a
and is Krüppel-like factor 5 dependent. We investigated the association between
TWIST1 and C3 in malignant tumors and in murine embryos. TWIST1 and C3
colocalized at the invasive tumor edges, and in the neural crest and limb buds of
mouse embryos. Our results identified TWIST1 as a transcription factor that
regulates C3 expression during pathologic and physiologic EMT.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinicopathological significance of Twist and YB-1 
up-regulation in cervical cancer, and to correlate the expression of the two
genes with E-cadherin, a marker of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
METHODS: A total of 202 tissue samples were collected during January 2008 to
December 2013, including 50 cases of normal cervical tissues, 100 cases of
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and 52 cases of squamous cell carcinoma 
(SCC). Twist, YB-1 and E-cadherin expression was investigated by MaxVision.
RESULTS: Increased expression levels of Twist and YB-1 were found and correlated 
with the malignant transformation of cervical epithelium, histological
progression and metastasis of cervical cancer. In addition, Twist and YB-1
overexpression was also associated with aberrant expression of E-cadherin.
Regression analysis revealed that Twist expression was an independent factor for 
the histological progression of cervical cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that Twist and YB-1 overexpression is significantly 
linked to cervical cancer tumorigenesis and progression, likely related to EMT
through (YB-1)-Twist-(E-cadherin) pathway. Twist and YB-1 may be markers for
determining the metastatic potential of cervical cancer.

Administration of bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) reduces
lung inflammation, fibrosis, and mortality in animal models of lung injury, by a 
mechanism not completely understood. We investigated whether hMSC would prevent
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by hypoxia in primary rat
alveolar epithelial cell (AEC). In AEC cultured on semipermeable filters,
prolonged hypoxic exposure (1.5% O2 for up to 12 days) induced phenotypic changes
consistent with EMT, i.e., a change in cell morphology, a decrease in
transepithelial resistance (Rte) and in the expression of epithelial markers
[zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), E-cadherin, AQP-5, TTF-1], together with an increase 
in mesenchymal markers [vimentin, a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA)]. Expression of
transcription factors driving EMT such as SNAIL1, ZEB1, and TWIST1 increased
after 2, 24, and 48 h of hypoxia, respectively. Hypoxia also induced TGF-ß1 mRNA 
expression and the secretion of active TGF-ß1 in apical medium, and the
expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), two inducers of EMT.
Coculture of AEC with hMSC partially prevented the decrease in Rte and in ZO-1,
E-cadherin, and TTF-1 expression, and the increase in vimentin expression induced
by hypoxia. It also abolished the increase in TGF-ß1 expression and in
TGF-ß1-induced genes ZEB1, TWIST1, and CTGF. Finally, incubation with human
recombinant KGF at a concentration similar to what was measured in
hMSC-conditioned media restored the expression of TTF-1 and prevented the
increase in TWIST1, TGF-ß1, and CTGF in hypoxic AEC. Our results indicate that
hMSC prevent hypoxia-induced alveolar EMT through the paracrine modulation of EMT
signaling pathways and suggest that this effect is partly mediated by KGF.

Twist1 overexpression is frequently observed in various cancers including gastric
cancer (GC). Although DNA methylation of the Twist1 gene has been reported in
cancer cells, the mechanisms underlying transcriptional activation remain
uncertain. In this study, we first examined epigenetic alterations of the Twist1 
using Twist1 transcription-positive and -negative cell lines that are derived
from our established diffuse-type GC mouse model. Treatment with a DNA
demethylation agent 5-aza-dC re-activated Twist1 expression in Twist1
expression-negative GC cells. According to methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite
sequencing analysis, methylation at the CpG-rich region within Twist1 coding exon
1, rather than its promoter region, was tightly linked to transcriptional
silencing of the Twist1 expression in mouse GC cells. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays revealed that active histone mark H3K4me3 was enriched
in Twist1 expression-positive cells, and inactive histone mark H3K9me3 was
enriched in Twist1 expression-negative cells. The expression levels of Suv39h1
and Suv39h2, histone methyltransferases for H3K9me3, were inversely correlated
with Twist1 expression, and knockdown of Suv39h1 or Suv39h2 induced Twist1
expression. Moreover, Sp1 transcription factor bound to the exon 1 CpG-rich
region in Twist1 expression-positive cell lines, and Twist1 expression was
diminished by mithramycin, which that interferes with Sp1 binding to CpG-rich
regulatory sequences. Our studies suggested that the Twist1 transcription in GC
cells might be regulated through potential cooperation of DNA methylation,
histone modification in complex with Sp1 binding to CpG-rich regions within the
exon 1 region.

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the leading cause of cancer-related 
death worldwide. Previous studies have suggested that DNA methylation involved in
the development of ESCC. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the
regulation and maintenance of the methylome as well as their relationship with
ESCC remain poorly understood. Herein, we used methylated DNA immunoprecipitation
sequencing (MeDIP-Seq) and RNA-Seq to investigate whole-genome DNA methylation
patterns and the genome expression profiles in ESCC samples. The results of
MeDIP-Seq analyses identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) covering
almost the entire genome with sufficient depth and high resolution. The gene
ontology (GO) analysis showed that the DMRs related genes belonged to several
different ontological domains, such as cell cycle, adhesion, proliferation and
apoptosis. The RNA-Seq analysis identified a total of 6150 differentially
expressed genes (3423 up-regulated and 2727 down-regulated). The significant GO
terms showed that these genes belonged to several molecular functions and
biological pathways. Moreover, the bisulfite-sequencing of genes MLH1, CDH5,
TWIST1 and CDX1 confirmed the methylation status identified by MeDIP-Seq. And the
mRNA expression levels of MLH1, TWIST1 and CDX1 were consistent with their DNA
methylation profiles. The DMR region of MLH1 was found to correlate with
survival. The identification of whole-genome DNA methylation patterns and gene
expression profiles in ESCC provides new insight into the carcinogenesis of ESCC 
and represents a promising avenue through which to investigate novel therapeutic

BACKGROUND: Specification of cranial bone and dermal fibroblast progenitors in
the supraorbital arch mesenchyme is Wnt/ß-catenin signaling-dependent. The
mechanism underlying how these cells interpret instructive signaling cues and
differentiate into these two lineages is unclear. Twist1 is a target of the
Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway and is expressed in cranial bone and dermal
lineages.
RESULTS: Here, we show that onset of Twist1 expression in the mouse cranial
mesenchyme is dependent on ectodermal Wnts and mesenchymal ß-catenin activity.
Conditional deletion of Twist1 in the supraorbital arch mesenchyme leads to
cranial bone agenesis and hypoplastic dermis, as well as craniofacial
malformation of eyes and palate. Twist1 is preferentially required for cranial
bone lineage commitment by maintaining Wnt responsiveness. In the conditional
absence of Twist1, the cranial dermis fails to condense and expand apically
leading to extensive cranial dermal hypoplasia with few and undifferentiated hair
follicles.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, Twist1, a target of canonical Wnt/ß-catenin signaling, also
functions to maintain Wnt responsiveness and is a key effector for cranial bone
fate selection and dermal condensation. Developmental Dynamics 245:144-156, 2016.

BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoke, diet and indoor/outdoor air pollution, all major
sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), have been associated with
breast cancer. Aberrant methylation may be an early event in carcinogenesis, but 
whether PAHs influence the epigenome is unclear, particularly in breast tissue
where methylation may be most relevant. We aimed to evaluate the role of
methylation in the association between PAHs and breast cancer.
METHODS: In a population-based case-control study, we measured promoter
methylation of 13 breast cancer-related genes in breast tumor tissue (n=765-851
cases) and global methylation in peripheral blood (1055 cases/1101 controls). PAH
sources (current active smoking, residential environmental tobacco smoke (ETS),
vehicular traffic, synthetic log burning, and grilled/smoked meat intake) were
evaluated separately. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: When comparing methylated versus unmethylated genes, synthetic log use
was associated with increased ORs for CDH1 (OR=2.26, 95%CI=1.06-4.79), HIN1
(OR=2.14, 95%CI=1.34-3.42) and RARß (OR=1.80, 95%CI=1.16-2.78) and decreased ORs 
for BRCA1 (OR=0.44, 95%CI=0.30-0.66). Residential ETS was associated with
decreased ORs for ESR1 (OR=0.74, 95%CI=0.56-0.99) and CCND2 methylation (OR=0.65,
95%CI=0.44-0.96). Current smoking and vehicular traffic were associated with
decreased ORs for DAPK (OR=0.53, 95%CI=0.28-0.99) and increased ORs for TWIST1
methylation (OR=2.79, 95%CI=1.24-6.30), respectively. In controls, synthetic log 
use was inversely associated with LINE-1 (OR=0.59, 95%CI=0.41-0.86).
DISCUSSION: PAH sources were associated with hypo- and hypermethylation at
multiple promoter regions in breast tumors and LINE-1 hypomethylation in blood of
controls. Methylation may be a potential biologic mechanism for the associations 
between PAHs and breast cancer incidence.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) serves as a key mechanism driving tumor
cell migration, invasion, and metastasis in many carcinomas. Transforming growth 
factor-beta (TGFß) signaling is implicated in several steps during cancer
pathogenesis and acts as a classical inducer of EMT. Since epithelial ovarian
cancer (EOC) cells have the potential to switch between epithelial and
mesenchymal states during metastasis, we predicted that modulation of TGFß
signaling would significantly impact EMT and the malignant potential of EOC
spheroid cells. Ovarian cancer patient ascites-derived cells naturally underwent 
an EMT response when aggregating into spheroids, and this was reversed upon
spheroid re-attachment to a substratum. CDH1/E-cadherin expression was markedly
reduced in spheroids compared with adherent cells, in concert with an
up-regulation of several transcriptional repressors, i.e., SNAI1/Snail, TWIST1/2,
and ZEB2. Treatment of EOC spheroids with the TGFß type I receptor inhibitor,
SB-431542, potently blocked the endogenous activation of EMT in spheroids.
Furthermore, treatment of spheroids with SB-431542 upon re-attachment enhanced
the epithelial phenotype of dispersing cells and significantly decreased cell
motility and Transwell migration. Spheroid formation was significantly
compromised by exposure to SB-431542 that correlated with a reduction in cell
viability particularly in combination with carboplatin treatment. Thus, our
findings are the first to demonstrate that intact TGFß signaling is required to
control EMT in EOC ascites-derived cell spheroids, and it promotes the malignant 
characteristics of these structures. As such, we show the therapeutic potential
for targeted inhibition of this pathway in ovarian cancer patients with
late-stage disease.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A variant located at the end of HDAC9 gene within
clusters of DNAse I sensitivity zones and histone modification hotspots has been 
associated with large vessel stroke and could be linked to plaque instability.
The aim of the study is to define if an altered expression of HDAC9, TWIST1 and
FERD3L genes could be involved in plaque vulnerability.
METHODS: Histological classification and gene expression analysis were performed 
in 6 stable and 16 unstable plaques obtained from asymptomatic patients
undergoing endarterectomy. Gene expression was analysed by real-time PCR.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: TWIST1 gene expression resulted higher in stable plaques
(P < 0.02). HDAC9 gene expression followed a similar trend (P = 0.11). These
results highlighting the significant correlation between TWIST and HDAC9 gene
expression suggest that both genes may contribute to plaque stability in a
coordinated way.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of RbAp48 knockdown on the migration and
invasion of human cervical cancer cells and explore the mechanism.
METHODS: A small interference RNA (siRNA) was used to knock down the expression
of RbAp48 in MS751 cells. The changes in cell migration and invasion were
evaluated using wound healing assay and Transwell assay, respectively, and the
expressions of RbAp48, vimentin, N-cadherin, E-cadherin, Snail, Twist, MMP-2 and 
TIMP-2 were determined with Western blotting.
RESULTS: After siRNA-mediated RbAp48 knockdown, MS751 cells showed a
significantly reduced expression of RbAp48 with significantly suppressed cell
migration and invasion (P<0.01). RbAp48 knockdown induced obvious down-regulation
of the expressions of interstitial cell phenotype proteins vimentin, N-cadherin, 
and MMP-2 and up-regulation of epithelial cell phenotype proteins E-cadherin and 
TIMP-2, suggesting the inhibition of epithelial- mesenchymal transition of the
cells. The expressions of Snail and Twist were significantly down-regulated in
the cells following RbAp48 knockdown.
CONCLUSION: Knockdown of RbAp48 can significantly inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition and suppress the migration and invasion of cervical cancer cell line
MS751, the mechanism of which may involve the down-regulation of Snail and Twist 
expressions.

TWIST1 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor which plays
essential and pivotal roles in multiple stages of embryonic development, and
significantly contributes to tumor metastasis, even tumor initiation and primary 
tumor growth. It is well recognized that TWIST1 is overexpressed in a variety of 
tumors. Overexpression of TWIST1 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),
a key process in the metastases formation of cancer. TWIST1 also promotes the
formation of cancer stem cells and facilitates the process of tumorigenesis.
Numerous studies have shown that targeting TWIST1 or TWIST1-related molecules
significantly inhibits tumor growth, restricts tumor metastasis, reverses drug
resistance, and thus improves the survival of cancer patients. Therefore, it is
important to provide a better understanding of the context-dependent regulation
of TWIST1 in each individual epithelial tumor, which might reveal new therapeutic
targets in cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Obesity and alcohol consumption contribute to steatohepatitis,
which increases the risk for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated hepatocellular
carcinomas (HCCs). Mouse hepatocytes that express HCV-NS5A in liver up-regulate
the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and develop liver tumors
containing tumor-initiating stem-like cells (TICs) that express NANOG. We
investigated whether the TLR4 signals to NANOG to promote the development of TICs
and tumorigenesis in mice placed on a Western diet high in cholesterol and
saturated fat (HCFD).
METHODS: We expressed HCV-NS5A from a transgene (NS5A Tg) in Tlr4-/-
(C57Bl6/10ScN), and wild-type control mice. Mice were fed a HCFD for 12 months.
TICs were identified and isolated based on being CD133+, CD49f+, and CD45-. We
obtained 142 paraffin-embedded sections of different stage HCCs and adjacent
nontumor areas from the same patients, and performed gene expression,
immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemical analyses.
RESULTS: A higher proportion of NS5A Tg mice developed liver tumors (39%) than
mice that did not express HCV NS5A after the HCFD (6%); only 9% of Tlr4-/- NS5A
Tg mice fed HCFD developed liver tumors. Livers from NS5A Tg mice fed the HCFD
had increased levels of TLR4, NANOG, phosphorylated signal transducer and
activator of transcription (pSTAT3), and TWIST1 proteins, and increases in Tlr4, 
Nanog, Stat3, and Twist1 messenger RNAs. In TICs from NS5A Tg mice, NANOG and
pSTAT3 directly interact to activate expression of Twist1. Levels of TLR4, NANOG,
pSTAT3, and TWIST were increased in HCC compared with nontumor tissues from
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: HCFD and HCV-NS5A together stimulated TLR4-NANOG and the leptin
receptor (OB-R)-pSTAT3 signaling pathways, resulting in liver tumorigenesis
through an exaggerated mesenchymal phenotype with prominent Twist1-expressing
TICs.

Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a cellular catabolic process that is
essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis and regulating various normal and
pathologic processes in human diseases including cancer. One cancer-driving
process is accumulation of genetic mutations due to impaired DNA damage repair,
including nucleotide excision repair. Here we show that autophagy positively
regulates nucleotide excision repair through enhancing DNA damage recognition by 
the DNA damage sensor proteins XPC and DDB2 via 2 pathways. First, autophagy
deficiency downregulates the transcription of XPC through TWIST1-dependent
activation of the transcription repressor complex E2F4-RBL2. Second, autophagy
deficiency impairs the recruitment of DDB2 to ultraviolet radiation (UV)-induced 
DNA damage sites through TWIST1-mediated inhibition of EP300. In mice, the
pharmacological autophagy inhibitor Spautin-1 promotes UVB-induced tumorigenesis,
whereas the autophagy inducer rapamycin reduces UVB-induced tumorigenesis. These 
findings demonstrate the crucial role of autophagy in maintaining proper
nucleotide excision repair in mammalian cells and suggest a previously
unrecognized tumor-suppressive mechanism of autophagy in cancer.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in the
development of tumor metastases by facilitating cell migration and invasion. One 
of the hallmarks of EMT is the diminished expression of E-cadherin and gain of
mesenchymal traits, which are regulated by core EMT-inducing transcriptional
factors (EMT-TFs), such as Snail/Slug, ZEB1/ZEB2, and Twist1. EMT-TFs are known
to be extremely labile proteins, and their protein levels are tightly controlled 
by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Several E3 ubiquitin ligases have been 
shown to play crucial roles in the regulation of EMT, and genetic aberrations and
alterations in these ligases have been detected in human cancer. In this review, 
we focused on EMT-TFs, describing the UPS controlling their activities and
functions in cancer. A deeper understanding of the role of UPS in the regulation 
of EMT will provide valuable information for the development of effective
anti-metastatic drugs to modulate the malignant processes mediated by EMT.

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is closely associated with
tumorigenesis. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of MIF on the
proliferation, migration and colony formation of oral squamous cell carcinoma
(OSCC), and to quantify the protein expression levels of MIF in OSCC tissue
samples. Firstly, small interfering (si)RNA was used to knock down the gene
expression of MIF in Tca8113, HN5 and SCC25 OSCC cells. Secondly, proliferation, 
migration and colony formation of the OSCC cells were determined by MTT,
transmigration and colony formation assays, respectively. Western blotting was
performed to detect changes in the protein expression levels of the epithelial
mesenchymal transition markers, Twist-related protein 1 (Twist1), matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. Finally, immunohistochemistry was used to
examine the protein expression of MIF in OSCC tissue samples. The results
demonstrated that siRNA against MIF significantly downregulated the expression
levels of MIF in all OSCC cells, and decreased their proliferation and migration 
ability. Colony formation ability was also inhibited in the OSCC cells following 
transfection with MIF siRNA. Furthermore, western blotting demonstrated that the 
protein expression of Twist1 was decreased similarly to those of MIF. The protein
expression of MMP-2 revealed no change, whereas that of MMP-9 decreased. The
protein expression of MIF was detected in OSCC tissue samples with staining
predominantly located in the cell membrane and cytoplasm. The present study
demonstrated that MIF may be important in the pathogenesis and progression of
OSCC, and indicated its potential therapeutic value.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the expression of Twist1 in cervical cancer and to explore 
its biological function in the progression of cervical cancer.<U+2029>
METHODS: The expressions of Twist1 in 32 cervical cancers and matched normal
tissues were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Cell invasive ability and
the expression of invasion-related genes were determined in RNAi-based
Twist1-silencing HeLa cells. The relationship between Twist1 and microRNA-33a
(miR-33a) in cervical cancer was studied by Pearson correlation analysis, and the
roles of miR-33a in regulation of Twist1 and cell invasiveness were studied.<U+2029>
RESULTS: The positive expression rate of Twist1 was 75.0% (24/32) and 21.9%
(7/32) in the cervical cancer and the matched normal tissues, respectively, with 
significant difference between them (P<0.05). Twist1 shRNA significantly
decreased the invasiveness of HeLa cells (P<0.05). Compared with the matched
normal tissues, the expression of miR-33a was increased in the cervical cancer
tissues, which was negatively correlated with Twist1 (r=-0.661, P<0.05).
Overexpression of miR-33a could significantly suppress Twist1 expression as well 
as cell invasiveness (P<0.05).<U+2029>
CONCLUSION: Twist1 is critical for the invasiveness of cervical cancer cells;
miR-33a, as a tumor suppressor gene, functions as an upstream regulator of Twist1
and is involved in the invasiveness of cervical cancer cell.

BACKGROUND: Aberrant expression of A20 has been reported in several human
malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its clinical
relevance and potential role in HCC remain unknown.
METHODS: Quantitative PCR, Western blots and immunohistochemistry analyses were
used to quantify A20 expression in HCC samples and cell lines. The correlation of
A20 expression with clinicopathologic features was analyzed in a cohort
containing 143 patients with primary HCC. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to
evaluate the association between A20 expression and patient survival. Functional 
studies were performed to determine the effects of A20 on proliferation and
metastasis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: Expression of A20 was increased in HCC tissues and cell lines. Increased
expression of A20 was negatively correlated with the tumor size, TNM stage, tumor
thrombus formation, capsular invasion and serum AFP levels. Patients with higher 
A20 expression had a prolonged disease-free survival and overall survival than
those with lower A20 expression. Forced expression of A20 significantly inhibited
the proliferative and invasive properties of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo,
whereas knockdown of A20 expression showed the opposite effects. Further studies 
revealed that expression of A20 was inversely correlated with Twist1 levels and
NF-<U+03BA>B activity in HCC tissues and cell lines. A20-induced suppression of
proliferation and migration of HCC cells were mainly mediated through inhibition 
of Twist1 expression that was regulated at least partly by A20-induced
attenuation of NF-<U+03BA>B activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that A20 plays a negative role in the
development and progression of HCC probably through inhibiting Twist1 expression.
A20 may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target
for HCC patients.

The heart valve interstitial cell (VIC) population is dynamic and thought to
mediate lay down and maintenance of the tri-laminar extracellular matrix (ECM)
structure within the developing and mature valve throughout life. Disturbances in
the contribution and distribution of valve ECM components are detrimental to
biomechanical function and associated with disease. This pathological process is 
associated with activation of resident VICs that in the absence of disease reside
as quiescent cells. While these paradigms have been long standing,
characterization of this abundant and ever-changing valve cell population is
incomplete. Here we examine the expression pattern of Smooth muscle a-actin,
Periostin, Twist1 and Vimentin in cultured VICs, heart valves from healthy
embryonic, postnatal and adult mice, as well as mature valves from human patients
and established mouse models of disease. We show that the VIC population is
highly heterogeneous and phenotypes are dependent on age, species, location, and 
disease state. Furthermore, we identify phenotypic diversity across common models
of mitral valve disease. These studies significantly contribute to characterizing
the VIC population in health and disease and provide insights into the cellular
dynamics that maintain valve structure in healthy adults and mediate pathologic
remodeling in disease states.

Heart valve formation initiates when endothelial cells of the heart transform
into mesenchyme and populate the cardiac cushions. The transcription factor SOX9 
is highly expressed in the cardiac cushion mesenchyme, and is essential for heart
valve development. Loss of Sox9 in mouse cardiac cushion mesenchyme alters cell
proliferation, embryonic survival, and valve formation. Despite this important
role, little is known about how SOX9 regulates heart valve formation or its
transcriptional targets. Therefore, we mapped putative SOX9 binding sites by
ChIP-Seq in E12.5 heart valves, a stage at which the valve mesenchyme is actively
proliferating and initiating differentiation. Embryonic heart valves have been
shown to express a high number of genes that are associated with chondrogenesis, 
including several extracellular matrix proteins and transcription factors that
regulate chondrogenesis. Therefore, we compared regions of putative SOX9 DNA
binding between E12.5 heart valves and E12.5 limb buds. We identified
context-dependent and context-independent SOX9-interacting regions throughout the
genome. Analysis of context-independent SOX9 binding suggests an extensive role
for SOX9 across tissues in regulating proliferation-associated genes including
key components of the AP-1 complex. Integrative analysis of tissue-specific
SOX9-interacting regions and gene expression profiles on Sox9-deficient heart
valves demonstrated that SOX9 controls the expression of several transcription
factors with previously identified roles in heart valve development, including
Twist1, Sox4, Mecom and Pitx2. Together, our data identify SOX9-coordinated
transcriptional hierarchies that control cell proliferation and differentiation
during valve formation.

BACKGROUND: Cancer metastasis is a multi-step event including
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1
(BRMS1) is a novel metastasis suppressor protein without anti-proliferating
activity. However, a detailed underlying mechanism by which BRMS1 attenuates
cancer cell EMT and invasion remained to be answered. In the present study, we
report an additional mechanism by which BRMS1 attenuates Transforming growth
factor-beta1 (TGF-ß1)-induced breast cancer cell EMT and invasion.
METHODS: Experimental analysis involving chromosome immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
and luciferase reporter assays were used to validate hypoxia inducible
factor-1alpha (HIF-1a) as a transcriptional regulator of TWIST1 and Snail.
Quantitative RT-PCR was used to analyze transcript expression. Immunoblotting and
immunofluorescence were used to analyze protein expression. Matrigel-coated in
vitro invasion insert was used to analyze cancer cell invasion.
RESULTS: BRMS1 strongly inhibited TGF-ß1-induced breast cancer cell EMT and
invasion. Unexpectedly, we observed that BRMS1 downregulates not only TWIST1 but 
also Snail expression, thereby inhibiting breast cancer cell invasion. In
addition, we provide evidence that HIF-1a is required for Snail and TWIST1
expression. Further, BRMS1 reduced TGF-ß1-induced HIF-1a transcript expression
through inactivation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-<U+03BA>B).
CONCLUSION: Collectively, the present study demonstrates a mechanical cascade of 
BRMS1 suppressing cancer cell invasion through downregulating HIF-1a transcript
and consequently reducing Snail and TWIST1 expression.

Melanoma is the most aggressive and deadly form of cutaneous neoplasm due to its 
propensity to metastasize. Oncogenic BRAF drives sustained activation of the
BRAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) pathway and cooperates with PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PI3K) signaling to
induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), leading to cell invasion and
metastasis. Therefore, targeting these pathways is a promising
preventive/therapeutic strategy. We have shown that fisetin, a flavonoid, reduces
human melanoma cell invasion by inhibiting EMT. In addition, fisetin inhibited
melanoma cell proliferation and tumor growth by downregulating the PI3K pathway. 
In this investigation, we aimed to determine whether fisetin can potentiate the
anti-invasive and anti-metastatic effects of sorafenib in BRAF-mutated melanoma. 
We found that combination treatment (fisetin + sorafenib) more effectively
reduced the migration and invasion of BRAF-mutated melanoma cells both in vitro
and in raft cultures compared to individual agents. Combination treatment also
effectively inhibited EMT as observed by a decrease in N-cadherin, vimentin and
fibronectin and an increase in E-cadherin both in vitro and in xenograft tumors. 
Furthermore, combination therapy effectively inhibited Snail1, Twist1, Slug and
ZEB1 protein expression compared to monotherapy. The expression of MMP-2 and
MMP-9 in xenograft tumors was further reduced in combination treatment compared
to individual agents. Bioluminescent imaging of athymic mice, intravenously
injected with stably transfected CMV-luciferase-ires-puromycin.T2A.EGFP-tagged
A375 melanoma cells, demonstrated fewer lung metastases following combination
treatment versus monotherapy. Our findings demonstrate that fisetin potentiates
the anti-invasive and anti-metastatic effects of sorafenib. Our data suggest that
fisetin may be a worthy adjuvant chemotherapy for the management of melanoma.

A series of pentacyclic tritperpenes found in Perilla frutescens (P. frutescens),
including ursolic acid (UA), oleanolic acid (OA), corosolic acid (CA),
3-epi-corosolic acid (3-epiCA), maslinic acid (MA), and 3-epi-maslinic acid
(3-epiMA) were evaluated for their effects on epidermal cell signaling,
proliferation, and skin inflammation in relation to their ability to inhibit skin
tumor promotion by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and compared to UA 
as the prototype compound. All compounds were given topically 30 min prior to
each TPA application and significantly inhibited skin tumor promotion. 3-epiCA
and MA were significantly more effective than UA at inhibiting tumor development.
All of these compounds significantly inhibited epidermal proliferation induced by
TPA, however, CA, 3-epiCA and MA were more effective than UA. All compounds also 
reduced skin inflammation (assessed by infiltration of mast cells and T-cells)
and inflammatory gene expression induced by TPA, however, 3-epiCA and MA were
again more effective than UA. The greater ability of 3-epiCA and MA to inhibit
skin tumor promotion was associated with greater reduction of Cox-2 and Twist1
proteins and inhibition of activation (i.e., phosphorylation) of IGF-1R, STAT3
and Src. Further study of these compounds, especially 3-epiCA and MA, for
chemopreventive activity in other cancer model systems is warranted.

The gelatinase inhibitor doxycycline is the prototypical antitumor antibiotic. We
investigated the effects of doxycycline on the migration, invasion, and
metastasis of human lung cancer cell lines and in a mouse model. We also measured
the effect of doxycycline on the transcription of epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) markers, and used immunohistochemistry to determine whether EMT 
reversal was associated with doxycycline inhibition. Doxycycline dose-dependently
inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of NCI-H446 human small cell
lung cancer cells. It also suppressed tumor growth from NCI-H446 and A549 lung
cancer cell xenografts without altering body weight, inhibited Lewis lung
carcinoma cell migration, and prolonged survival. The activities of the
transcription factors Twist1/2, SNAI1/2, AP1, NF-<U+03BA>B, and Stat3 were suppressed by
doxycycline, which reversed EMT and inhibited signal transduction, thereby
suppressing tumor growth and metastasis. Our data demonstrate functional
targeting of transcription factors by doxycycline to reverse EMT and suppress
tumor proliferation and metastasis. Thus, doxycycline selectively targets
malignant tumors and reduces its metastatic potential with less cytotoxicity in
lung cancer patients.

In salivary gland pleomorphic adenoma, expression of extracellular matrix (ECM)
substances indicates that tumor epithelial cells are becoming chondrogenic and
will produce cartilage-like mesenchymal tissues. Sox9, the master transcription
factor of chondrogenesis, is expressed in mouse salivary gland cells. To clarify 
the mechanism behind chondrogenesis in tumor epithelial cells, we examined the
expression of transcription factors related to chondrogenesis in tumors and
salivary glands. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),
quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and immunostaining were performed on pleomorphic
adenoma tissues, salivary gland tissues, and human submandibular gland (HSG)
cells. The mRNAs of essential transcription factors for chondrogenesis-Sox9,
Sox6, and Sox5-were detected in both tumor and salivary gland tissues. The mRNAs 
of aggrecan and type II collagen-cartilage-specific ECM substances-were detected 
only in tumors. Sox9 and Sox6 proteins were colocalized in many epithelial cells 
in tumors and salivary glands. Tumor epithelial cells also possessed aggrecan
protein and occasionally type II collagen protein. Moreover, mRNAs for
transcription repressors of chondrogenesis dEF1 and AP-2a were detected in both
tumors and salivary glands, whereas Twist1 mRNA was detected only in salivary
glands and was at significantly low-to-undetectable levels in tumors. Twist1
protein was localized in the Sox9-expressing salivary gland cells. HSG cells
expressed Sox9, Sox6, and Twist1, but not aggrecan or type II collagen, and thus 
were similar to salivary gland cells. Twist1 depletion by Twist1 siRNA led to the
upregulation of aggrecan and type II collagen mRNA expression in HSG cells. In
contrast, forced expression of Twist1, using Twist1 cDNA, resulted in the
downregulation of both these genes. Taken together, these results indicate that
salivary gland cells have a potential for chondrogenesis, and Twist1 depletion
concomitant with neoplastic transformation, which would permit tumor epithelial
cells to produce cartilage-like mesenchymal tissues in salivary gland pleomorphic
adenoma.

Although circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration in peripheral blood has already
been validated as a reliable biomarker in predicting prognosis in metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), patients with favorable CTC counts 
(CTC < 5/7.5 ml) still experience various survival times. Assays that can reduce 
patients' risks are urgently needed. In this study, we set up a real-time
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method to detect
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stem cell gene expression status in
peripheral blood to validate whether they could complement CTC enumeration. From 
January 2013 to June 2014 we collected peripheral blood from 70 mCRPC patients
and enumerated CTC in these blood samples using CellSearch system. At the same
time, stem cell-related genes (ABCG2, PROM1 and PSCA) and EMT-related genes
(TWIST1 and vimentin) were detected in these peripheral blood samples using an
RT-qPCR assay. Patient overall survival (OS) and treatment methods were recorded 
in the follow-up. For patients who received first-line chemotherapy, docetaxel
plus prednisone, PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS) and PSA response rate
were recorded. At the time of analysis, 35 patients had died of prostate cancer
with a median follow-up of 16.0 months. Unfavorable CTC enumerations (CTC =5/7.5 
ml) were predictive of shorter OS (p = 0.01). Also, positive stem cell gene
expression indicated poor prognosis in mCRPC patients (p = 0.01). However, EMT
gene expression status failed to show any prognostic value in OS (p = 0.78). A
multivariate analysis indicated that serum albumin (p = 0.04), ECOG performance
status (p < 0.01), CTC enumeration (p = 0.02) and stem cell gene expression
status (p = 0.01) were independent prognostic factors for OS. For the 40 patients
categorized into the favorable CTC enumeration group, positive stem cell gene
expression also suggested poor prognosis (p < 0.01). A combined prognostic model 
consisting of stem cell gene expression and CTC enumeration increased the
concordance probability estimated value from 0.716 to 0.889 in comparison with
CTC enumeration alone. For patients who received docetaxel plus prednisone as
first-line chemotherapy, positive stem cell gene expression suggested a poor
PSA-PFS (p = 0.01) and a low PSA response rate (p = 0.008). However, CTC
enumeration and EMT gene expression status did not affect PSA-PFS or PSA response
rates. As a result, detection of peripheral blood stem cell gene expression could
complement CTC enumeration in predicting OS and docetaxel-based treatment effects
in mCRPC patients.

Twist1 is a basic helix-loop-helix-containing transcription factor that is
expressed in the dental mesenchyme during the early stages of tooth development. 
To better delineate its roles in tooth development, we generated Twist1
conditional knockout embryos (Twist2(Cre) (/+);Twist1(fl/fl)) by breeding Twist1 
floxed mice (Twist1(fl/fl)) with Twist2-Cre recombinase knockin mice (Twist2(Cre)
(/+)). The Twist2(Cre) (/+);Twist1(fl/fl) embryos formed smaller tooth germs and 
abnormal cusps during early tooth morphogenesis. Molecular and histological
analyses showed that the developing molars of the Twist2(Cre) (/+);Twist1(fl/fl) 
embryos had reduced cell proliferation and expression of fibroblast growth
factors 3, 4, 9, and 10 and FGF receptors 1 and 2 in the dental epithelium and
mesenchyme. In addition, 3-week-old renal capsular transplants of embryonic day
18.5 Twist2(Cre) (/+);Twist1(fl/fl) molars showed malformed crowns and cusps with
defective crown dentin and enamel. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the
implanted mutant molars had defects in odontoblast differentiation and delayed
ameloblast differentiation. Furthermore, in vitro ChIP assays demonstrated that
Twist1 was able to bind to a specific region of the Fgf10 promoter. In
conclusion, our findings suggest that Twist1 plays crucial roles in regulating
tooth development and that it may exert its functions through the FGF signaling
pathway.

The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a pivotal role in breast
cancer progression. We found that overexpression of miR-129-5p reversed EMT,
whereas depletion of miR-129-5p induced EMT in breast cancer cells. We
demonstrated that Twist1 is a direct target of miR-129-5p. Both Twist1 and Snail 
transcriptionally suppressed miR-129-5p expression. Levels of miR-129-5p were low
in breast cancer tissues. miR-129-5p down-regulation correlated with advanced
clinical stage and poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. miR-129-5p
expression negatively correlated with Twist1 and Snail expression. Thus,
miR-129-5p down-regulation fosters EMT in breast cancer by increasing
Twist1-Snail and activating a negative feedback loop.

Metastatic pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGL) are malignant
neuroendocrine tumors frequently associated with germline mutations in the SDHB
gene. SDHB-mutated PPGL display a hypermethylator phenotype associated with
hallmarks of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In the present study, we
report the characterization of a unique model of Sdhb knockout in mouse
chromaffin cells. Sdhb deficient cells exhibit a metastatic phenotype as
highlighted by increased individual cell migration (characterized by faster
motility and increased persistence) as well as high invasive and adhesion
abilities. This phenotype is associated with the modulation of Twist1, Twist2,
Tcf3, Snai1, N-cadherin or Krt19 expression, reflecting an EMT-like reprogramming
of cells. Krt19 is epigenetically silenced in Sdhb-deficient cells and
re-expressed after treatment by the demethylating agent decitabine. Krt19 rescue 
by lentiviral transduction in Sdhb-deficient cells and Krt19 inhibition by RNA
interference in wild-type cells were performed. Both studies revealed the
involvement of KRT19 in the invasive phenotype by modulating collective and
individual migration and cell/extra-cellular matrix adhesion properties. These
findings underline the role of hypermethylation and EMT in the in vitro
acquisition of metastatic properties, following SDHB loss of function.

INTRODUCTION: The epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a well-known and
re-emerging model in pathology, has not been completely investigated in the field
of gestational pathology. This study aims at improving the comprehension of this 
process in molar disease, even looking for new possible immunohistochemical
markers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have analysed the immunohistochemical expression of
Twist1 and Snai2, two of the most important transcription factors involved in
epithelial to mesenchymal transition, in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples
of 23 spontaneous abortive pregnancies, 22 molar pregnancies (10 partial and 12
complete) and 7 term placentas.
RESULTS: Twist1 and Snai2 were highly expressed in stromal villi cells of molar
disease. Particularly, Twist1 was highly expressed in complete moles compared to 
both abortive pregnancies (p < 0.001) and partial moles (p < 0.05). Also Snai2
was more expressed by complete moles, differentiating them from non-molar
abortions (p < 0.05).
DISCUSSION: On the basis of the known cadherins and claudins expression in these 
pathologies, our new findings reinforce the hypothesis of the involvement of
epithelial to mesenchymal transition in early molar pregnancies and above all in 
complete moles. Furthermore, we highlighted that in molar disease not only the
trophoblast, but even the villi stromal cells, are involved. Thanks to their
specificity, furthermore, these Twist1 and Snai2 could be used as additional
immunohistochemical tool in the diagnosis of complete molar disease, with Twist1 
as the first choice.

The transcription factor BCL11B plays essential roles during development of the
immune, nervous, and cutaneous systems. Here we show that BCL11B is expressed in 
both osteogenic and sutural mesenchyme of the developing craniofacial complex.
Bcl11b(-/-) mice exhibit increased proliferation of osteoprogenitors, premature
osteoblast differentiation, and enhanced skull mineralization leading to
synostoses of facial and calvarial sutures. Ectopic expression of Fgfr2c, a gene 
implicated in craniosynostosis in mice and humans, and that of Runx2 was detected
within the affected sutures of Bcl11b(-/-) mice. These data suggest that ectopic 
expression of Fgfr2c in the sutural mesenchyme, without concomitant changes in
the expression of FGF ligands, appears to induce the RUNX2-dependent osteogenic
program and craniosynostosis in Bcl11b(-/-) mice.

BACKGROUND: Patients with breast cancer have an increased risk of developing
subsequent breast cancers. It is important to distinguish whether these tumours
are de novo or recurrences of the primary tumour in order to guide the
appropriate therapy. Our aim was to investigate the use of DNA methylation
profiling and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to determine whether
the second tumour is clonally related to the first tumour.
METHODS: Methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting was used to screen
promoter methylation in a panel of 13 genes reported as methylated in breast
cancer (RASSF1A, TWIST1, APC, WIF1, MGMT, MAL, CDH13, RARß, BRCA1, CDH1, CDKN2A, 
TP73, and GSTP1) in 29 tumour pairs (16 ipsilateral and 13 contralateral). Using 
the methylation profile of these genes, we employed a Bayesian and an empirical
statistical approach to estimate clonal relationship. Copy number alterations
were analysed using aCGH on the same set of tumour pairs.
RESULTS: There is a higher probability of the second tumour being recurrent in
ipsilateral tumours compared with contralateral tumours (38 % versus 8 %;
p<U+2009><0.05) based on the methylation profile. Using previously reported recurrence
rates as Bayesian prior probabilities, we classified 69 % of ipsilateral and 15 %
of contralateral tumours as recurrent. The inferred clonal relationship results
of the tumour pairs were generally concordant between methylation profiling and
aCGH.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that DNA methylation profiling as well as aCGH have 
potential as diagnostic tools in improving the clinical decisions to
differentiate recurrences from a second de novo tumour.

PURPOSE: To investigate if cetuximab induces epithelial to mesenchymal transition
(EMT) and activation of cancer associated fibroblast (CAF) in the tumors of
patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).
METHODS: Cetuximab was administered for two weeks prior to surgery to 20
treatment-naïve patients. Five untreated patients were included as controls.
Tumor biopsies were performed at baseline and before surgery. Gene expression
profiles and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of the pre-and
post-treatment biopsies were compared. To further investigate EMT and CAF,
correlations between previously described EMT and CAF markers and our microarray 
data set were calculated.
RESULTS: Gene expression profile analyses and qRT-PCR showed that some of the
genes modified by cetuximab were related to CAFs and EMT (ZNF521, CXCL12, ASPN,
OLFML3, OLFM1, TWIST1, LEF1, ZEB1, FAP). We identified 2 patient clusters with
different EMT and CAF characteristics. Whereas one cluster showed clear
upregulation of expression of genes implicated in CAF and EMT including markers
of embryologic pathways like NOTCH and Wnt, the other did not.
CONCLUSIONS: Even if EMT and CAFs are implicated in cetuximab resistance in
pre-clinical models, we demonstrate for the first time that these molecular
processes may occur clinically early on.

Metastasis occurs due to migration of the cells from primary tumor toward other
tissues by gaining invasive properties. Since metastatic invasion shows a strong 
resistance against conventional cancer treatments, the studies on this issue have
been focused. Within this context, inhibition of migration and determination of
the relationships at the gene level will contribute to treatment of metastatic
cancer cases. We have aimed to demonstrate the impact of TGF-ß1 and fluvastatin
on human breast cancer (MCF-7) and human hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep3B) cell
cultures via Real-Time Cell Analyzer (RTCA) and to test the expression levels of 
some genes (NDRG1, SGK1, TWIST1, AMPKA2) and to compare their gene expression
levels according to RTCA results. Both of cell series were applied TGF-ß1 and
combinations of TGF-ß1/fluvastatin. Primer and probes were synthesized using
Universal Probe Library (UPL, Roche) software, and expression levels of genes
were tested via qPCR using the device LightCycler 480 II (Roche). Consequently,
fluvastatin dose-dependently inhibited migration induced by TGF-ß1 in both
groups. This inhibition was accompanied by low level of SGK1 messenger RNA (mRNA)
and high levels of NDRG1 and AMPKA2 mRNA. Thus, we conclude that fluvastatin
plays an important role in reducing resistance to chemotherapeutics and
preventing metastasis.

There is a high frequency of tumor recurrence in non-muscle invasive bladder
cancer (NMIBC) after transurethral resection and postoperative intravesical
chemotherapy, however, the molecular mechanisms leading to the chemoresistance
and tumor re-growth remain largely unknown. In this study, we observed a
significant decrease of DAB2IP expression in high-grade and recurrent NMIBC
specimens, which was negatively correlated with Twist1 expression and predicted a
lower recurrence-free survival of patients. Mechanistically, DAB2IP could inhibit
the phosphorylation and transactivation of STAT3, and then subsequently suppress 
the expression of Twist1 and its target gene P-glycoprotein, both of which were
crucial for the pirarubicin chemoresistance and tumor re-growth of bladder cancer
cells. Overall, this study reveals a new promising biomarker modulating the
chemoresistance and tumor recurrence of NMIBC after bladder preservation surgery.

BHLHE40 and BHLHE41 (BHLHE40/41) are basic helix-loop-helix type transcription
factors that play key roles in multiple cell behaviors. BHLHE40/41 were recently 
shown to be involved in an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However,
the precise mechanism of EMT control by BHLHE40/41 remains unclear. In the
present study, we demonstrated that BHLHE40/41 expression was controlled in a
pathological stage-dependent manner in human endometrial cancer (HEC). Our in
vitro assays showed that BHLHE40/41 suppressed tumor cell invasion. BHLHE40/41
also suppressed the transcription of the EMT effectors SNAI1, SNAI2, and TWIST1. 
We identified the critical promoter regions of TWIST1 for its basal
transcriptional activity. We elucidated that the transcription factor SP1 was
involved in the basal transcriptional activity of TWIST1 and that BHLHE40/41
competed with SP1 for DNA binding to regulate gene transcription. This study is
the first to report the detailed functions of BHLHE40 and BHLHE41 in the
suppression of EMT effectors in vitro. Our results suggest that BHLHE40/41
suppress tumor cell invasion by inhibiting EMT in tumor cells. We propose that
BHLHE40/41 are promising markers to predict the aggressiveness of each HEC case
and that molecular targeting strategies involving BHLHE40/41 and SP1 may
effectively regulate HEC progression.

EPHA4 belongs to the largest subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases. In addition 
to its function during development, overexpression of EPHA4 in tumors has been
correlated with increased proliferation, migration and poor survival. Several
genome-wide transcription profiling studies have demonstrated high EPHA4
expression in Sézary syndrome (SS), a leukemic variant of cutaneous CD4+ T-cell
lymphoma (CTCL) with an aggressive clinical course and poor prognosis. In this
study we set out to explore the functional role of EPHA4 in SS. Both high EPHA4
mRNA and protein expression was found in circulating SS-cells of patients
compared to healthy CD4+ T-cells. However, using a phosphospecific EPHA4
antibody, phosphorylation of the EPHA4 kinase domain was not detected in either
circulating or skin residing SS cells. Moreover, treatment with the phosphatase
inhibitor pervanadate did not result in detectable phosphorylation of the EPHA4
kinase domain, in either SS cells or in healthy CD4+ T-cells. Thus, the results
from our study confirm high EPHA4 expression in SS cells both on the mRNA and
protein levels, making EPHA4 a good diagnostic marker. However, the overexpressed
EPHA4 does not appear to be functionally active and its overexpression might be
secondary to other oncogenic drivers in SS, like STAT3 and TWIST1.

Increasingly, the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy agents for breast cancer
has been related to changes in the genomic profile of tumors. We investigated
correspondence between growth inhibitory concentrations of paclitaxel and
gemcitabine (GI50) and gene copy number, mutation, and expression first in breast
cancer cell lines and then in patients. Genes encoding direct targets of these
drugs, metabolizing enzymes, transporters, and those previously associated with
chemoresistance to paclitaxel (n = 31 genes) or gemcitabine (n = 18) were
analyzed. A multi-factorial, principal component analysis (MFA) indicated
expression was the strongest indicator of sensitivity for paclitaxel, and copy
number and expression were informative for gemcitabine. The factors were combined
using support vector machines (SVM). Expression of 15 genes (ABCC10, BCL2,
BCL2L1, BIRC5, BMF, FGF2, FN1, MAP4, MAPT, NFKB2, SLCO1B3, TLR6, TMEM243, TWIST1,
and CSAG2) predicted cell line sensitivity to paclitaxel with 82% accuracy. Copy 
number profiles of 3 genes (ABCC10, NT5C, TYMS) together with expression of 7
genes (ABCB1, ABCC10, CMPK1, DCTD, NME1, RRM1, RRM2B), predicted gemcitabine
response with 85% accuracy. Expression and copy number studies of two independent
sets of patients with known responses were then analyzed with these models. These
included tumor blocks from 21 patients that were treated with both paclitaxel and
gemcitabine, and 319 patients on paclitaxel and anthracycline therapy. A new
paclitaxel SVM was derived from an 11-gene subset since data for 4 of the
original genes was unavailable. The accuracy of this SVM was similar in cell
lines and tumor blocks (70-71%). The gemcitabine SVM exhibited 62% prediction
accuracy for the tumor blocks due to the presence of samples with poor nucleic
acid integrity. Nevertheless, the paclitaxel SVM predicted sensitivity in 84% of 
patients with no or minimal residual disease.

Active Stat5a/b predicts early recurrence and disease-specific death in prostate 
cancer (PC), which both typically are caused by development of metastatic
disease. Herein, we demonstrate that Stat5a/b induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) of PC cells, as shown by Stat5a/b regulation of EMT marker
expression (Twist1, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin) in PC cell
lines, xenograft tumors in vivo, and patient-derived PCs ex vivo using organ
explant cultures. Jak2-Stat5a/b signaling induced functional end points of EMT as
well, indicated by disruption of epithelial cell monolayers and increased
migration and adhesion of PC cells to fibronectin. Knockdown of Twist1 suppressed
Jak2-Stat5a/b-induced EMT properties of PC cells, which were rescued by
re-introduction of Twist1, indicating that Twist1 mediates Stat5a/b-induced EMT
in PC cells. While promoting EMT, Jak2-Stat5a/b signaling induced stem-like
properties in PC cells, such as sphere formation and expression of cancer stem
cell markers, including BMI1. Mechanistically, both Twist1 and BMI1 were critical
for Stat5a/b induction of stem-like features, because genetic knockdown of Twist1
suppressed Stat5a/b-induced BMI1 expression and sphere formation in stem cell
culture conditions, which were rescued by re-introduction of BMI1. By using human
prolactin knock-in mice, we demonstrate that prolactin-Stat5a/b signaling
promoted metastases formation of PC cells in vivo. In conclusion, our data
support the concept that Jak2-Stat5a/b signaling promotes metastatic progression 
of PC by inducing EMT and stem cell properties in PC cells.

Twist1 Is a TNF-Inducible Inhibitor of Clock Mediated Activation of Period Genes.

BACKGROUND: Activation of the immune system affects the circadian clock. Tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) and Interleukin (IL)-1ß inhibit the expression of clock
genes including Period (Per) genes and the PAR-bZip clock-controlled gene D-site 
albumin promoter-binding protein (Dbp). These effects are due to cytokine-induced
interference of E-box mediated transcription of clock genes. In the present study
we have assessed the two E-box binding transcriptional regulators Twist1 and
Twist2 for their role in cytokine induced inhibition of clock genes.
METHODS: The expression of the clock genes Per1, Per2, Per3 and of Dbp was
assessed in NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts and the mouse hippocampal neuronal cell
line HT22. Cells were treated for 4h with TNF and IL-1ß. The functional role of
Twist1 and Twist2 was assessed by siRNAs against the Twist genes and by
overexpression of TWIST proteins. In luciferase (luc) assays NIH-3T3 cells were
transfected with reporter gene constructs, which contain a 3xPer1 E-box or a Dbp 
E-box. Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed using
antibodies to TWIST1 and CLOCK, and the E-box consensus sequences of Dbp (CATGTG)
and Per1 E-box (CACGTG).
RESULTS: We report here that siRNA against Twist1 protects NIH-3T3 cells and HT22
cells from down-regulation of Period and Dbp by TNF and IL-1ß. Overexpression of 
Twist1, but not of Twist2, mimics the effect of the cytokines. TNF down-regulates
the activation of Per1-3xE-box-luc, the effect being prevented by siRNA against
Twist1. Overexpression of Twist1, but not of Twist2, inhibits Per1-3xE-box-luc or
Dbp-E-Box-luc activity. ChIP experiments show TWIST1 induction by TNF to compete 
with CLOCK binding to the E-box of Period genes and Dbp.
CONCLUSION: Twist1 plays a pivotal role in the TNF mediated suppression of E-box 
dependent transactivation of Period genes and Dbp. Thereby Twist1 may provide a
link between the immune system and the circadian timing system.

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether lung endothelial cells (ECs) from patients with
systemic sclerosis (SSc)-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD) express
mesenchymal cell-specific proteins and gene transcripts, indicative of the
occurrence of endothelial-to-mesenchymal phenotypic transition (EndoMT).
METHODS: Lung tissue from 6 patients with SSc-associated pulmonary fibrosis was
examined by histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Confocal laser microscopy
was utilized to assess the simultaneous expression of EC and myofibroblast
molecular markers. CD31+CD102+ ECs were isolated from the lung tissue of 2
patients with SSc-associated ILD and 2 normal control subjects, and the
expression of EC and mesenchymal cell markers and other relevant genes was
analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence
microscopy, and Western blotting.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining revealed cells expressing the EC-specific
marker CD31 in the subendothelial, perivascular, and parenchymal regions of the
lungs from all SSc patients. Confocal microscopy identified cells displaying
simultaneous expression of von Willebrand factor and a-smooth muscle actin in
small and medium-sized arterioles in the SSc lung tissue but not in normal
control lungs. CD31+CD102+ ECs isolated from SSc lungs expressed high levels of
mesenchymal cell-specific genes (type I collagen, type III collagen, and
fibronectin), EC-specific genes (type IV collagen and VE-cadherin), profibrotic
genes (transforming growth factor ß1 and connective tissue growth factor), and
genes encoding EndoMT-related transcription factors (TWIST1 and SNAI2).
CONCLUSION: Cells coexpressing EC- and mesenchymal cell-specific molecules are
present in the lungs of patients with SSc-associated ILD. CD31+CD102+ ECs
isolated from SSc lungs simultaneously expressed mesenchymal cell- and
EC-specific transcripts and proteins. Collectively, these observations
demonstrate the occurrence of EndoMT in the lungs of patients with SSc-associated
ILD.

Twist1 overexpression corresponds with poor survival in non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), but the underlining mechanism is not clear. The objective of the 
present study was to investigate the tumorigenic role of Twist1 and its related
molecular mechanisms in NSCLC. Twist1 was overexpressed in 34.7% of NSCLC
patients. The survival rate was significantly lower in patients with high Twist1 
expression than low expression (P < 0.05). Twist1 expression levels were higher
in H1650 cells, but relatively lower in H1975 cells. H1650 with stable Twist1
knockdown, H1650shTw, demonstrated a significantly slower rate of wound closure; 
however, H1975 with stable Twist1 overexpression, H1975Over, had an increased
motility velocity. A significant decrease in colony number and size was observed 
in H1650shTw, but a significant increase in colony number was found in H1975Over 
(P < 0.05). Tumor growth significantly decreased in mice implanted with H1650shTw
compared to H1650 (P < 0.05). 4E-BP1 and p53 gene expressions were increased, but
p-4E-BP1 and p-mTOR protein expressions were decreased in H1650shTw. However,
4E-BP1 gene expression was decreased, while p-4E-BP1 and p-mTOR protein
expressions were increased in H1975Over. p-4E-BP1 was overexpressed in 24.0% of
NSCLC patients. Survival rate was significantly lower in patients with high
p-4E-BP1 expression than low p-4E-BP1 (P < 0.01). A significant correlation was
found between Twist1 and p-4E-BP1 (P < 0.01). A total of 13 genes in RT-PCR array
showed significant changes in H1650shTw. Altogether, Twist1 is correlated with
p-4E-BP1 in predicting the prognostic outcome of NSCLC. Inhibition of Twist1
decreases p-4E-BP1 expression possibly through downregulating p-mTOR and
increasing p53 expression in NSCLC.

vs. N-cadherin deficient cells.

Metformin has emerged as a potential anticancer agent. Here, we demonstrate that 
metformin plays an anti-tumor role via repressing N-cadherin, independent of
AMPK, in wild-type N-cadherin cancer cells. Ectopic-expression of N-cadherin
develops metformin-resistant cancer cells, while suppression of N-cadherin
sensitizes cancer to metformin. Manipulation of AMPK expression does not alter
sensitivity of cancer to metformin. We show that NF-kappaB is a downstream
molecule of N-cadherin and metformin regulates NF-kappaB signaling via
suppressing N-cadherin. Moreover, we also suggest that TWIST1 is an upstream
molecule of N-cadherin/NF-kappaB signaling and manipulation of TWIST1 expression 
changes the sensitivity of cancer cells to metformin. In contrast to the cells
that express N-cadherin, in N-cadherin deficient cells, metformin plays an
anti-tumor role via activation of AMPK. Ectopic expression of N-cadherin makes
cancer more resistant to metformin. Therefore, we suggest that metformin's
anti-cancer therapeutic effect is mediated through different molecular mechanism 
in wild-type vs. deficient N-cadherin cancer cells. At last, we selected 49 out
of 984 patients' samples with prostatic cancer after radical prostatectomy
(selection criteria: Gleason score = 7 and all patients taking metformin) and
showed levels of N-cadherin, p65 and AMPK could predict post-surgical recurrence 
in prostate cancer after treatment of metformin.

Schwann cells are the main source of paracrine support to motor neurons.
Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been correlated to motor
neuron death in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Despite the involvement of
Schwann cells in early neuromuscular disruption in ALS, detailed molecular events
of a dying-back triggering are unknown. Sciatic nerves of presymptomatic
(60-day-old) SOD1(G93A) mice were submitted to a high-density oligonucleotide
microarray analysis. DAVID demonstrated the deregulated genes related to death,
stress and mitochondrion, which allowed the identification of Cell cycle, ErbB
signaling, Tryptophan metabolism and Rig-I-like receptor signaling as the most
representative KEGG pathways. The protein-protein interaction networks based upon
deregulated genes have identified the top hubs (TRAF2, H2AFX, E2F1, FOXO3, MSH2, 
NGFR, TGFBR1) and bottlenecks (TRAF2, E2F1, CDKN1B, TWIST1, FOXO3). Schwann cells
were enriched from the sciatic nerve of presymptomatic mice using flow cytometry 
cell sorting. qPCR showed the up regulated (Ngfr, Cdnkn1b, E2f1, Traf2 and Erbb3,
H2afx, Cdkn1a, Hspa1, Prdx, Mapk10) and down-regulated (Foxo3, Mtor) genes in the
enriched Schwann cells. In conclusion, molecular analyses in the presymptomatic
sciatic nerve demonstrated the involvement of death, oxidative stress, and
mitochondrial pathways in the Schwann cell non-autonomous mechanisms in the early
stages of ALS.

Understanding the molecular mechanism by which epithelial mesenchymal transition 
(EMT)-mediated cancer metastasis and how microRNA (miRNA) regulates lung cancer
progression via Twist1-activated EMT may provide potential therapeutic targets
for cancer therapy. Here we found that miR-33a, an intronic miRNA located within 
the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2) gene, is expressed at
low levels in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and is
inversely correlated with Twist1 expression. Conversely, miR-33a knockdown
induces EMT and miR-33a overexpression blocks EMT by regulating of Twist1
expression in NSCLC cells. Bioinformatical prediction and luciferase reporter
assay confirm that Twist1 is a direct target of miR-33a. Additionally, Twist1
knockdown blocks EMT-related metastasis and forced expression of miR-33a inhibits
lung cancer metastasis in a xenograft animal model. Clinically, miR-33a is found 
to be at low levels in NSCLC patients and down-regulation of miR-33a predicts a
poor prognosis. These findings suggest that miR-33a targets Twist1 and inhibits
invasion and metastasis in NSCLC. Thus, miR-33a might be a potential prognostic
marker and of therapeutic relevance for NSCLC metastasis intervention.

PURPOSE: Many patients enter the care cycle with gross or microscopic hematuria
and undergo cystoscopy to rule out bladder cancer. Sensitivity of this invasive
examination is limited, leaving many patients at risk for undetected cancer. To
improve current clinical practice more sensitive and noninvasive screening
methods should be applied.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 154 urine samples were collected from patients 
with hematuria, including 80 without and 74 with bladder cancer. DNA from cells
in the urine was epigenetically profiled using 2 independent assays. Methylation 
specific polymerase chain reaction was performed on TWIST1. SNaPshot methylation
analysis was done for different loci of OTX1 and ONECUT2. Additionally all
samples were analyzed for mutation status of TERT (telomerase reverse
transcriptase), PIK3CA, FGFR3 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3), HRAS, KRAS
and NRAS.
RESULTS: The combination of TWIST1, ONECUT2 (2 loci) and OTX1 resulted in the
best overall performing panel. Logistic regression analysis on these methylation 
markers, mutation status of FGFR3, TERT and HRAS, and patient age resulted in an 
accurate model with 97% sensitivity, 83% specificity and an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI
0.88-0.98). Internal validation led to an optimism corrected AUC of 0.92. With an
estimated bladder cancer prevalence of 5% to 10% in a hematuria cohort the assay 
resulted in a 99.6% to 99.9% negative predictive value.
CONCLUSIONS: Epigenetic profiling using TWIST1, ONECUT2 and OTX1 results in a
high sensitivity and specificity. Accurate risk prediction might result in less
extensive and invasive examination of patients at low risk, thereby reducing
unnecessary patient burden and health care costs.

PURPOSE: Transcription factors regulating the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) program contribute to carcinogenesis and metastasis in many
tumors, including cutaneous melanoma. However, little is known about the role of 
EMT factors in the growth and metastatic dissemination of uveal melanoma cells.
Here, we analyzed the expression and functions of the EMT factors ZEB1, Twist1,
and Snail1 in uveal melanoma cell lines and primary tumors.
METHODS: ZEB1, Twist1, and Snail1 mRNA levels were measured using qPCR in five
uveal melanoma cell lines and in 30 primary tumors. Gene expression was used to
determine class 1 and class 2 signatures in the primary tumors. Short hairpin RNA
was used to downregulate the expressions of the EMT factors; then, growth and
transwell invasion assays were performed.
RESULTS: ZEB1, Twist1, and Snail1 were expressed in all five uveal melanoma
lines, with ZEB1 having the highest protein levels. ZEB1 mRNA was significantly
elevated in highly metastatic class 2 primary tumors for which survival data were
not available, whereas a high gene expression of Twist1 was associated with a
worse prognosis in a separate tumor cohort analyzed by expression profiling. The 
genetic downregulation of ZEB1 in OCM1, OMM1, and 92.1 resulted in a more than
50% reduction in invasion, but only suppressed growth in OMM1 cells. Suppression 
of Twist1 in Mel290 and OMM1 reduced growth and invasion by more than 50%. The
downregulation of Snail1 in the 92.1 cell line reduced invasion by 50%, but did
not interfere with growth.
CONCLUSIONS: The downregulation of ZEB1, Twist1, and Snail1 reduces the invasive 
properties of uveal melanoma cells, and the elevated mRNA levels of ZEB1 and
Twist1 are associated with a more aggressive clinical phenotype in uveal melanoma
samples. Therefore, these factors could represent new therapeutic targets in
patients with ocular melanoma.

Hypoxia plays a pivotal role in tumor progression. The functions of hypoxia and
subsequent Bcl-2/Twist1 activation in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
vasculogenic mimicry (VM) formation are currently unclear. This study aimed to
investigate the role of Bcl-2/Twist1 cooperation in hypoxia-induced EMT and VM
formation. In in vitro experiments, we found that hypoxia resulted in
co-overexpression of Bcl-2 and Twist1, facilitated Twist1 nuclear translocation
and promoted EMT and VM formation. Co-overexpression of Bcl-2 and Twist1 under
normoxia could also induce EMT and promote VM formation. Furthermore, blocking
Bcl-2 or Twist1 attenuated the effects of hypoxia on EMT progress and VM
formation in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In in vivo experiments, the
mechanism by which hypoxia promoted Bcl-2 and Twist1 co-overexpression and
induced EMT process and VM formation was demonstrated using murine xenograft
models. These results above suggest that hypoxia could activate the cooperation
of Bcl-2 and Twist1, Bcl-2 plays an important role in assisting Twist1 nuclear
translocation which could change the expression of a wide range of genes and lead
to the induction of EMT and VM formation.

Although invasive and metastatic progression via the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and acquisition of resistance to castration are both critical
steps in prostate cancer, the molecular mechanism of this interaction remains
unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the interaction of signaling
between castration resistance and EMT, and to apply this information to the
development of a novel therapeutic concept using transforming growth factor-ß
(TGF-ß) inhibitor SB525334 combined with androgen-deprivation therapy against
prostate cancer using an in vivo model. This study revealed that an EMT inducer
(TGF-ß) induced full-length androgen receptor (AR) and AR variant expression. In 
addition, a highly invasive clone showed augmented full-length AR and AR variant 
expression as well as acquisition of castration resistance. Conversely,
full-length AR and AR as well as Twist1 and mesenchymal molecules variant
expression were up-regulated in castration-resistant LNCaP xenograft. Finally,
TGF-ß inhibitor suppressed Twist1 and AR expression as well as prostate cancer
growth combined with castration. Taken together, these results demonstrate that
Twist1/AR signaling was augmented in castration resistant as well as
mesenchymal-phenotype prostate cancer, indicating the molecular mechanism of
mutual and functional crosstalk between EMT and castration resistance, which may 
play a crucial role in prostate carcinogenesis and progression.

Craniosynostosis, the premature closure of cranial sutures, is a common
craniofacial disorder with heterogeneous etiology and appearance. The purpose of 
this study was to investigate the clinical and molecular characteristics of
craniosynostoses in Hungary, including the classification of patients and the
genetic analysis of the syndromic forms. Between 2006 and 2012, 200 patients with
craniosynostosis were studied. Classification was based on the suture(s) involved
and the associated clinical features. In syndromic cases, genetic analyses,
including mutational screening of the hotspot regions of the FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3,
and TWIST1 genes, karyotyping and FISH study of TWIST1, were performed. The
majority (88%) of all patients with craniosynostosis were nonsyndromic. The
sagittal suture was most commonly involved, followed by the coronal, metopic, and
lambdoid sutures. Male, twin gestation, and very low birth weight were risk
factors for craniosynostosis. Syndromic craniosynostosis was detected in 24
patients. In 17 of these patients, Apert, Crouzon, Pfeiffer, Muenke, or
Saethre-Chotzen syndromes were identified. In one patient, multiple-suture
craniosynostosis was associated with achondroplasia. Clinical signs were not
typical for any particular syndrome in six patients. Genetic abnormalities were
detected in 18 syndromic patients and in 8 relatives. In addition to 10
different, known mutations in FGFR1,FGFR2 or FGFR3, one novel missense mutation, 
c.528C>G(p.Ser176Arg), was detected in the TWIST1 gene of a patient with
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Our results indicate that detailed clinical assessment 
is of paramount importance in the classification of patients and allows
indication of targeted molecular testing with the highest possible diagnostic
yield. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Expression of the oncogene Twist1 is correlated with tumor development and
metastasis. Recent studies have suggested that the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) is necessary for tumor progression and metastases. Little is
known concerning the role of Twist1 and EMT in thyroid cancer. In the present
work, the expression levels of Twist1 and one marker of EMT, vimentin, were
measured in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The results showed Twist1
expression to be correlated only with cancer lymph node metastases (P = 0.004)
and not with other clinicopathological indicators. Moreover, Twist1 expression
was positively correlated with the expression of vimentin (r = 0.408, P = 0.003).
In vitro studies further indicated that reducing Twist1 expression using short
hairpin RNA against Twist1 can decrease the invasive and metastatic properties of
PTC cells and that the down-regulation of Twist1 can reverse EMT by increasing
the expression of E-cadherin and down-regulating the expression of vimentin in
the PTC cell line IHH-4. To investigate the effects on Twist1, the PTC cell lines
TPC-1 and BCPAP were treated with TNF-a, resulting in Twist1 up-regulation that
was dependent on NF-<U+03BA>B activation. After the inhibition of NF-<U+03BA>B activity with
Bay11-7082, the Twist1 mRNA and protein levels could not be increased. The
decline in the Twist1 mRNA and protein levels rendered the cancer cells less
invasive. Thus, we conclude that Twist1 plays an important role in the EMT of PTC
via the NF-<U+03BA>B pathway.

Nuclear receptor coactivator 1 (NCOA1) is overexpressed in a subset of breast
cancer and its increased expression positively correlates with disease recurrence
and metastasis. Although NCOA1 is known to promote breast cancer metastasis
through working with multiple transcription factors to upregulate the expression 
of Twist1, ITGA5, CSF-1, SDF1 and CXCR4, the role of NCOA1 in breast tumor
angiogenesis has not been investigated. In this study, we found that the
microvascular density (MVD) was significantly decreased and increased in
Ncoa1-knockout and NCOA1-overexpressing mammary tumors, respectively, in several 
breast cancer mouse models. Knockout or knockdown of NCOA1 in breast cancer cell 
lines also markedly compromised their capability to induce angiogenesis in
Matrigel plugs embedded subcutaneously in mice, while this compromised capability
could be rescued by VEGFa treatment. At the molecular level, NCOA1 upregulates
VEGFa expression in both mouse mammary tumors and cultured breast cancer cells,
and it does so by associating with both c-Fos, which is recruited to the AP-1
site at bp -938 of the VEGFa promoter, and HIF1a, which is recruited to the
HIF1a-binding element at bp -979 of the VEGFa promoter, to enhance VEGFa
transcription. In 140 human breast tumors, high NCOA1 protein correlates with
high MVD and patients with both high NCOA1 and high MVD showed significantly
shorter survival time. In summary, this study revealed a novel mechanism that
NCOA1 potentiates breast cancer angiogenesis through upregulating HIF1a and
AP-1-mediated VEGFa expression, which reinforces the rational of targeting NCOA1 
in controlling breast cancer progression and metastasis.

Medicine, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 120-752, South Korea.

Adipocytes are known to be involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in
several cancers. However, the role of adipocytes in the EMT of breast cancer
cells is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the
involvement of adipocytes in the EMT in breast cancer. Breast cancer cell lines
MCF-7, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-435S, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 were co-cultured with 
adipocytes and analyzed for morphological changes, proliferation activity, EMT
markers, migration, and invasion. In addition, 296 human breast cancer specimens 
were classified according to the presence of the fibrous or adipose stroma and
analyzed by immunohistochemistry for the expression of estrogen and progesterone 
receptors, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, antigen Ki-67, N-cadherin,
Twist-related protein 1 (TWIST1), high-mobility group AT-hook 2, TGFß, and S100
calcium-binding protein A4 using tissue microarray. After co-culture with
adipocytes, MCF-7, MDA-MB-435S, and MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited elongated
spindle-like morphology and increased proliferation; MDA-MB-435S and MDA-MB-231
cells also showed increased dispersion. In all tested breast cancer cells,
adipocytes induced migration and invasion. The EMT-like phenotypic changes and
increased cell migration and invasion were accompanied by the upregulation of
matrix metallopeptidase 9 and TWIST1. Consistently, breast cancer tumors with the
adipose stroma showed higher TWIST1 expression than those with the adipose
stroma; however, no difference was observed in the levels of other EMT-related
proteins. Adipocytes stimulate breast cancer cells to acquire aggressive tumor
phenotype by inducing EMT-associated traits, and breast cancer with the adipose
stroma expresses EMT markers as breast cancer with the fibrous stroma.

The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a vital role in
carcinogenesis, invasion, and metastasis of many epithelial tumors including oral
squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), a common malignancy of the head and neck.
However, the functional role of the actin-sequestering protein thymosin ß4 (Tß4) 
in the EMT in OSCCs remains unclear. Thus, we investigated whether overexpression
of Tß4 could induce in vitro tumorigenesis such as cell proliferation and
anchorage independency and an EMT-like phenotype in OSCCs. Also, we examined
whether it affects invasiveness and cell motility-associated signaling molecules.
Tß4-overexpressing OSCCs, SCC-15_Tß4 and SCC-25_Tß4, enhanced cell proliferation 
and colony formation. In addition, we observed that Tß4 overexpression induced an
EMT-like phenotype, accompanied by a decrease in expression of the epithelial
cell marker E-cadherin and an increase in expression of mesenchymal cell markers 
vimentin and N-cadherin. Also, the expression level of Twist1, an EMT-inducing
transcription factor, was significantly enhanced in SCC-15_Tß4 and SCC-25_Tß4
cells. Tß4 overexpression augmented in vitro invasion and MMP-2 activity and
enhanced the phosphorylation of paxillin and cortactin and expression of LIMK1.
Taken together, these results suggest that Tß4 overexpression could be one of the
causes of tumorigenesis and progression in OSCCs. Further investigation on the
Tß4 molecule would encourage the development of specific targets for cancer
treatment.

Twist1 is a highly conserved basic helix-loophelix transcription factor, and has 
been shown to play an important role in carcinogenesis of many tumors including
colorectal cancer (CRC). Here we aimed to investigate the role of Twist1 in the
clinical significance and chemoresistance in CRC. In this study, we examined the 
correlation between Twist1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics
using immunohistochemistry in patients with CRC. The molecular mechanisms of
Twist1 expression and its effects on chemosensitivity to 5-Fluorouracil and
oxaliplatin were also explored by MTT assay, colony forming assay, flow cytometry
assay. The results indicate that Twist1 is overexpressed in cancer tissue, and
its positive expression are related to histological grade (P=0.004), T-stage
(P=0.033), N-stage (P=0.000), M-stage (P=0.040), TNM stage (P=0.002) and
recurrence (P=0.023). Moreover, positive Twist1 expression is correlated with
poor overall survival in CRC patients (P<0.0001), and is a significant
independent prognostic indicator. In addition, we show that knockdown of Twist1
inhibits proliferation, and increased the percentage of apoptotic cells of CRC
cell lines. Our findings suggest that Twist1 promotes proliferation and
chemoresistance of CRC cells. Twist1 may be a potential prognostic marker and a
molecular target for therapies.

The unique characteristic of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is
that local invasion rather than distant metastasis is the major route for
dissemination. Therefore, targeting the locally invasive cancer cells is more
important than preventing systemic metastasis in HNSCC and other
invasive-predominant cancers. We previously demonstrate a specific mechanism for 
HNSCC local invasion: the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulator
Twist1 represses microRNA let-7i expression, leading to the activation of the
small GTPase Rac1 and engendering the mesenchymal-mode movement in
three-dimensional (3D) culture. However, targeting the EMT regulator is
relatively difficult because of its transcription factor nature and the strategy 
for confining HNSCC invasion to facilitate local treatment is limited. Imipramine
blue (IB) is a newly identified anti-invasive compound that effectively inhibits 
glioma invasion. Here we demonstrate that in HNSCC cells, a noncytotoxic dose of 
IB represses mesenchymal-mode migration in two-and-a-half-dimensional/3D culture 
system. IB suppresses EMT and stemness of HNSCC cells through inhibition of
Twist1-mediated let-7i downregulation and Rac1 activation and the EMT signalling.
Mechanistically, IB inhibits reactive oxygen species-induced nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B
pathway activation. Importantly, IB promotes degradation of the EMT inducer
Twist1 by enhancing F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 14 (FBXL14)-mediated
polyubiquitination of Twist1. Together, this study demonstrates the potent
anti-invasion and EMT-inhibition effect of IB, suggesting the potential of IB in 
treating local invasion-predominant cancers.Oncogene advance online publication,

Kidney fibrosis is marked by an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of
tubular epithelial cells (TECs). Here we find that, during renal fibrosis, TECs
acquire a partial EMT program during which they remain associated with their
basement membrane and express markers of both epithelial and mesenchymal cells.
The functional consequence of the EMT program during fibrotic injury is an arrest
in the G2 phase of the cell cycle and lower expression of several solute and
solvent transporters in TECs. We also found that transgenic expression of either 
Twist1 (encoding twist family bHLH transcription factor 1, known as Twist) or
Snai1 (encoding snail family zinc finger 1, known as Snail) expression is
sufficient to promote prolonged TGF-ß1-induced G2 arrest of TECs, limiting the
cells' potential for repair and regeneration. In mouse models of experimentally
induced renal fibrosis, conditional deletion of Twist1 or Snai1 in proximal TECs 
resulted in inhibition of the EMT program and the maintenance of TEC integrity,
while also restoring cell proliferation, dedifferentiation-associated repair and 
regeneration of the kidney parenchyma and attenuating interstitial fibrosis.
Thus, inhibition of the EMT program in TECs during chronic renal injury
represents a potential anti-fibrosis therapy.

A hallmark of liver fibrosis is the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSC),
which results in their production of fibrotic molecules, a process that is
largely regulated by connective tissue growth factor (CCN2). CCN2 is increasingly
expressed during HSC activation because of diminished expression of microRNA-214 
(miR-214), a product of dynamin 3 opposite strand (DNM3os) that directly
suppresses CCN2 mRNA. We show that an E-box in the miR-214 promoter binds the
basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, Twist1, which drives miR-214
expression and results in CCN2 suppression. Twist1 expression was suppressed in
HSC of fibrotic livers or in cultured HSC undergoing activation in vitro or after
treatment with ethanol. Furthermore, Twist1 decreasingly interacted with DNM3os
as HSC underwent activation in vitro. Nanovesicular exosomes secreted by
quiescent but not activated HSC contained high levels of Twist1, thus reflecting 
the suppression of cellular Twist1 during HSC activation. Exosomal Twist1 was
intercellularly shuttled between HSC and stimulated expression of miR-214 in the 
recipient cells, causing expression of CCN2 and its downstream effectors to be
suppressed. Additionally, the miR-214 E-box in HSC was also regulated by
hepatocyte-derived exosomes, showing that functional transfer of exosomal Twist1 
occurs between different cell types. Finally, the levels of Twist1, miR-214, or
CCN2 in circulating exosomes from fibrotic mice reflected fibrosis-induced
changes in the liver itself, highlighting the potential utility of these and
other constituents in serum exosomes as novel circulating biomarkers for liver
fibrosis. These findings reveal a unique function for cellular or exosomal Twist1
in CCN2-dependent fibrogenesis.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is an aggressive disease accounting for more 
than 260,000 cancer cases diagnosed and 128,000 deaths worldwide. A large
majority of cancer deaths result from cancers that have metastasized beyond the
primary tumor. The relationship between genetic changes and clinical outcome can 
reflect the biological events that promote cancer's aggressive behavior, and
these can serve as molecular markers for improved patient management and
survival. To this end, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a major process
that promotes tumor invasion and metastasis, making EMT-related proteins
attractive diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In this study, we used 
immunohistochemistry to study the expression of a panel of transcription factors 
(TWIST1, SNAI1/2, ZEB1 and ZEB2) and other genes intimately related to EMT (CDH1 
and LAMC2) at the invasive tumor front of OSCC tissues. The association between
the expression of these proteins and clinico-pathological parameters were
examined with Pearson Chi-square and correlation with survival was analyzed using
Kaplan Meier analysis. Our results demonstrate that there was a significant
differential expression of CDH1, LAMC2, SNAI1/2 and TWIST1 between OSCC and
normal oral mucosa (NOM). Specifically, CDH1 loss was significantly associated
with Broder's grading, while diffused LAMC2 was similarly associated with
non-cohesive pattern of invasion. Notably, co-expression of TWIST1 and ZEB2 in
OSCC was significantly associated with poorer overall survival, particularly in
patients without detectable lymph node metastasis. This study demonstrates that
EMT-related proteins are differentially expressed in OSCC and that the
co-expression of TWIST1 and ZEB2 could be of clinical value in identifying
patients with poor survival for appropriate patient management.

Medullary carcinoma (MC) of the colorectum is known as a rare variant with
favorable prognosis despite its poorly differentiated morphology. The mechanism
of its favorable behavior has been unclear. Here, we compared the expressions of 
adhesion molecules and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins
in the central portion and invasive front between 43 MCs and 30 poorly
differentiated adenocarcinomas (PDAs). The expressions of membranous E-cadherin
(P < .0001), ß-catenin (P < .0001) and claudin 1 (P = .0036) were significantly
preserved in the invasive front of the MCs compared to those in the invasive
front of the PDAs. E-cadherin membranous expression was also significantly
preserved in the central portion of the MCs (P = .0178). Nuclear ß-catenin
expression in both the central portion (P = .0463) and invasive front (P = .0346)
of the MCs was significantly less frequent compared to that in the PDAs. Snail (P
= .0035) and Twist1 (P = .0463) expressions in the invasive front of the MCs were
significantly less frequent compared to the PDAs, suggesting that the EMT
phenomenon may occur rarely in colorectal MC. Reduced membranous E-cadherin
expression in the MC central portion was significantly correlated with poor
clinical outcome (P = .0086). Our immunohistochemical results indicate that
preserved adhesion molecule protein and less frequent expression of EMT-related
transcription factors in the invasive front contribute to the favorable prognosis
of colorectal MCs. We suggest that a reduced expression of E-cadherin in the
central portion might be a good biomarker for an unfavorable prognosis in cases
of MC.

Aggressive tumor cells can mimic embryonic vasculogenic networks and form
vasculogenic mimicry (VM). Preliminary studies demonstrated that hypoxia can
promote VM formation; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The
present study aimed to investigate the role of the Twist1-Bmi1 connection in
hypoxia-induced VM formation and the underlying mechanism. In the in vitro
experiments, western blot analysis demonstrated that hypoxia upregulated the
expression of Twist1, Bmi1, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, stem
cell markers and VM-associated markers. The 3D culture assay showed that hypoxia 
promoted VM formation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. Using
transfection and in vitro cell experiments, the Twist1-Bmi1 connection was
confirmed to have an important role in inducing EMT, cell stemness and VM
formation. In the in vivo experiments, the murine hypoxia models were established
via incomplete femoral artery ligation and the mechanism by which hypoxia
promoted Twist1 and Bmi1 expression and led to VM formation was demonstrated by
immunohistochemistry staining and endomucin/periodic acid Schiff double-staining.
In conclusion, hypoxia upregulate the expression of Twist1 and Bmi1, and these
two proteins have an important role in inducing EMT and cancer cell stemness,
which contributed to VM formation.

Epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested that deregulated
hepcidin-ferroportin (FPN) signaling is associated with the increased risk of
cancers. However, the effects of deregulated hepcidin-FPN signaling on tumor
behaviors such as metastasis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) have 
not been closely investigated. In this study, LL/2 cancer cells were found to
exhibit an impaired propensity to home into lungs, and a reduced ability to
develop tumors was also demonstrated in lungs of Hamp1(-/-) mice. Moreover,
hepatic hepcidin deficiency was found to considerably favor tumor-free survival
in Hamp1(-/-) mice, compared with wild-type mice. These data thus underscored a
contributive role of hepatic hepcidin in promoting lung cancer cell homing and
fostering tumor progression. To explore the role of FPN in regulating tumor
progression, we genetically engineered 4T1 cells with FPN over-expression upon
induction by doxycycline. With this cell line, it was discovered that increased
FPN expression reduced cell division and colony formation in vitro, without
eliciting significant cell death. Analogously, FPN over-expression impeded tumor 
growth and metastasis to lung and liver in mice. At the molecular level, FPN
over-expression was identified to undermine DNA synthesis and cell cycle
progression. Importantly, FPN over-expression inhibited EMT, as reflected by the 
significant decrease of representative EMT markers, such as Snail1, Twist1, ZEB2,
and vimentin. Additionally, there was also a reduction of lactate production in
cells upon induction of FPN over-expression. Together, our results highlighted a 
crucial role of the hepcidin-FPN signaling in modulating tumor growth and
metastasis, providing new evidence to understand the contribution of this
signaling in cancers.

BACKGROUND: Carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs), an important component of
tumor microenvironment, are capable of enhancing tumor cells invasion and
migration through initiation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). MRC-5
fibroblasts are one of the CAFs expressing alpha-smooth muscle actin. It is
ascertained that medium conditioned by MRC-5 fibroblasts stimulate motility and
invasion of breast cancer cells. However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) is less clear. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of
MRC-5-CM on HCC and explore the underlying mechanisms.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a combination of techniques, the role of MRC-5-CM in
HCC was evaluated. We determined that MRC-5-CM induced the non-classical EMT in
Bel-7402 and MHCC-LM3 cell lines. Initiation of the non-classical EMT was mainly 
via quintessential redistribution of a-, ß- and <U+03B3>-catenin, P120 catenin,
E-cadherin, and N-cadherin, rather than up-regulation of typical EMT-related
transcription factors (i.e., Snail, Twist1, ZEB-1 and ZEB2). We also found that
MRC-5-CM potentiated both the migration and invasion of Bel-7402 and MHCC-LM3
cells in mesenchymal movement mode through activation of the a6, ß3, ß4, ß7
integrin/FAK pathway and upregulation of MMP2. The flow cytometric analysis
showed that MRC-5-CM induced G1 phase arrest in Bel-7402 cells with a concomitant
reduction of S phase cells. In contrast, MRC-5-CM induced S phase arrest in
MHCC-LM3 cells with a concomitant reduction of cells in the G2/M phase. MRC-5-CM 
also inhibited apoptosis in Bel-7402 cells while inducing apoptosis in MHCC-LM3
cells.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, MRC-5-CM promoted HCC cell motility and invasiveness
through initiation of the non-classical EMT, including redistribution of a-, ß-
and <U+03B3>-catenin, P120 catenin, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin, activation of the
integrin/FAK pathway, and upregulation of MMP2. Hence, MRC-5-CM exerted distinct 
roles in Bel-7402 and MHCC-LM3 cell viability by regulating cyclins, cyclin
dependent kinases (CDKs), CDK inhibitors (CKIs), Bcl-2 family proteins and other 
unknown mechanosensors.

BACKGROUND: Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process in which
epithelial cells lose polarity and cell-to-cell contacts and acquire the
migratory and invasive abilities of mesenchymal cells. These abilities are
thought to be prerequisites for the establishment of endometriotic lesions. A
hallmark of EMT is the functional loss of E-cadherin (CDH1) expression in
epithelial cells. TWIST1, a transcription factor that represses E-cadherin
transcription, is among the EMT inducers. SNAIL, a zinc-finger transcription
factor, and its close relative SLUG have similar properties to TWIST1 and are
thus also EMT inducers. MYC, which is upregulated by estrogens in the uterus by
an estrogen response cis-acting element (ERE) in its promoter, is associated with
proliferation in endometriosis. The role of EMT and proliferation in the
pathogenesis of endometriosis was evaluated by analyzing TWIST1, CDH1 and MYC
expression.
METHODS: CDH1, TWIST1, SNAIL and SLUG mRNA expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR
from 47 controls and 74 patients with endometriosis. Approximately 42 ectopic and
62 eutopic endometrial tissues, of which 30 were matched samples, were collected 
during the same surgical procedure. We evaluated TWIST1 and MYC protein
expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the epithelial and stromal tissue of 
69 eutopic and 90 ectopic endometrium samples, of which 49 matched samples were
analyzed from the same patient. Concordant expression of TWIST1/SNAIL/SLUG and
CDH1 but also of TWIST1 and MYC was analyzed.
RESULTS: We found that TWIST1, SNAIL and SLUG are overexpressed (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001,
p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.016 and p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) in endometriosis, while CDH1 expression was concordantly
reduced in these samples (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). Similar to TWIST1, the epithelial
expression of MYC was also significantly enhanced in ectopic endometrium compared
to eutopic tissues (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.008). We found exclusive expression of either TWIST1 or
MYC in the same samples (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Epithelial TWIST1 is overexpressed in endometriosis and may
contribute to the formation of endometriotic lesions by inducing epithelial to
mesenchymal transition, as CDH1 was reduced in ectopic lesions. We found
exclusive expression of either TWIST1 or MYC in the same samples, indicating that
EMT and proliferation contribute independently of each other to the formation of 
endometriotic lesions.

BACKGROUND: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) play a crucial role in tumor
dissemination and are an independent survival predictor in breast cancer (BC)
patients. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is involved in cancer
invasion and metastasis. The aim of this study was to assess correlation between 
CTCs and expression of EMT transcription factors TWIST1 and SLUG in breast tumor 
tissue.
METHODS: This study included 102 early BC patients treated by primary surgery.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were depleted of hematopoietic cells
using RossetteSep negative selection kit. RNA extracted from CD45-depleted PBMC 
was interrogated for expression of EMT (TWIST1, SNAIL1, SLUG, FOXC2 and ZEB1) and
epithelial (KRT19) gene transcripts by qRT-PCR. Expression of TWIST1 and SLUG in 
surgical specimens was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and quantified by
multiplicative score.
RESULTS: CTCs were detected in 24.5 % patients. CTCs exhibiting only epithelial
markers were present in 8.8 % patients, whereas CTCs with only EMT markers were
observed in 12.8 % of pts and CTCs co-expressing both markers were detected in
2.9 % pts. We observed lack of correlation between CTCs and expression of TWIST1 
and SLUG in breast cancer cells or cancer associated stroma. Lack of correlation 
was observed for epithelial CTCs as well as for CTCs with EMT.
CONCLUSIONS: In this translational study, we showed a lack of association between
CTCs and expression of EMT-inducing transcription factors, TWIST1 and SLUG, in
breast tumor tissue. Despite the fact that EMT is involved in cancer invasion and
metastasis our results suggest, that expression of EMT proteins in unselected
tumor tissue is not surrogate marker of CTCs with either mesenchymal or
epithelial features.

BACKGROUND: The airway epithelial cell plays a central role in coordinating the
pulmonary response to injury and inflammation. Here, transforming growth factor-ß
(TGFß) activates gene expression programs to induce stem cell-like properties,
inhibit expression of differentiated epithelial adhesion proteins and express
mesenchymal contractile proteins. This process is known as epithelial mesenchymal
transition (EMT); although much is known about the role of EMT in cellular
metastasis in an oncogene-transformed cell, less is known about Type II EMT, that
occurring in normal epithelial cells. In this study, we applied next generation
sequencing (RNA-Seq) in primary human airway epithelial cells to understand the
gene program controlling Type II EMT and how cytokine-induced inflammation
modifies it.
RESULTS: Generalized linear modeling was performed on a two-factor RNA-Seq
experiment of 6 treatments of telomerase immortalized human small airway
epithelial cells (3 replicates). Using a stringent cut-off, we identified 3,478
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to EMT. Unbiased transcription 
factor enrichment analysis identified three clusters of EMT regulators, one
including SMADs/TP63 and another NF-<U+03BA>B/RelA. Surprisingly, we also observed 527
of the EMT DEGs were also regulated by the TNF-NF-<U+03BA>B/RelA pathway. This Type II
EMT program was compared to Type III EMT in TGFß stimulated A549 alveolar lung
cancer cells, revealing significant functional differences. Moreover, we observe 
that Type II EMT modifies the outcome of the TNF program, reducing IFN signaling 
and enhancing integrin signaling. We confirmed experimentally that TGFß-induced
the NF-<U+03BA>B/RelA pathway by observing a 2-fold change in NF-<U+03BA>B/RelA nuclear
translocation. A small molecule IKK inhibitor blocked TGFß-induced core
transcription factor (SNAIL1, ZEB1 and Twist1) and mesenchymal gene (FN1 and VIM)
expression.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that NF-<U+03BA>B/RelA controls a SMAD-independent gene
network whose regulation is required for initiation of Type II EMT. Type II EMT
dramatically affects the induction and kinetics of TNF-dependent gene networks.

Copper, a strictly regulated trace element, is essential for many physiological
processes including angiogenesis. Dysregulated angiogenesis has been associated
with increased copper in tumors, and thus copper chelators have been used to
inhibit tumor angiogenesis. However, it remains unclear whether copper has any
effect on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Using CoCl2-induced EMT of
human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells, we found that TEPA, a copper chelator,
inhibited EMT-like cell morphology and cytoskeleton arrangement triggered by
CoCl2; decreased the expression of vimentin and fibronectin, markers typical of
EMT; inhibited HIF-1 activation and HIF1-a accumulation in nuclear; and
down-regulated the expression of hypoxia-associated transcription factors, Snail 
and Twist1. Moreover, knockdown copper transport protein, Ctr1, also inhibited
CoCl2-induced EMT and reversed the mesenchymal phenotype. In EMT6 xenograft mouse
models, TEPA administration inhibited the tumor growth and increased mice
survival. Immunohistochemical analysis of the xenograft further demonstrated that
TEPA administration significantly inhibited tumor angiogenesis, down-regulated
hypoxia-induced transcription factors, Snail and Twist1, leading to decreased
transactivation of EMT-associated marker genes, vimentin and fibronectin. These
results indicate that TEPA inhibits CoCl2-induced EMT most likely via
HIF1-a-Snail/Twist signaling pathway, and copper depletion may be exploited as a 
therapeutic for breast cancer.

AIMS AND METHODS: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has previously been
linked to glioma invasion and progression. To determine whether EMT regulators,
Twist and Zeb1, had clinical significance in astrocytic gliomas, the association 
of Twist and Zeb1 with clinicopathological and molecular factors was studied in
269 astrocytoma samples.
RESULTS: Twist and Zeb1 were widely expressed in astrocytic gliomas, but the
expression of the former did not correlate with that of the latter. Stronger
Twist expression levels were associated with higher WHO grades (p=0.001), whereas
Zeb1 did not correlate with WHO grades. We found no association between Twist and
proliferation activity (Ki67/MIB-1), p53 status, epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) amplification or neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) expression. There
was no significant difference in Twist or Zeb1 expression when primary and
secondary gliomas were analysed. Tumours with high Twist expression were IDH1
negative (p=0.009). High hypoxia-inducible factor-1a expression correlated
significantly with positive Twist expression (p<0.001), whereas it was not
associated with Zeb1 expression. Zeb1 expression did not correlate with
proliferation, EGFR or IDH1. Nevertheless, we did find a correlation between high
Zeb1 expression and low p53 expression levels (p=0.027). Positive NCAM expression
was significantly associated with Zeb1 positivity (p=0.022). Zeb1 had no
association with patient survival, whereas positive Twist expression predicted
poor survival for patients in both univariate (p<0.001) and multivariable
analyses (p=0.027).
CONCLUSIONS: EMT regulators, Twist and Zeb1, are common features of infiltrating 
astrocytomas, and Twist is upregulated in glioblastomas in particular. Twist may 
be a novel marker for poor prognosis in glioma patients.

Cancer stem-like cells (CSC) are a cell subpopulation that can reinitiate tumors,
resist chemotherapy, and give rise to metastases. Metadherin (MTDH) contributes
widely to tumor growth, drug resistance, relapse, and metastasis, but its
molecular mechanisms of action are not well understood. Here, we report that MTDH
drives CSC expansion by promoting the expression of TWIST1, a transcription
factor critical for cancer cell stemness and metastasis. MTDH activates TWIST1
expression indirectly by facilitating histone H3 acetylation on the TWIST1
promoter, a process mediated by the histone acetyltransferase CBP. Mechanistic
investigations showed that MTDH interacts with CBP and prevents its
ubiquitin-mediated degradation, licensing its transcriptional activation of
TWIST1. In clinical specimens of breast cancer, MTDH expression correlates
positively with TWIST1 expression and CSC abundance. Overall, our work revealed
that MTDH promotes CSC accumulation and breast tumorigenicity by regulating
TWIST1, deepening the understanding of MTDH function in cancer.

BACKGROUND: The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been observed in
progression of in situ breast cancer to the invasive form and might be initiated 
by snail family zinc finger 2 (SLUG) and twist family bHLH transcription factor 1
(TWIST) protein overexpression. During this phenomenon, cells lose their
epithelial phenotype and acquire mesenchymal features. The aim of the study was
to examine the association of EMT markers SLUG and TWIST with clinicopathological
data and the possibility of using these proteins as prognostic markers of breast 
cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) of SLUG and TWIST
expression was performed on archival paraffin samples of 19 cases with
fibrocystic breast changes (control group), 148 cases of invasive ductal breast
cancer (IDC) and 26 of invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC). Laser capture
microdissection for isolation of cells from 17 frozen samples of IDC was employed
and subsequently SLUG and TWIST mRNA expression in cancer and stromal cells was
detected separately by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: SLUG and TWIST expression in IDC was significant higher in stromal cells
regardless of the method of quantification used (p<0.001 for SLUG mRNA, and
p<0.0001 for SLUG IHC, TWIST IHC and TWIST mRNA expression). Positive correlation
of SLUG and TWIST protein and mRNA expression was observed in stromal cells of
IDC (r=0.347; p<0.0001 and r=0.704; p<0.01, respectively). Expression of TWIST
protein in IDC was higher in cancer cells of cases with shorter event-free
survival period, as well as in stromal cells of cases with shorter overall
survival period (p<0.05 for both).
CONCLUSION: Stromal cells could play a role in the regulation of EMT in breast
cancer.

Wnt signaling contributes to the reprogramming and maintenance of cancer stem
cell (CSC) states that are activated by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). 
However, the mechanistic relationship between EMT and the Wnt pathway in CSC is
not entirely clear. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing
(ChIP-seq) indicated that EMT induces a switch from the
ß-catenin/E-cadherin/Sox15 complex to the ß-catenin/Twist1/TCF4 complex, the
latter of which then binds to CSC-related gene promoters. Tandem
coimmunoprecipitation and re-ChIP experiments with epithelial-type cells further 
revealed that Sox15 associates with the ß-catenin/E-cadherin complex, which then 
binds to the proximal promoter region of CASP3. Through this mechanism, Twist1
cleavage is triggered to regulate a ß-catenin-elicited promotion of the CSC
phenotype. During EMT, we documented that Twist1 binding to ß-catenin enhanced
the transcriptional activity of the ß-catenin/TCF4 complex, including by binding 
to the proximal promoter region of ABCG2, a CSC marker. In terms of clinical
application, our definition of a five-gene CSC signature (nuclear
ß-catenin(High)/nuclear Twist1(High)/E-cadherin(Low)/Sox15(Low)/CD133(High)) may 
provide a useful prognostic marker for human lung cancer.

Pigs have been one of the most important sources of meat for humans, and their
productivity has been substantially improved by recent strong selection. Here, we
present whole-genome resequencing analyses of 55 pigs of five breeds representing
Korean native pigs, wild boar and three European origin breeds. 1,673.1 Gb of
sequence reads were mapped to the Swine reference assembly, covering ~99.2% of
the reference genome, at an average of ~11.7-fold coverage. We detected
20,123,573 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 25.5% were novel. We 
extracted 35,458 of non-synonymous SNPs in 9,904 genes, which may contribute to
traits of interest. The whole SNP sets were further used to access the population
structures of the breeds, using multiple methodologies, including phylogenetic,
similarity matrix, and population structure analysis. They showed clear
population clusters with respect to each breed. Furthermore, we scanned the whole
genomes to identify signatures of selection throughout the genome. The result
revealed several promising loci that might underlie economically important traits
in pigs, such as the CLDN1 and TWIST1 genes. These discoveries provide useful
genomic information for further study of the discrete genetic mechanisms
associated with economically important traits in pigs.

Growth and progression of solid tumors depend on the integration of multiple
pro-growth and survival signals, including the induction of angiogenesis. TWIST1 
is a transcription factor whose reactivation in tumors leads to epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT), including increased cancer cell stemness, survival,
and invasiveness. Additionally, TWIST1 drives angiogenesis via activation of IL-8
and CCL2, independent of VEGF signaling. In this work, results suggest that
chemically modified siRNA against TWIST1 reverses EMT both in vitro and in vivo. 
siRNA delivery with a polyethyleneimine-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticle
(MSN) led to reduction of TWIST1 target genes and migratory potential in vitro.
In mice bearing xenograft tumors, weekly intravenous injections of the
siRNA-nanoparticle complexes resulted in decreased tumor burden together with a
loss of CCL2 suggesting a possible anti-angiogenic response. Therapeutic use of
TWIST1 siRNA delivered via MSNs has the potential to inhibit tumor growth and
progression in many solid tumor types.FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: Tumor progression
and metastasis eventually lead to patient mortality in the clinical setting. In
other studies, it has been found that TWIST1, a transcription factor, if
reactivated in tumors, would lead to downstream events including angiogenesis and
result in poor prognosis in cancer patients. In this article, the authors were
able to show that when siRNA against TWIST1 was delivered via mesoporous silica
nanoparticle, there was tumor reduction in an in-vivo model. The results have
opened up a new avenue for further research in this field.

The authors present a new and unique pattern of sutural fusion "peace sign
synostosis" (PSS) characterized by synostosis of the metopic, bicoronal, and
sagittal sutures and associated with abnormalities of the TWIST1 gene known to be
associated with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS). To do so, we performed a
retrospective review of patients with bicoronal, metopic, and at least partial
anterior sagittal synostoses at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and
Seattle Children's Hospital. Patients' demographics, genetic analysis,
perioperative and clinic notes were reviewed. Five patients were identified with 
PSS and abnormalities of TWIST1 consistent with SCS. One patient, with the
longest follow-up of 7 years, underwent 5 intracranial procedures and required a 
ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. The remaining 4 patients underwent posterior
cranial vault distraction as the initial procedure, followed by anterior cranial 
vault remodeling. Two patients required a VP shunt. To conclude, synostosis of
the metopic, bicoronal, and sagittal sutures (PSS) appears to be associated with 
SCS and produces a characteristic skull morphology that can be readily identified
on physical examination. Early data suggest a high rate of reoperation, increased
necessity for a VP shunt, and potential complications. Of note, this novel
phenotype had not been previously observed at our respective institutions,
reported in the literature, or observed in association with TWIST1 abnormalities 
as described in association with SCS.

In the last few years, the role of epithelial cell plasticity in cancer biology
research has gained increasing attention. This concept refers to the ability of
the epithelial cells to dynamically switch between different phenotypic cellular 
states. This programme is particularly relevant during the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer progression. During
colonization, epithelial cells first activate the EMT programme to disseminate
from a primary tumour to reach a distant tissue site. During this process, cells 
are transported into the circulation and are able to escape the immune system of 
the host. Then, a reverse process called mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition
(MET) occurs on cells that settle in the distant organs. Although epithelial cell
plasticity has an important impact on tumour biology, the clinical relevance of
this concept remains to be recapitulated. In this review, we will update the
current state of epithelial cell plasticity in cancer progression and its
clinical implications for the design of therapeutic strategies, the acquisition
of multidrug resistance, and future perspectives for the management of cancer
patients.

Craniosynostosis is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition.
Knowledge of the specific genetic diagnosis in patients presenting with this
condition is important for surgical and medical management. The most common
single gene causes of syndromic craniosynostosis are mutations in FGFR1, FGFR2,
FGFR3, TWIST1, and EFNB1. Recently, a new single gene cause of craniosynostosis
was published, together with phenotype data that highlight the clinical
importance of making this specific molecular diagnosis. Phenotypic features of
"ERF-related craniosynostosis" include sagittal or multiple-suture synostosis,
Chiari malformation, and language delay. In order to determine the contribution
of ERF mutations to genetically undiagnosed patients with craniosynostosis, we
sequenced the coding regions of ERF in 40 patients with multi-suture or sagittal 
suture synostosis. We identified heterozygous ERF mutations in two individuals
(5%). One mutation positive individual had pansynostosis, while the second had
bilateral coronal and metopic synostosis. Both presented in infancy or childhood 
(age 3 months, and 6 years 9 months, respectively). One had CNS abnormalities
including Chiari I malformation. Dysmorphic features included hypertelorism,
proptosis, depressed nasal bridge, and retrognathia, in keeping with previously
reported cases. The individuals did not require repeated cranial surgeries.
ERF-related craniosynostosis should be suspected in patients presenting with
multiple suture or sagittal synostosis.

Twist1 is an evolutionally conserved transcription factor. Originally identified 
in Drosophila as a key regulator for mesoderm development, it was later
implicated in many human diseases, including Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and cancer.
Twist1's involvement in cancer has been well recognized. Driven by
hypoxia-induced factor-1 (HIF-1), Twist1 has been considered as a proto-oncogene 
and its overexpression has been observed in a wide variety of human cancers. High
expression level of Twist1 is closely related to tumor aggressiveness and
metastatic potential. In cancer cells, Twist1 has been shown to function as a key
regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a critical process for
metastasis initiation. Twist1 has also been implicated in maintaining cancer
stemness for self-renewal and chemoresistance. This review first summarizes the
roles of Twist1 in embryo development and Saethre-Chotzen syndrome followed by a 
discussion of Twist1's critical functions in cancer. In particular, the review
focuses on the recent discovery of Twist1's capability to promote endothelial
transdifferentiation of cancer cells beyond EMT.

BACKGROUND: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which involves changes in
cellular morphology of highly polarized epithelial cells and the gain of
mesenchymal cell phenotype with migratory and invasive capacities, is implicated 
in smoking-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the
interactions of fibroblasts and epithelial cells and the participation of
fibroblasts in the EMT processes in COPD are poorly understood. Here, we
investigated the hypothesis that EMT is active in human bronchial epithelial
(HBE) cells of COPD patients, and that mediators secreted by lung fibroblasts
from COPD patients induce EMT.
METHODS: Primary HBE cells from normal subjects and COPD patients were purchased 
from LONZA. HLFs were derived from resected lung obtained from normal (N) and
COPD (D) subjects and their conditioned medium (CM) was collected after 2-day
culture in serum-free medium. The expression of epithelial and mesenchymal
markers as well as EMT-related transcription factors in lung biopsies, and in HBE
cells following stimulation with CM from both normal human lung fibroblasts
(NHLF) and COPD human lung fibroblasts (DHLF) was evaluated by
immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR and western blot.
RESULTS: Basal mRNA expression of mesenchymal markers and EMT-related
transcription factors were increased in DHBE cells compared to normal human
bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) cells as well as in COPD lungs. CM from NHLF
significantly induced vimentin expression in both NHBE and COPD human bronchial
epithelial cells (DHBE) cells, but only increased N-cadherin expression in DHBE
cells. CM from NHLF significantly induced Twist1 and Twist2 expression in NHBE
cells and increased Snai2 (Slug) expression in DHBE cells. While CM from NHLF had
no effect on such EMT markers, CM from DHLF significantly increased the protein
expression of E-cadherin and vimentin in NHBE cells compared to control.
N-cadherin expression was upregulated to a greater degree in NHBE cells than DHBE
cells. Only CM from DHLF significantly increased E-/N-cadherin ratio in DHBE
cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that DHBE cells have partially undergone EMT
under baseline conditions. DHLF-CM promoted EMT in NHBE, suggesting that
interactions between fibroblast and epithelial cells may play an important role
in the EMT process in COPD.

Dysregulation of the EGFR signaling axis enhances bone metastases in many solid
cancers. However, the relevant downstream effector signals in this axis are
unclear. miR-1 was recently shown to function as a tumor suppressor in prostate
cancer cells, where its expression correlated with reduced metastatic potential. 
In this study, we demonstrated a role for EGFR translocation in regulating
transcription of miR-1-1, which directly targets expression of TWIST1. Consistent
with these findings, we observed decreased miR-1 levels that correlated with
enhanced expression of activated EGFR and TWIST1 in a cohort of human prostate
cancer specimens and additional datasets. Our findings support a model in which
nuclear EGFR acts as a transcriptional repressor to constrain the
tumor-suppressive role of miR-1 and sustain oncogenic activation of TWIST1,
thereby leading to accelerated bone metastasis.

Change in the host and/or human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA methylation profile is
probably one of the main factors responsible for the malignant progression of
cervical lesions to cancer. To investigate those changes we studied 173 cervical 
samples with different grades of cervical lesion, from normal to cervical cancer.
The methylation status of nine cellular gene promoters, CCNA1, CDH1, C13ORF18,
DAPK1, HIC1, RARß2, hTERT1, hTERT2 and TWIST1, was investigated by Methylation
Specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (MSP). The methylation of HPV18 L1-gene was
also investigated by MSP, while the methylated cytosines within four regions, L1,
5'LCR, enhancer, and promoter of the HPV16 genome covering 19 CpG sites were
evaluated by bisulfite sequencing. Statistically significant methylation
biomarkers distinguishing between cervical precursor lesions from normal cervix
were primarily C13ORF18 and secondly CCNA1, and those distinguishing cervical
cancer from normal or cervical precursor lesions were CCNA1, C13ORF18, hTERT1,
hTERT2 and TWIST1. In addition, the methylation analysis of individual CpG sites 
of the HPV16 genome in different sample groups, notably the 7455 and 7694 sites, 
proved to be more important than the overall methylation frequency. The majority 
of HPV18 positive samples contained both methylated and unmethylated L1 gene, and
samples with L1-gene methylated forms alone had better prognosis when correlated 
with the host cell gene promoters' methylation profiles. In conclusion, both
cellular and viral methylation biomarkers should be used for monitoring cervical 
lesion progression to prevent invasive cervical cancer.

BACKGROUND: Much effort has been devoted to determining how metastatic cells and 
microenvironment reciprocally interact. However, the role of biological stimuli
of microenvironment in controlling molecular events in bone metastasis from
breast carcinoma for mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) is largely unknown. 
The purpose of the present paper was to clarify (1) the influence of
hepatocyte-growth factor (HGF) and transforming growth factorß1 (TGFß1) on the
phenotype of bone-metastatic 1833 and parental MDA-MB231 cells; (2) the
hierarchic response of Twist and Snail controlled by Wwox co-factor, that might
be critical for the control of 1833-adhesive properties via E-cadherin.
METHODS: We studied under HGF and TGFß1 the gene profiles-responsible for
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), versus the revertant MET
phenotype-making the correspondence with 1833 morphology and the relation to
HGF-dependent control of TGFß1 signalling. In particular, the activation of Twist
program and the underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated, considering
the role of endogenous and exogenous Wwox with siRNAWWOX and the expression
vector transfection, to clarify whether Twist affected E-cadherin transactivation
through a network of transcription factors and regulators.
RESULTS: HGF and TGFß1 oppositely affected the expression of Wwox in 1833 cells. 
Under HGF, endogenous Wwox decreased concomitant with Twist access to nuclei and 
its phosphorylation via PI3K/Akt pathway. Twist activated by HGF did not
influence the gene profile through an E-box mechanism, but participated in the
interplay of PPAR<U+03B3>/Ets1/NF-kB-transcription factors, triggering E-cadherin
transactivation. Altogether, HGF conferred MET phenotype to 1833 cells, even if
this was transient since followed by TGFß1-signalling activation. TGFß1 induced
Snail in both the cell lines, with E-cadherin down-regulation only in 1833 cells 
because in MDA-MB231 cells E-cadherin was practically absent. Exogenous Wwox
activated metastatic HIF-1, with Twist as co-factor.
CONCLUSIONS: HGF and TGFß1 of bone-metastasis microenvironment acted
co-ordinately, influencing non redundant pathways regulated by Twist program or
Snail-transcription factor, with reversible MET switch. This process implicated
different roles for Wwox in the various steps of the metastatic process including
colonization, with microenvironmental/exogenous Wwox that activated HIF-1,
important for E-cadherin expression. Interfering with the Twist program by
targeting the pre-metastatic niche stimuli could be an effective anti-bone
metastasis therapy.

Spontaneous canine head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents an
excellent model of human HNSCC but is greatly understudied. To better understand 
and utilize this valuable resource, we performed a pilot study that represents
its first genome-wide characterization by investigating 12 canine HNSCC cases, of
which 9 are oral, via high density array comparative genomic hybridization and
RNA-seq. The analyses reveal that these canine cancers recapitulate many
molecular features of human HNSCC. These include analogous genomic copy number
abnormality landscapes and sequence mutation patterns, recurrent alteration of
known HNSCC genes and pathways (e.g., cell cycle, PI3K/AKT signaling), and
comparably extensive heterogeneity. Amplification or overexpression of protein
kinase genes, matrix metalloproteinase genes, and epithelial-mesenchymal
transition genes TWIST1 and SNAI1 are also prominent in these canine tumors. This
pilot study, along with a rapidly growing body of literature on canine cancer,
reemphasizes the potential value of spontaneous canine cancers in HNSCC basic and
translational research.

OBJECTIVES: We previously reported a clinical trial in which we were unable to
replicate the excellent diagnostic metrics produced in the developmental study of
the TWIST1 and NID2 gene methylation assay. In this expanded trial with subjects 
enrolled from another institution, we reexamine the diagnostic capabilities of
the test to externally validate our previous study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: TWIST1 and NID2 gene methylation was assessed in DNA
isolated from the urine of subjects at risk of bladder cancer undergoing
cystoscopy for hematuria or bladder cancer surveillance. The diagnostic gold
standard was cystoscopy. Two thresholds of TWIST1 and NID2 gene methylation were 
used for determining test result positivity, those published by Renard et al. and
Abern et al. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive
values, diagnostic likelihood ratios, and receiver operating characteristic
curves were calculated for each gene, as well as their combination. In all, 3
methods were used to combine TWIST1 and NID2 into a single composite test: (1)
believe-the-positive decision rule-if either gene is methylated the test result
is positive, which maximizes test sensitivity; (2) believe-the-negative decision 
rule-if either gene is not methylated the test result is negative, which
maximizes test specificity; and (3) a likelihood-based logistic regression model 
approach that balances sensitivity and specificity. Clinical utility was
determined using a decision curve analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 209 subjects were evaluated: 40% for hematuria and 60% for
bladder cancer surveillance. Approximately 75% were male, most of the prior
cancers being low-grade Ta. Using cystoscopy as the gold standard, areas under
the curve were 0.67 for TWIST1, 0.64 for NID2, and 0.66 for combined TWIST1 and
NID2. Decision rule results revealed optimization of sensitivity at 67% using
Renard thresholds and specificity using the Abern thresholds at 69%. We found
improved sensitivity (78%) in current smokers. Decision curve analyses revealed
that the methylation assay provided only a modest benefit even at high
probabilities of missed cancer.
CONCLUSION: A urine DNA test measuring TWIST1 and NID2 methylation was externally
examined with a larger cohort and its results continue to be poor. These 2
biomarkers are unlikely to replace cystoscopy, but they may be worthy of study in
active smokers.

Proteins that promote epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) are associated
with cancer metastasis. Inhibition of EMT regulators may be a promising approach 
in cancer therapy. In this study, Thymoquinone (TQ) was used to treat cancer cell
lines to investigate its effects on EMT-regulatory proteins and cancer
metastasis. We show that TQ inhibited cancer cell growth, migration and invasion 
in a dose-dependent manner. At the molecular level, TQ treatment decreased the
transcriptional activity of the TWIST1 promoter and the mRNA expression of
TWIST1, an EMT-promoting transcription factor. Accordingly, TQ treatment also
decreased the expression of TWIST1-upregulated genes such as N-Cadherin and
increased the expression of TWIST1-repressed genes such as E-Cadherin, resulting 
in a reduction of cell migration and invasion. TQ treatment also inhibited the
growth and metastasis of cancer cell-derived xenograft tumors in mice but
partially attenuated the migration and invasion in TWIST1-overexpressed cell
lines. Furthermore, we found that TQ treatment enhanced the promoter DNA
methylation of the TWIST1 gene in BT 549 cells. Together, these results
demonstrate that TQ treatment inhibits TWIST1 promoter activity and decreases its
expression, leading to the inhibition of cancer cell migration, invasion and
metastasis. These findings suggest TQ as a potential small molecular inhibitor of
cancer growth and metastasis.

Periostin Mediates TGF-ß-Induced Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition in Prostate
Cancer Cells.

(1)Department of Urology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.

BACKGROUND: In our previous study, we found that periostin was upregulated in
prostate cancer, and its expression could be modulated by TGF-ß. TGF-ß could
upregulate periostin expression in some cells, and both TGF-ß and periostin could
induce epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). We aimed to study the effect of
periostin in the process of TGF-ß-induced EMT in prostate cancer cells.
METHODS: We constructed a lentivirus vector containing the periostin gene and
transduced it into PC3 and DU145 cells. After confirming periostin overexpression
by PCR and Western blotting, we used an MTT assay to establish a growth curve to 
measure cell proliferation. Additionally, we performed transwell and wound
healing assays to measure cell invasion and migration, respectively. Lastly, we
measured the expression of EMT associated factors using Western blot analysis to 
test the effect of periostin on EMT in prostate cancer cells.
RESULTS: PCR and Western blot analyses confirmed that periostin was upregulated
after infection with the periostin lentiviral vector. Periostin overexpression
promoted increased cell proliferation, invasion, and migration as measured by
MTT, transwell, and wound healing assays, respectively. Western blot analysis
illustrated that periostin overexpression increased the expression of EMT
associated factors, and periostin overexpression activated Akt and GSK-3ß, which 
could be inhibited using a PI3K inhibitor. Additionally, TGF-ß increased the
levels of STAT3, Twist1 and periostin, while both STAT3 shRNA and Twist1 shRNA
inhibited periostin expression. However, STAT3 shRNA also decreased Twist1
expression. Although reduction of STAT3, Twist1 or periostin levels with shRNA
inhibited TGF-ß-induced overexpression of EMT associated factors, periostin
overexpression could reverse such inhibition by interfering with STAT3 and
Twist1. Similarly, periostin overexpression also reversed inhibition of cell
invasion induced by interference of STAT3 and Twist1.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that periostin is an important mediator of
TGF-ß-induced EMT and suggest that periostin is a potential therapeutic target

Proper regulation of microbial-induced cytokines is critical to intestinal immune
homeostasis. Acute stimulation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2
(NOD2), the Crohn's disease-associated sensor of bacterial peptidoglycan, induces
cytokines. However, chronic NOD2 stimulation in macrophages decreases cytokines
upon pattern recognition receptor (PRR) restimulation; cytokine attenuation to
PRR stimulation is similarly observed in intestinal macrophages. The role for the
transcriptional repressors Twist1 and Twist2 in regulating PRR-induced cytokine
outcomes is poorly understood and has not been reported for NOD2. We found that
Twist1 and Twist2 were required for optimal cytokine downregulation during acute 
and, particularly, chronic NOD2 stimulation of human macrophages. Consistently,
Twist1 and Twist2 expression was increased after chronic NOD2 stimulation; this
increased expression was IL-10 and TGF-ß dependent. Although Twist1 and Twist2
did not coregulate each other's expression, they cooperated to enhance binding to
cytokine promoters after chronic NOD2 stimulation. Moreover, Twist1 and Twist2
contributed to enhance expression and promoter binding of the proinflammatory
inhibitor c-Maf and the transcriptional repressor Bmi1. Restoring c-Maf and Bmi1 
expression in Twist-deficient macrophages restored NOD2-induced cytokine
downregulation. Furthermore, with chronic NOD2 stimulation, Twist1 and Twist2
contributed to the decreased expression and cytokine promoter binding of the
transcriptional activators activating transcription factor 4, C/EBPa, Runx1, and 
Runx2. Knockdown of these transcriptional activators in Twist-deficient
macrophages restored cytokine downregulation after chronic NOD2 stimulation.
Finally, NOD2 synergized with additional PRRs to increase Twist1 and Twist2
expression and Twist-dependent pathways. Therefore, after chronic NOD2
stimulation Twist1 and Twist2 coordinate the regulation of both transcriptional
activators and repressors, thereby mediating optimal cytokine downregulation.

of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas. (2)Department of Nutritional Sciences, College

In the present study, we evaluated the effect of deleting Twist1 on keratinocyte 
proliferation and on skin tumor development using the two-stage chemical
carcinogenesis model. BK5.Cre<U+2009>×<U+2009>Twist1(flox/flox) mice, which have a
keratinocyte-specific Twist1 knockout (Twist1 KO), developed significantly
reduced numbers of papilloma (70% reduction) and squamous cell carcinoma (75%
reduction) as well as delayed tumor latency compared to wild-type (WT) mice.
Interestingly, knockdown of Twist1 in primary keratinocytes impeded cell cycle
progression at the G1/S transition that coincided with reduced levels of the cell
cycle proteins c-Myc, Cyclin E1, and E2F1 and increased levels of p53 and p21.
Furthermore, ChIP analyses revealed that Twist1 bound to the promoter regions of 
Cyclin E1, E2F1, and c-Myc at the canonical E-box binding motif suggesting a
direct transcriptional regulation. Further analyses of Twist1 KO mice revealed a 
significant reduction in the number of label-retaining cells as well as the
number of a6-integrin(+) /CD34(+) cells in the hair follicles of untreated mice
compared to WT mice. These mice also exhibited significantly reduced epidermal
proliferation in response to TPA treatment that again correlated with reduced
levels of cell cycle regulators and increased levels of p53 and p21. Finally,
Twist1 deficiency in keratinocytes led to an upregulation of p53 via its
stabilization and nuclear localization, which is responsible for the increased
expression of p21 in these cells. Collectively, these findings indicate that
Twist1 has a novel role in epithelial carcinogenesis by regulating proliferation 
of keratinocytes, including keratinocyte stem cells during tumor promotion. ©

Nobiletin inhibited hypoxia-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition of lung
cancer cells by inactivating of Notch-1 signaling and switching on miR-200b.

Gao XJ, Liu JW, Zhang QG, Zhang JJ, Xu HT, Liu HJ.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an early step in the process of tumor 
metastasis. It is well known that tumor microenvironment affects malignancy in
various carcinomas; in particular, that hypoxia induces EMT. Deregulated notch
signaling also contributes a lot to the development of EMT in lung cancer. In
this study, we investigated the use of Notch-1-inhibiting compound as novel
therapeutic candidates to regulate hypoxia-induced EMT in lung cancer cells.
According to previous screening, nobiletin was selected as a Notch-1 inhibitor.
Hypoxia-induced EMT was characteristic of increased N-cadherin & vimentin
expressions and decreased E-cadherin expressions. Treatment with nobiletin
notably attenuated hypoxia-induced EMT, invasion and migration in H1299 cells,
accompanied with reduced Notch-1, Jagged1/2 expressions and its downstream genes 
Hey-1 and Hes-1. Nobiletin treatment also promoted tumorsuppressive miR-200b
level. Moreover, notch-1 siRNA prevented hypoxia-mediated cell migration and
decreased Twist1, Snail1, and ZEB1/2 expressions, which are key EMT markers.
Re-expression of miR-200b blocked hypoxia-induced EMT and cell invasion. Our
findings suggest that downregulation of Notch-1 and reexpression of miR-200b by
nobiletin might be a novel remedy for the therapy of lung cancer.

The estrogen receptor (ER) ß variant ERß2 is expressed in aggressive
castration-resistant prostate cancer and has been shown to correlate with
decreased overall survival. Genome-wide expression analysis after ERß2 expression
in prostate cancer cells revealed that hypoxia was an overrepresented theme. Here
we show that ERß2 interacts with and stabilizes HIF-1a protein in normoxia,
thereby inducing a hypoxic gene expression signature. HIF-1a is known to
stimulate metastasis by increasing expression of Twist1 and increasing
vascularization by directly activating VEGF expression. We found that ERß2
interacts with HIF-1a and piggybacks to the HIF-1a response element present on
the proximal Twist1 and VEGF promoters. These findings suggest that at least part
of the oncogenic effects of ERß2 is mediated by HIF-1a and that targeting of this
ERß2 - HIF-1a interaction may be a strategy to treat prostate cancer.

BACKGROUND: There is evidence that tumour-stroma interactions have a major role
in the neoplastic progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Tumour 
budding is thought to reflect the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT); however, the relationship between tumour buds and EMT remains unclear.
Here we characterize the tumour-budding- and stromal cells in PDAC at protein and
mRNA levels concerning factors involved in EMT.
METHODS: mRNA in situ hybridisation and immunostaining for E-cadherin, ß-catenin,
SNAIL1, ZEB1, ZEB2, N-cadherin and TWIST1 were assessed in the main tumour,
tumour buds and tumour stroma on multipunch tissue microarrays from 120
well-characterised PDACs and associated with the clinicopathological features,
including peritumoural (PTB) and intratumoural (ITB) budding.
RESULTS: Tumour-budding cells showed increased levels of ZEB1 (P<0.0001) and ZEB2
(P=0.0119) and reduced E-cadherin and ß-catenin (P<0.0001, each) compared with
the main tumour. Loss of membranous ß-catenin in the main tumour (P=0.0009) and
tumour buds (P=0.0053), without nuclear translocation, as well as increased
SNAIL1 in tumour and stromal cells (P=0.0002, each) correlated with high PTB.
ZEB1 overexpression in the main tumour-budding and stromal cells was associated
with high ITB (P=0.0084; 0.0250 and 0.0029, respectively) and high PTB (P=0.0005;
0.0392 and 0.0007, respectively). ZEB2 overexpression in stromal cells correlated
with higher pT stage (P=0.03), lymphatic invasion (P=0.0172) and lymph node
metastasis (P=0.0152).
CONCLUSIONS: In the tumour microenvironment of phenotypically aggressive PDAC,
tumour-budding cells express EMT hallmarks at protein and mRNA levels underlining
their EMT-type character and are surrounded by stromal cells expressing high
levels of the E-cadherin repressors ZEB1, ZEB2 and SNAIL1, this being strongly
associated with the tumour-budding phenotype. Moreover, our findings suggest the 
existence of subtypes of stromal cells in PDAC with phenotypical and functional
heterogeneity.

NANOG is a key pluripotency factor in embryonic stem cells that is frequently
expressed in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). However, a direct link between
NANOG and SCCs remains to be established. Here, we show that inducible
overexpression of NANOG in mouse skin epithelia favours the malignant conversion 
of skin papillomas induced by chemical carcinogenesis, leading to increased SCC
formation. Gene expression analyses in pre-malignant skin indicate that NANOG
induces genes associated to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Some of
these genes are directly activated by NANOG, including EMT-associated genes Zeb1,
Zeb2, Twist1, Prrx1 and miR-21. Finally, endogenous NANOG binds to the promoters 
of theses genes in human SCC cells and, moreover, NANOG induces EMT features in
primary keratinocytes. These results provide in vivo evidence for the oncogenic
role of NANOG in squamous cell carcinomas.

The aim of this study was to investigate the possible genetic effect of sequence 
variations in TWIST1 on the pathogenesis of ventricular septal defect in humans. 
We examined the coding region of TWIST1 in a cohort of 196 Chinese people with
non-syndromic ventricular septal defect patients and 200 healthy individuals as
the controls. We identified two novel potential disease-associated mutations,
NM_000474.3:c.247G>A (G83S) and NM_000474.3:c.283A>G (S95G). Both of them were
identified for the first time and were not observed in the 200 controls without
congenital heart disease. Using a dual-luciferase reporter assay, we showed that 
both of the mutations significantly down-regulated the repressive effect of
TWIST1 on the E-cadherin promoter. Furthermore, a mammalian two-hybrid assay
showed that both of the mutations significantly affected the interaction between 
TWIST1 and KAT2B. New mutations in the transcription factor TWIST1 that affect
protein function were identified in 1.0 % (2/196) of Chinese patients with
ventricular septal defect. Our data show, for the first time, that TWIST1 has a
potential causative effect on the development of ventricular septal defect.

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women in the world.
Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) was not only found to
play a key role in the development of tumor angiogenesis, but has also been
located in tumor cells of a variety of tumors. This study investigated the
expression pattern of VEGFR-2 in breast cancer tissue specimens in order to
evaluate the role of VEGFR-2 in the prognosis of breast cancer. Expression and
localization of VEGFR-2 in tumor cells of breast cancer specimens from 98
invasive breast cancer patients were determined by immunohistochemistry. The
relationships between VEGFR-2 expression and clinicopathological features were
also analyzed. The results showed that VEGFR-2 expression correlated positively
with lymph node (LN) metastasis of breast cancer. Patients with high expression
of VEGFR-2 had a significantly worse OS. It was also observed that the expression
of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker, including Twist1 and Vimentin,
was higher in the tumors with higher VEGFR-2 expression, while the E-cadherin
expression was lower in the same tumors, suggesting that VEGFR-2 may serve as a
possible mediator of EMT in breast cancer.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Pituitary adenomas are brain tumors with invasive properties.
Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) is a cellular process linked to the
transformation to an aggressive cancer phenotype. In the present study, we
investigated the expression of a panel of EMT markers, namely E-cadherin,
N-cadherin, SLUG, SNA1 and TWIST in a cohort of human pituitary adenomas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fresh-frozen human pituitary tumors (n=95) were collected 
immediately after surgery for histology. Gene transcripts of the EMT markers were
quantified using quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Levels of
expression were analyzed against clinical, pathological, invasion and endocrine
functions.
RESULTS: Levels of E-cadherin and N-cadherin had a negative and positive
correlation with the appearance of intratumoral cystic lesions of pituitary
tumors. E-cadherin and TWIST were associated with tumor size and staging. There
was a significant link between SLUG/TWIST and the destruction of the sella fosa
bones (p<0.030). EMT markers also showed links with the endocrine functions of
pituitary tumors. In pituitary tumors, SLUG and SNA1 had significant correlation 
with N-cadherin.
CONCLUSION: EMT markers are significant indicators of the appearance of cystic
lesions, tumor progression, bone destruction and endocrine functions. These
markers are valuable biomarkers in assessing the clinical course of pituitary
adenomas.

BACKGROUND: The overall prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients is
unsatisfactory due to cancer metastasis after operation. This study aims to
investigate the clinical significance of plasma osteopontin (OPN) levels as
minimally invasive, predictive, and surrogate biomarkers for prognosis of CRC
patients.
METHODS: This randomized study design consists of pre-operative and
post-operative plasma samples from a total of 79 patients. We determined plasma
levels of OPN by ELISA and examined their correlation with the
clinicopathological parameters of CRC patients. The effects of endogenous and
exogenous OPN on CRC metastasis were investigated by examination of the effect on
regulators of epithelial to messenchymal transition and migration assay.
RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated for the first time the clinical correlation of
plasma OPN with metastasis of CRC patients. High post-operative plasma OPN level 
(>153.02 ng/ml) associated with development of metastasis after curative
resection (p<0.001). Moreover, post-operative plasma OPN level correlated with
disease-free survival of CRC patients (p=0.009) and was an independent factor for
predicting development of metastasis in CRC patients after curative resection
(p=0.036). Our in vitro model showed that OPN ectopic expression induced DLD1
cell migration through Snail and Twist1 overexpression and E-cadherin repression,
and secretory OPN level enhanced cell migration.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggest that post-operative plasma 
OPN correlated with post-operative metastasis, suggesting that it is a potential 
non-invasive biomarker for the development of future metastasis in CRC patients. 
In addition, OPN was shown to be involved in the metastatic process and thus
inhibition of OPN is a potential therapeutic approach to treat CRC patients.

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common type of congenital heart
disease (CHD). The single gene mutations or absences that contribute to VSD
development are well established; however, the aim of the present study was to
measure gene expression variation between VSDs and normal fetal myocardial
tissue. TWIST1, an important tumor biomarker, is a basic helix-loop-helix
transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation, migration and
differentiation in embryonic development and transformed tumor cells. Although
growing evidence demonstrates that TWIST1 participates in a variety of human
neoplastic diseases, the role of TWIST1 in VSD has remained elusive. Twenty-six
VSD fetal myocardial tissue samples and 12 normal samples at matched gestational 
weeks (22-28 weeks) were included in the present study. Using reverse
transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR, it 
was demonstrated that TWIST1 mRNA was reduced by almost two-fold in the VSD
samples compared with the normal samples. Western blot analysis also revealed
that TWIST1 expression was decreased by ~three-fold (P=0.001) in the VSD samples 
compared with that in the normal samples. Of note, five complete ventricular
(also called functionally univentricular or single ventricular) septal ageneses
were identified among the specimens. For the five complete ventricular septal
agenesis samples, similar results to those for other VSD fetal myocardial tissues
were obtained. In conclusion, the results of the present study showed that TWIST1
mRNA and protein levels were reduced in VSDs. The present study was the first, to
the best of our knowledge, to report that TWIST1 is not only a tumor biomarker,
but may also be involved in the pathogenesis of VSD.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with craniosynostosis syndromes caused by
mutations in FGFR-2, FGFR-3, and TWIST1 genes are characterized by having
prematurely fused skull sutures and skull base synchondroses, which result in a
skull deformity and are accompanied by brain anomalies, including altered white
matter microarchitecture. In this study, the reliability and reproducibility of
DTI fiber tractography was investigated in these patients. The outcomes were
compared with those of controls.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI datasets were acquired with a 1.5T MR imaging system
with 25 diffusion gradient orientations (voxel size = 1.8 × 1.8 × 3.0 mm(3),
b-value = 1000 s/mm(2)). White matter tracts studied included the following:
corpus callosum, cingulate gyrus, fornix, corticospinal tracts, and medial
cerebellar peduncle. Tract pathways were reconstructed with ExploreDTI in 58
surgically treated patients with craniosynostosis syndromes and 7 controls (age
range, 6-18 years).
RESULTS: Because of the brain deformity and abnormal ventricular shape and size, 
DTI fiber tractography was challenging to perform in patients with
craniosynostosis syndromes. To provide reliable tracts, we adapted standard
tracking protocols. Fractional anisotropy was equal to that in controls (0.44
versus 0.45 ± 0.02, P = .536), whereas mean, axial, and radial diffusivity
parameters of the mean white matter were increased in patients with
craniosynostosis syndromes (P < .001). No craniosynostosis syndrome-specific
difference in DTI properties was seen for any of the fiber tracts studied in this
work.
CONCLUSIONS: Performing DTI fiber tractography in patients with craniosynostosis 
syndromes was difficult due to partial volume effects caused by an anisotropic
voxel size and deformed brain structures. Although these patients have a normal
fiber organization, increased diffusivity parameters suggest abnormal
microstructural tissue properties of the investigated white matter tracts.

Radiotherapy is a widely used treatment for many tumors. Combination therapy
using anti-angiogenic agents and radiation has shown promise; however, these
combined therapies are reported to have many limitations in clinical trials.
Here, we show that radiation transformed tumor endothelial cells (ECs) to
fibroblasts, resulting in reduced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
response and increased Snail1, Twist1, Type I collagen, and transforming growth
factor (TGF)-ß release. Irradiation of radioresistant Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) 
tumors greater than 250 mm³ increased collagen levels, particularly in large
tumor vessels. Furthermore, concomitant sunitinib therapy did not show a
significant difference in tumor inhibition versus radiation alone. Thus, we
evaluated multimodal therapy that combined pirfenidone, an inhibitor of
TGF-induced collagen production, with radiation and sunitinib treatment. This
trimodal therapy significantly reduced tumor growth, as compared to radiation
alone. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that radiation-induced collagen
deposition and tumor microvessel density were significantly reduced with trimodal
therapy, as compared to radiation alone. These data suggest that combined therapy
using pirfenidone may modulate the radiation-altered tumor microenvironment,
thereby enhancing the efficacy of radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy.

For the past 2 decades, clinical and basic science researchers have gained
significant insights into the molecular and genetic pathways associated with
common forms of craniosynostosis. This has led to invaluable information for
families and physicians in their attempts to understand the heterogeneity of
craniosynostosis. Genetic mutations have been identified in the fibroblast growth
factor receptors (FGFRs) as well as in other targets, including TWIST1, BMP, and 
RUNX2. Greater understanding of these and other pathways has led to the
development of innovative approaches for applying medical therapies to the
treatment of craniosynostosis, in particular by maintaining suture patency. In
this article, the authors discuss the molecular pathophysiological mechanisms
underlying various forms of craniosynostosis. They also highlight recent
developments in the field of molecular craniosynostosis research with the hope of
identifying targets for medical therapies that might augment the results of
surgical intervention.

MicroRNAs are a class of small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression
post-transcriptionally either by inhibiting protein translation or by causing the
degradation of target mRNAs. Current evidence indicates that miR-33b is involved 
in the regulation of lipid metabolism, cholesterol homeostasis, glucose
metabolism and several human diseases; however, whether miR-33b contributes to
the pathogenesis of human cancers and participates in the regulation of
self-renewal of human cancer stem cells remains unknown. Here, we report the
identification of miR-33b as a negative regulator of cell stemness and metastasis
in breast cancer. Compared with paired normal breast tissues, miR-33b expression 
is downregulated in breast tumor samples and is inversely correlated with lymph
node metastatic status. Ectopic overexpression of miR-33b in highly metastatic
breast cancer cells suppresses cell self-renewal, migration and invasion in vitro
and inhibits lung metastasis in vivo. Conversely, miR-33b knockdown promotes the 
self-renewal, migration and invasion capabilities of noncancerous mammary
epithelial cells. The mechanism through which miR-33b inhibits the stemness,
migration and invasion of breast cancer cells is by targeting HMGA2, SALL4 and
Twist1. These data indicate that miR-33b acts as an onco-suppressive microRNA in 
breast cancer progression by inhibiting the stemness and metastasis of breast
cancer cells.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a vital subpopulation of cells to target for the
treatment of cancers. In oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), there are
several markers such as CD44, ALDH, Pygo2, MAML1, Twist1, Musashi1, Side
population (SP), CD271 and CD90 that have been proposed to identify the cancer
stem cells in individual cancer masses. It has also been demonstrated that stem
cell markers like ALDH1, HIWI, Oct3/4, ABCG2, SOX2, SALL4, BMI-1, NANOG, CD133
and podoplanin are associated with patient's prognosis, pathological stages,
cancer recurrence and therapy resistance. Finding new cancer stem cell targets or
designing drugs to manipulate the known molecular targets in CSCs could be useful
for improvements in clinical outcomes of the disease. To conclude, data suggest
that CSCs in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma are related to resistance to
therapy and poor prognosis of patients with ESCC. Therefore, innovative insights 
into CSC biology and CSC-targeted therapies will help to achieve more effective
management of patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

This study evaluated associations between craniofacial candidate genes and
skeletal variation in patients with malocclusion. Lateral cephalometric
radiographs of 269 untreated adults with skeletal classes I, II, and III
malocclusion were digitized with 14 landmarks. Two-dimensional coordinates were
analyzed using Procrustes fit and principal component (PC) analysis to generate
continuous malocclusion phenotypes. Skeletal class classifications (I, II, or
III) were used as a categorical phenotype. Individuals were genotyped for 198
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 71 craniofacial genes and loci.
Phenotype-genotype associations were tested via multivariate linear regression
for continuous phenotypes and multinomial logistic regression for skeletal
malocclusion class. PC analysis resulted in 4 principal components (PCs)
explaining 69% of the total skeletal facial variation. PC1 explained 32.7% of the
variation and depicted vertical discrepancies ranging from skeletal deep to open 
bites. PC1 was associated with a SNP near PAX5 (P = 0.01). PC2 explained 21.7%
and captured horizontal maxillomandibular discrepancies. PC2 was associated with 
SNPs upstream of SNAI3 (P = 0.0002) and MYO1H (P = 0.006). PC3 explained 8.2% and
captured variation in ramus height, body length, and anterior cranial base
orientation. PC3 was associated with TWIST1 (P = 0.000076). Finally, PC4
explained 6.6% and detected variation in condylar inclination as well as
symphysis projection. PC4 was associated with PAX7 (P = 0.007). Furthermore,
skeletal class II risk increased relative to class I with the minor alleles of
SNPs in FGFR2 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1, P = 0.004) and declined with SNPs in EDN1
(OR = 0.5, P = 0.007). Conversely, skeletal class III risk increased versus class
I with SNPs in FGFR2 (OR 2.2, P = 0.005) and COL1A1 (OR = 2.1, P = 0.008) and
declined with SNPs in TBX5 (OR = 0.5, P = 0.014). PAX5, SNAI3, MYO1H, TWIST1, and
PAX7 are associated with craniofacial skeletal variation among patients with
malocclusion, while FGFR2, EDN1, TBX5, and COL1A1 are associated with type of
skeletal malocclusion.

BACKGROUND: Despite penile carcinoma (PeCa) being a relatively rare neoplasm, it 
remains an important public health issue for poor and developing countries.
Contrary to most tumors, limited data are available for markers that are capable 
of assisting in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of PeCa. We aimed to identify
molecular markers for PeCa by evaluating their epigenomic and transcriptome
profiles and comparing them with surrounding non-malignant tissue (SNT) and
normal glans (NG).
RESULTS: Genome-wide methylation analysis revealed 171 hypermethylated probes in 
PeCa. Transcriptome profiling presented 2,883 underexpressed and 1,378
overexpressed genes. Integrative analysis revealed a panel of 54 genes with an
inverse correlation between methylation and gene expression levels. Distinct
methylome and transcriptome patterns were found for human papillomavirus
(HPV)-positive (38.6%) and negative tumors. Interestingly, grade 3 tumors showed 
a distinct methylation profile when compared to grade 1. In addition, univariate 
analysis revealed that low BDNF methylation was associated with lymph node
metastasis and shorter disease-free survival. CpG hypermethylation and gene
underexpression were confirmed for a panel of genes, including TWIST1, RSOP2,
SOX3, SOX17, PROM1, OTX2, HOXA3, and MEIS1.
CONCLUSIONS: A unique methylome signature was found for PeCa compared to SNT,
with aberrant DNA methylation appearing to modulate the expression of specific
genes. This study describes new pathways with the potential to regulate penile
carcinogenesis, including stem cell regulatory pathways and markers associated to
a worse prognosis. These findings may be instrumental in the discovery and
application of new genetic and epigenetic biomarkers in PeCa.

University, Seoul, Korea.

Metastatic recurrence after cancer treatments with radiation, cancer drugs, or
even immunotherapeutic agents (cytokine, antibody, lymphocyte etc.) is often
intractable and fatal for cancer patients. Therefore, molecular understanding of 
metastatic recurrence is necessary. Recently, these recurrent and metastatic
tumor cells with resistance to cancer drugs have been reported to possess
stem-like attributes and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype.
Previously, we also found that antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte
(CTL)-mediated immunotherapy conferred tumor cells with immune-resistant and
stem-like phenotypes by hyper-activating NANOG/TCL1/AKT signaling axis. In this
study, we report that these immunoedited cells have high metastatic capability
and phenotypes. These cells exhibit enhanced migration, infiltration, and
invasiveness in vitro as well as formation of metastatic lung nodules in vivo.
Moreover, they display EMT-like features characterized by increased expression of
BMI1 and TWIST1. Importantly, these pleiotropic phenotypes of metastasis through 
the expression of the EMT-associated molecules were critically dependent on the
NANOG/TCL1A/AKT signaling axis, which was also conserved across multiple types of
human cancer. Thus, we provide proof of the principle that inhibition of the
NANOG axis is an effective strategy to control metastasis of immunoedited cancer,
particularly, after CTL-based immunotherapy.

Metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 promotes vasculogenic mimicry in gastric 
cancer by upregulating TWIST1/2.

Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is a blood supply modality that is strongly associated 
with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), TWIST1 activation and tumor
progression. We previously reported that metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 
(MACC1) induced the EMT and was associated with a poor prognosis of patients with
gastric cancer (GC), but it remains unknown whether MACC1 promotes VM and
regulates the TWIST signaling pathway in GC. In this study, we investigated MACC1
expression and VM by immunohistochemistry in 88 patients with stage IV GC, and
also investigated the role of TWIST1 and TWIST2 in MACC1-induced VM by using nude
mice with GC xenografts and GC cell lines. We found that the VM density was
significantly increased in the tumors of patients who died of GC and was
positively correlated with MACC1 immunoreactivity (p < 0.05). The 3-year survival
rate was only 8.6% in patients whose tumors showed double positive staining for
MACC1 and VM, whereas it was 41.7% in patients whose tumors were negative for
both MACC1 and VM. Moreover, nuclear expression of MACC1, TWIST1, and TWIST2 was 
upregulated in GC tissues compared with matched adjacent non-tumorous tissues (p 
< 0.05). Overexpression of MACC1 increased TWIST1/2 expression and induced
typical VM in the GC xenografts of nude mice and in GC cell lines. MACC1 enhanced
TWIST1/2 promoter activity and facilitated VM, while silencing of TWIST1 or
TWIST2 inhibited VM. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) increased the nuclear
translocation of MACC1, TWIST1, and TWIST2, while a c-Met inhibitor reduced these
effects. These findings indicate that MACC1 promotes VM in GC by regulating the
HGF/c-Met-TWIST1/2 signaling pathway, which means that MACC1 and this pathway are
potential new therapeutic targets for GC.

Matrix stiffness potently regulates cellular behaviour in various biological
contexts. In breast tumours, the presence of dense clusters of collagen fibrils
indicates increased matrix stiffness and correlates with poor survival. It is
unclear how mechanical inputs are transduced into transcriptional outputs to
drive tumour progression. Here we report that TWIST1 is an essential
mechanomediator that promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in response
to increasing matrix stiffness. High matrix stiffness promotes nuclear
translocation of TWIST1 by releasing TWIST1 from its cytoplasmic binding partner 
G3BP2. Loss of G3BP2 leads to constitutive TWIST1 nuclear localization and
synergizes with increasing matrix stiffness to induce EMT and promote tumour
invasion and metastasis. In human breast tumours, collagen fibre alignment, a
marker of increasing matrix stiffness, and reduced expression of G3BP2 together
predict poor survival. Our findings reveal a TWIST1-G3BP2 mechanotransduction
pathway that responds to biomechanical signals from the tumour microenvironment
to drive EMT, invasion and metastasis.

Ephrin reverse signaling mediates palatal fusion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition independently of Tgfß3.

The mammalian secondary palate forms from shelves of epithelia-covered mesenchyme
that meet at midline and fuse. The midline epithelial seam (MES) is thought to
degrade by apoptosis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), or both.
Failure to degrade the MES blocks fusion and causes cleft palate. It was
previously thought that transforming growth factor ß3 (Tgfß3) is required to
initiate fusion. Members of the Eph tyrosine kinase receptor family and their
membrane-bound ephrin ligands are expressed on the MES. We demonstrated that
treatment of mouse palates with recombinant EphB2/Fc to activate ephrin reverse
signaling (where the ephrin acts as a receptor and transduces signals from its
cytodomain) was sufficient to cause mouse palatal fusion when Tgfß3 signaling was
blocked by an antibody against Tgfß3 or by an inhibitor of the TgfßrI
serine/threonine receptor kinase. Cultured palatal epithelial cells traded their 
expression of epithelial cell markers for that of mesenchymal cells and became
motile after treatment with EphB2/Fc. They concurrently increased their
expression of the EMT-associated transcription factors Snail, Sip1, and Twist1.
EphB2/Fc did not cause apoptosis in these cells. These data reveal that ephrin
reverse signaling directs palatal fusion in mammals through a mechanism that
involves EMT but not apoptosis and activates a gene expression program not
previously associated with ephrin reverse signaling.

Twist1 is a transcription factor driving epithelial-mesenchymal transition,
invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells. Mice with germ-line Twist1
knockout are embryonic lethal, while adult mice with inducible Twist1 knockout
have no obvious health problems, suggesting that Twist1 is a viable therapeutic
target for the inhibition of invasion and metastasis of breast cancer in adult
patients. In this study, we expressed a luciferase protein or a Twist1-luciferase
fusion protein in HeLa cells as part of a high throughput system to screen 1280
compounds in the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC) from
Sigma-Aldrich for their effects on Twist1 protein expression. One of the most
interesting compounds identified is tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor (ER)
modulator used to treat ER-positive breast cancer. Tamoxifen treatment
significantly accelerated Twist1 degradation in multiple cell lines including
HEK293 human kidney cells, 4T1 and 168FARN mouse mammary tumor cells with either 
ectopically or endogenously expressed Twist1. Tamoxifen-induced Twist1
degradation could be blocked by the MG132 proteasome inhibitor, suggesting that
tamoxifen induces Twist1 degradation through the ubiquitination-proteasome
pathway. However, tamoxifen-induced Twist1 degradation was independent of Twist1 
mRNA expression, estrogen signaling and MAPK-mediated Twist1 phosphorylation in
these cells. Importantly, tamoxifen also significantly inhibited invasive
behavior in Matrigel and lung metastasis in SCID-bg mice of ER-negative 4T1
mammary tumor cells, which depend on endogenous Twist1 to invade and metastasize.
These results indicate that tamoxifen can significantly accelerate Twist1
degradation to suppress cancer cell invasion and metastasis, suggesting that
tamoxifen can be used not only to treat ER-positive breast cancers but also to
reduce Twist1-mediated invasion and metastasis in ER-negative breast cancers.

Elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem
cell (hMSC) is important for the development of cell therapies for bone loss and 
regeneration. Here we showed that hsa-miR-199a-5p modulated osteogenic
differentiation of hMSCs at both early and late stages through HIF1a pathway.
hsa-miR-199a expression was up-regulated during osteogenesis for both of two
mature forms, miR-199a-5p and -3p. Over-expression of miR-199a-5p but not -3p
enhanced differentiation of hMSCs in vitro, whereas inhibition of miR-199a-5p
reduced the expression of osteoblast-specific genes, alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
activity, and mineralization. Furthermore, over-expression of miR-199a enhanced
ectopic bone formation in vivo. Chitosan nanoparticles were used for delivery of 
stable modified hsa-miR-199a-5p (agomir) both in vitro and in vivo, as a
proof-of-concept for stable agomir delivery on bone regeneration. The
hsa-mir199a-5p agomir were mixed with Chitosan nanoparticles to form
nanoparticle/hsa-mir199a-5p agomir plasmid (nanoparticle/agomir) complexes, and
nanoparticle/agomir complexes could improve the in vivo regeneration of bone.
Further mechanism studies revealed that hypoxia enhanced osteogenesis at early
stage and inhibited osteogenesis maturation at late stage through HIF1a-Twist1
pathway. At early stage of differentiation, hypoxia induced HIF1a-Twist1 pathway 
to enhance osteogenesis by up-regulating miR-199a-5p, while at late stage of
differentiation, miR-199a-5p enhanced osteogenesis maturation by inhibiting
HIF1a-Twist1 pathway.

Malignant melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer, has a high propensity
for metastatic spread and is notoriously chemotherapy-resistant. Cordycepin, the 
active component of Cordyceps spp., has been identified to have anti-metastatic
effect on tumor progression and thus possesses pharmacological and therapeutic
potentials. However, the mechanisms of anti-metastatic effects of cordycepin at
cellular levels remain elusive. We analyzed the effect of cordycepin on human
melanoma miRNA expression profiles by miRNAarray and found that miR-33b was
upregulated in highly-metastatic melanoma cell lines following cordycepin
exposure. Cordycepin-mediated miR-33b expression was dependent on LXR-RXR
heterodimer activation. miR-33b directly binds to HMGA2, Twist1 and ZEB1 3'-UTR
to suppress their expression. The negative correlations between miR-33b levels
and HMGA2, Twist1 or ZEB1 expression were detected in 72 patient melanoma tissue 
samples. By targeting HMGA2 and Twist1, miR-33b attenuated melanoma migration and
invasiveness upon cordycepin exposure. miR-33b knockdown or ZEB1 overexpression
reverted cordycepin-mediated mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), triggering 
the expression of N-cadherin. In spontaneous metastasis models, cordycepin
suppressed tumor metastasis without altering primary tumor growth. We showed for 
the first time that targeting miRNA by cordycepin indicates a new mechanism of
cordycepin-induced suppression of tumor metastasis and miR-33b/HMGA2/Twist1/ZEB1 
axis plays critical roles in regulating melanoma dissemination.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has an established role in promoting
tumor progression and the acquisition of therapeutic resistance. Here, the EMT
phenotype was detected in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer tissues and cell
lines, and correlated with decreased miR-186 expression, increased Twist1
expression, chemoresistance and poor prognosis in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC)
patients. Introducing miR-186 into EOC cells led to a reduction in twist family
bHLH transcription factor 1 (Twist1) expression along with morphological,
functional and molecular changes consistent with mesenchymal-to-epithelial
transition, G1 cell-cycle arrest and enhanced cell apoptosis, which consequently 
rendered the cells more sensitive to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore,
luciferase reporter and rescue assay results showed that the EMT and drug
resistance reversal in response to miR-186 was mediated by Twist1. Collectively, 
these findings implicate miR-186 as an attractive candidate for overcoming
chemoresistance in ovarian cancer therapy.

BACKGROUND: Intestinal remodeling during amphibian metamorphosis has long been
studied as a model for the formation of the adult organs in vertebrates,
especially the formation of adult organ-specific stem cells. Like all other
processes during metamorphosis, this process is controlled by thyroid hormone
(T3), which affects cell fate and behavior through transcriptional regulation of 
target genes by binding to T3 receptors (TRs). Earlier studies have shown that
Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is induced by T3 in the developing adult stem cells and that
the Shh receptor and other downstream components are present in the connective
tissue and at lower levels in the muscles at the climax of intestinal remodeling.
However, no in vivo studies have carried out to investigate whether Shh produced 
in the adult cells can regulate the connective tissue to promote intestinal
maturation.
RESULTS: We have addressed this issue by treating tadpoles with Shh inhibitor
cyclopamine. We showed that cyclopamine but not the structurally related chemical
tomatidine inhibited the expression of Shh response genes BMP4, Snai2, and
Twist1. More importantly, we showed that cyclopamine reduced the cell
proliferation of both the developing adult stem cells as well as cells in the
other intestinal tissues at the climax of metamorphosis, leading to
delayed/incomplete remodeling of the intestine at the end of metamorphosis. We
further revealed that both Snai2 and Twist1 were strongly upregulated during
metamorphosis in the intestine and their expression was restricted to the
connective tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Shh indeed signals the connective tissue
whereby it can increase adult stem cell proliferation and promote formation of
the adult intestine.

Inhibition of iNOS as a novel effective targeted therapy against triple-negative 
breast cancer.

Rodriguez AA, Cusimano J, Weiss HL, Zhao H, Landis MD, Dave B, Gross SS, Chang
JC.

INTRODUCTION: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive form of
breast cancer with no effective targeted therapy. Inducible nitric oxide synthase
(iNOS) is associated with poor survival in patients with breast cancer by
increasing tumor aggressiveness. This work aimed to investigate the potential of 
iNOS inhibitors as a targeted therapy for TNBC. We hypothesized that inhibition
of endogenous iNOS would decrease TNBC aggressiveness by reducing tumor
initiation and metastasis through modulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT)-inducing factors.
METHODS: iNOS protein levels were determined in 83 human TNBC tissues and
correlated with clinical outcome. Proliferation, mammosphere-forming efficiency, 
migration, and EMT transcription factors were assessed in vitro after iNOS
inhibition. Endogenous iNOS targeting was evaluated as a potential therapy in
TNBC mouse models.
RESULTS: High endogenous iNOS expression was associated with worse prognosis in
patients with TNBC by gene expression as well as immunohistochemical analysis.
Selective iNOS (1400 W) and pan-NOS (L-NMMA and L-NAME) inhibitors diminished
cell proliferation, cancer stem cell self-renewal, and cell migration in vitro,
together with inhibition of EMT transcription factors (Snail, Slug, Twist1, and
Zeb1). Impairment of hypoxia-inducible factor 1a, endoplasmic reticulum stress
(IRE1a/XBP1), and the crosstalk between activating transcription factor
3/activating transcription factor 4 and transforming growth factor ß was
observed. iNOS inhibition significantly reduced tumor growth, the number of lung 
metastases, tumor initiation, and self-renewal.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the effectiveness of L-NMMA in decreasing tumor growth
and enhancing survival rate in TNBC, we propose a targeted therapeutic clinical
trial by re-purposing the pan-NOS inhibitor L-NMMA, which has been extensively
investigated for cardiogenic shock as an anti-cancer therapeutic.

FOXF2 deficiency promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis of
basal-like breast cancer.

Wang QS, Kong PZ, Li XQ, Yang F, Feng YM.

INTRODUCTION: Our previous clinical study demonstrated that the under-expression 
of FOXF2 is associated with early-onset metastasis and poor prognosis of patients
with triple-negative breast cancer. In this study, we further characterized the
role of FOXF2 in metastasis of basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) and underlying
molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: RT-qPCR, immunoblot, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry were
performed to assess the expression of genes and proteins in cell lines and
tissues. A series of in vitro and in vivo assays was performed in the cells with 
RNAi-mediated knockdown or overexpression to elucidate the function and
transcriptional regulatory role of FOXF2 in breast cancer.
RESULTS: We found that FOXF2 was specifically expressed in most basal-like breast
cells. FOXF2 deficiency enhanced the metastatic ability of BLBC cells in vitro
and in vivo. Additionally, FOXF2 deficiency induced the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) of basal-like breast cells. Furthermore, we identified that
TWIST1 is a transcriptional target of FOXF2. TWIST1 was negatively regulated by
FOXF2 and mediated the FOXF2-regulated EMT phenotype of basal-like breast cells
and aggressive property of BLBC.
CONCLUSIONS: FOXF2 is a novel EMT-suppressing transcription factor in BLBC. FOXF2
deficiency enhances metastatic ability of BLBC cells by activating the EMT
program through upregulating the transcription of TWIST1.

Protein arginine methyl transferase 1 (PRMT1) was shown to be up-regulated in
cancers and important for cancer cell proliferation. However, the role of PRMT1
in lung cancer progression and metastasis remains incompletely understood. In the
present study, we show that PRMT1 is an important regulator of
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer cell migration, and invasion,
which are essential processes during cancer progression, and metastasis.
Additionally, we have identified Twist1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription
factor and a well-known E-cadherin repressor, as a novel PRMT1 substrate. Taken
together, we show that PRMT1 is a novel regulator of EMT and arginine 34 (Arg-34)
methylation of Twist1 as a unique "methyl arginine mark" for active E-cadherin
repression. Therefore, targeting PRMT1-mediated Twist1 methylation might
represent a novel strategy for developing new anti-invasive/anti-metastatic
drugs. Moreover, methylated Twist1 (Arg-34), as such, could also emerge as a
potential important biomarker for lung cancer.

Patients with highly malignant glioblastomas have a short median survival time
mainly due to aggressive relapses after therapeutic treatment. Beside others,
they achieve their progressive character via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT). However, comprehensive investigations on EMT in paired primary-recurrent
glioblastoma pairs are presently not available. Thus, in our present study we
examined the expression profile of different EMT-markers in 17 matched primary
and recurrent glioblastomas by qPCR and double-immunofluorescence stainings to
identify EMT marker expressing cell types. Additionally, we analyzed the
influence of temozolomide on EMT marker expression in vitro. In comparison to
primary tumors, expression of ß-catenin (p<0.05), Snail1 (p<0.05), Snail2/Slug
(p<0.05), biglycan (p<0.05) and Twist1 (p<0.01) was downregulated in recurrence
whereas L1CAM showed upregulation (p<0.05; qPCR). Expression of desmoplakin,
vimentin, fibronectin and TGF-ß1 with its receptors TGF-ßR1 and TGF-ßR2 was
almost unchanged. Comparing each individual pair, five different 'EMT groups'
within our glioblastoma collective were identified according to the regulation of
mRNA expression of GFAP, desmoplakin, Snail1, Snail2, Twist1 and vimentin.
Additionally, double-stainings of EMT markers in combination with cell specific
markers (glial fibrillary acidic protein, CD11b, von Willebrand factor) revealed 
that EMT markers were expressed in a complex pattern with all three cellular
types as possible sources. Temozolomide treatment significantly induced mRNA
expression of nearly all investigated EMT markers in T98G glioma cells. Thus, EMT
seems to be involved in glioma progression in a complex way requiring an
individualized analysis, and is influenced by commonly used therapeutic options
in glioma therapy.

The development of breast cancer is linked to the loss of estrogen receptor (ER) 
during the course of tumor progression, resulting in loss of responsiveness to
hormonal treatment. The mechanisms underlying dynamic ERa gene expression change 
in breast cancer remain unclear. A range of physiological and biological changes,
including increased adipose tissue hypoxia, accompanies obesity. Hypoxia in
adipocytes can establish a pro-malignancy environment in breast tissues.
Epidemiological studies have linked obesity with basal-like breast cancer risk
and poor disease outcome, suggesting that obesity may affect the tumor phenotype 
by skewing the microenvironment toward support of more aggressive tumor
phenotypes. In the present study, human SGBS adipocytes were co-cultured with
ER-positive MCF7 cells for 24 h. After co-culture, HIF1a, TGF-ß, and lectin-type 
oxidized LDL receptor 1 (LOX1) mRNA levels in the SGBS cells were increased.
Expression levels of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-inducing
transcription factors FOXC2 and TWIST1 were increased in the co-cultured MCF7
cells. In addition, the E-cadherin mRNA level was decreased, while the N-cadherin
mRNA level was increased in the co-cultured MCF7 cells. ERa mRNA levels were
significantly repressed in the co-cultured MCF7 cells. ERa gene expression in the
MCF7 cells was decreased due to increased HIF1a in the SGBS cells. These results 
suggest that adipocytes can modify breast cancer cell ER gene expression through 
hypoxia and also can promote EMT processes in breast cancer cells, supporting an 
important role of obesity in aggressive breast cancer development.

Référence National Dysostoses Crâniofaciales, Hôpital Necker, Paris, France.

BACKGROUND: New forms and varieties of craniosynostoses are continuously
identified due to the current increased interest of clinicians and genetists
especially since the introduction of microarray-based comparative genomic
hybridization (Array-CGH) techniques in the diagnostic setting of patients with
craniofacial anomalies.
METHODS: In this report, we describe the case of an infant who associated the
early fusion of the metopic and both the coronal sutures. The interaction of the 
early fusion of the anterior group of the main cranial sutures gave the infant a 
particular clinical phenotypes with a Y configuration of the frontal bone and a
globally reduced size of the skull. Such a deformity was observed in utero and
was subsequently confirmed by the postnatal imaging of the head.
RESULTS: This phenotype was never described previously in antenatal period to our
knowledge. The array-CGH showed a heterozygous 9.0 Mb deletion in the chromosomal
region 7p21.1p21.3 encompassing approximately 25 other genes, spanning from
THSD7A to TWIST1/FERD3L.
CONCLUSION: This case further illustrates the variability of the clinical
spectrum of craniofacial disorders associated with TWIST1 abnormalities. It is
important to note that the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome caused by microdeletion is
generally characterized by a mental disability. However, of interest, the
postoperative psychomotor development of the child considered hereby was within
the normal limits.

The Sézary Syndrome (SS) is an aggressive CD4+ leukemic variant of cutaneous
T-cell lymphoma. Epigenetic modification of cancer cell genome is often linked to
the expression of important cancer-related genes. Here we addressed the
hypothesis that, in SS, DNA hypomethylation is involved in upregulation of PLS3, 
GATA6, and TWIST1, genes that are undetected in normal lymphocytes.
Pyrosequencing analysis of CpG rich regions, and CpG dinucleotides within the 5' 
regulatory regions, confirmed hypomethylation of all three genes in SS, compared 
with controls. We then studied how methylation regulates PLS3 transcription in
vitro using PLS3-negative (Jurkat) and PLS3-positive (HT-1080) cell lines.
Treatment with the hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine induced PLS3 expression in
Jurkat cells and in vitro methylation of the cloned PLS3 promoter suppressed
luciferase expression in HT-1080 cells. In conclusion, we show that promoter
hypomethylation is associated with PLS3, GATA6, and TWIST1 overexpression in SS
CD4+ T cells and that methylation can regulate PLS3 expression in vitro. The
mechanisms of DNA hypomethylation in vivo and the functional role of PLS3,
TWIST1, and GATA6 in SS are being investigated.

Bone tissue undergoes constant turnover supported by stem cells. Recent studies
showed that perivascular mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) contribute to the turnover
of long bones. Craniofacial bones are flat bones derived from a different
embryonic origin than the long bones. The identity and regulating niche for
craniofacial-bone MSCs remain unknown. Here, we identify Gli1+ cells within the
suture mesenchyme as the main MSC population for craniofacial bones. They are not
associated with vasculature, give rise to all craniofacial bones in the adult and
are activated during injury repair. Gli1+ cells are typical MSCs in vitro.
Ablation of Gli1+ cells leads to craniosynostosis and arrest of skull growth,
indicating that these cells are an indispensable stem cell population.
Twist1(+/-) mice with craniosynostosis show reduced Gli1+ MSCs in sutures,
suggesting that craniosynostosis may result from diminished suture stem cells.
Our study indicates that craniofacial sutures provide a unique niche for MSCs for
craniofacial bone homeostasis and repair.

Anti-metastatic action of anacardic acid targets VEGF-induced signalling pathways
in epithelial to mesenchymal transition.

Anacardic acid is a major constituent of nutshell of cashew. In this study, we
have isolated it from the leaves of Anacardium Occidentale L. using
polarity-based fractionation and confirmed the structure using GC-MS, NMR and
FT-IR. The main focus of this study is to harness the molecular mechanism of
anti-metastatic action of anacardic acid (A1). We have used MCF-7, a weak
metastatic and U-87, a highly metastatic, breast and glioma cell lines
respectively, for our study. We have shown that VEGF increases migration and
invasion activities of MCF-7 cells, upon overexpression of Twist and Snail genes.
It is observed from the current study that exposure of MCF-7 cells to A1 resulted
in upregulation of epithelial marker E-cadherin with a concomitant decrease in
the expression of mesenchymal markers Twist and Snail gene expression besides
exhibiting a strong anti-migratory and anti-invasive activity. In metastatic U-87
glioma cells, treatment with A1 decreased the phosphorylation of MAP kinases,
inhibited the translocation of Sp1 and down regulated VEGF and Flt-1 gene
expression. Overall, the current findings demonstrate for the first time that
anacardic acid functions as a potent EMT inhibitor by targeting VEGF signaling
pathway, providing a novel template for drug discovery.

We know little concerning the expression of transforming growth factor-ß1
(TGF-ß1) and TGF-ß1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in
gastric mucosa and their changes after eradication of Helicobacter pylori
infection have not yet been clarified. In the present study, we compared the time
course of messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of TGF-ß1 and five EMT markers (Twist, 
Snail, Slug, vimentin and E-cadherin) in 111 controls, 55 patients with gastric
dysplasia and 71 patients with early gastric cancer, following eradication of
H.pylori. mRNA levels in non-cancerous gastric mucosa were measured using
quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction and the histologic findings of
gastric mucosa were compared before and after eradication. The average duration
of follow-up was 46.7 months (6.0-112.4). The levels of TGF-ß1, Twist, Snail,
Slug and vimentin mRNA, in addition to levels of CD44 detected by
immunohistochemistry, showed all up-regulation in patients with dysplasia or
early gastric cancer compared with controls (P < 0.05); moreover, the mRNA levels
of E-cadherin, an epithelial marker, were decreased in these patients compared
with the control group (P < 0.001). Eradication of H.pylori reduced the
expression of TGF-ß1, Twist, Snail, Slug and vimentin mRNA (P-value for slope
<0.001), as well as the immunohistochemical expression of CD44 (P = 0.014),
whereas it enhanced the expression of E-cadherin (P-value for slope < 0.05).
Thus, H.pylori infection may trigger the TGF-ß1-induced EMT pathway and the
emergence of gastric cancer stem cells (CSCs). Its eradication may prevent the
carcinogenesis of gastric cancer by inhibiting these two pathways.

AIM: To study the role of Twist gene in gastric cancer by gene silencing,
including the potential of induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and
proliferation inhibition in human malignant gastric SGC7901 cells.
METHODS: The expression level of Twist in gastric cancer samples was measured by 
immunohistochemistry. The effects of Twist gene silencing were detected at both
mRNA and protein levels by RT-PCR and Western blot. We also evaluated the cell
proliferation and apoptosis by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. We determined the 
activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9 with a caspase activity assay kit. Cell cycle
distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell migration and invasion ability 
was evaluated by wound scratch assay and Boyden chamber assay.
RESULTS: Twist protein was highly expressed in gastric cancer samples. Twist gene
silencing significantly induced apoptosis, cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase,
proliferation inhibition, and reduced the ability of migration and invasion in
human gastric cancer SGC7901 cells. Meanwhile, both caspase-3 and caspase-9 were 
activated.
CONCLUSION: The Twist gene could serve as a potential molecular target for gene
therapy of gastric cancer with targeted small interfering RNA.

Tumor metastasis involves circulating and tumor-initiating capacities of
metastatic cancer cells. Hepatic TM4SF5 promotes EMT for malignant growth and
migration. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) biomarkers remain unexplored for
metastatic potential throughout metastasis. Here, novel TM4SF5/CD44
interaction-mediated self-renewal and circulating tumor cell (CTC) capacities
were mechanistically explored. TM4SF5-dependent sphere growth was correlated with
CD133+, CD24-, ALDH activity, and a physical association between CD44 and TM4SF5.
The TM4SF5/CD44 interaction activated c-Src/STAT3/Twist1/B mi1 signaling for
spheroid formation, while disturbing the interaction, expression, or activity of 
any component in this signaling pathway inhibited spheroid formation. In serial
xenografts of less than 5,000 cells/injection, TM4SF5-positive tumors exhibited
locally-increased CD44 expression, suggesting tumor cell differentiation.
TM4SF5-positive cells were identified circulating in blood 4 to 6 weeks after
orthotopic liver- injection. Anti-TM4SF reagents blocked their metastasis to
distal intestinal organs. Altogether, our results provide evidence that TM4SF5
promotes self-renewal and CTC properties supported by
CD133+/TM4SF5+/CD44+(TM4SF5-bound)/ALDH+/CD24-markers during HCC metastasis.

Emerging evidence demonstrates that platelet-derived growth factor-D (PDGF-D)
plays a critical role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and drug
resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. However, the underlying
mechanism has not been fully elucidated. The objective is to explore the
molecular mechanism of PDGF-D-mediated EMT in drug resistance HCC cells. To
achieve our goal, we used multiple approaches including Western blotting,
real-time RT-PCR, wound healing assay, invasion assay, luciferase activity assay,
transfection, and immunohistochemistry. We found that PDGF-D is highly expressed 
in gemcitabine-resistant (GR) HCC cells. Moreover, PDGF-D markedly inhibited
miR-106a expression and subsequently upregulated Twist1 expression. Notably,
PDGF-D expression was associated with miR-106a and Twist1 in HCC patients. Our
findings provide a possible molecular mechanism for understanding GR
chemoresistance in HCC cells. Therefore, inactivation of PDGF-D/Twist or
activation of miR-106a could be a novel strategy for the treatment of HCC.

Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in the
United States, and survival rates are lower for patients with metastases and/or
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC; ER, PR, and Her2 negative). Understanding
the mechanisms of cancer metastasis is therefore crucial to identify new
therapeutic targets and develop novel treatments to improve patient outcomes. A
potential target is the TWIST1 transcription factor, which is often overexpressed
in aggressive breast cancers and is a master regulator of cellular migration
through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, we demonstrate an
siRNA-based TWIST1 silencing approach with delivery using a modified
poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer. Our results demonstrate that SUM1315 TNBC
cells efficiently take up PAMAM-siRNA complexes, leading to significant knockdown
of TWIST1 and EMT-related target genes. Knockdown lasts up to one week after
transfection and leads to a reduction in migration and invasion, as determined by
wound healing and transwell assays. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PAMAM
dendrimers can deliver siRNA to xenograft orthotopic tumors and siRNA remains in 
the tumor for at least four hours after treatment. These results suggest that
further development of dendrimer-based delivery of siRNA for TWIST1 silencing may
lead to a valuable adjunctive therapy for patients with TNBC.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Twist gene deficiency on the enrichment
and migration of breast cancer stem-like cells (CSCs).
METHODS: Twist gene in the BT-549 cell line was knocked down by shRNA
interference technology, and the cell line BT-549-shVec was used as the negative 
control group. Interference efficiency was determined by real-time quantitative
RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. Mammospheres with the characteristics of
stem-like cells were collected by long-term serum-free suspension cultivation.
The migration ability of mammospheres was analyzed by Transwell(TM) assay.
RESULTS: The BT-549-shTwist breast cancer cells were successfully established by 
shRNA interference technology. The enrichment and migration abilities of CSCs
from the BT-549-shTwist cell line decreased significantly.
CONCLUSION: Twist gene promotes the enrichment and migration of CSCs from the
BT-549 cell line.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) confers stem cell-like phenotype and
more motile properties to carcinoma cells. During EMT, the expression of
E-cadherin decreases, resulting in loss of cell-cell adhesion and increased
migration. Expression of Twist1 and other pleiotropic transcription factors, such
as Snail, is known to activate EMT. We established primary colon cancer cell
cultures from samples of operated patients and validated cultures by cytogenetic 
and molecular biology approaches. Western blot assay, quantitative real-time PCR 
and immunofluorescence were performed to investigate the expression of
E-cadherin, vimentin, ß-catenin, cytokeratin-20 and -18, Twist1, Snail, CD44,
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), Sox2, Oct4 and Nanog. Moreover, cell differentiation was
induced by incubation with LiCl-containing medium for 10 days. We observed that
these primary colorectal cancer (CRC) cells lost expression of the E-cadherin
epithelial marker, which was instead expressed in cancer and normal colon mucosa 
of the same patient, while overexpressed vimentin (mesenchymal marker), Twist1,
Snail (EMT markers) and COX2. Cytokeratin-18 was expressed both in tissues and
cell cultures. Expression of stem cell markers, such as CD44, Oct4 and Nanog,
were also observed. Following differentiation with the glycogen synthase kinase
3ß (GSK3ß) inhibitor LiCl, the cells began to express E-cadherin and, at once,
Twist1 and Snail expression was strongly downregulated, suggesting a
MET-reverting process. In conclusion, we established primary colon mesenchymal
cancer cell cultures expressing mesenchymal and epithelial biomarkers together
with high level of EMT transcription factors. We propose that they could
represent a good model for studying EMT and its reverting mechanism, the
mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Our observation indicates that LiCl, 
a GSK3ß inhibitor, induces MET in vitro, suggesting that LiCl and GSK3ß could
represent, respectively, interesting drug, and target for CRC therapy.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of MSX2 interference on
epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) of pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1.
METHODS: Three vectors containing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) of MSX2 (shMSX2-1, 
shMSX2-2, and shMSX2-3) and the empty vector (negative control) were transfected 
separately into PANC-1 cell line with Lipofectamine2000. Real-time RT-PCR and
Western blotting were used to observe changes in the expressions of MSX2,
E-cadherin, and vimentin in the cells. CCK-8 assay was used to assess the changes
in the cell growth, and wound scratch assay and Transwell assay were employed to 
evaluate the cell invasion and metastasis after the transfection.
RESULTS: Among the 3 shRNA, shMSX2-1 showed the highest interference efficiency. 
MSX2 knockdown by the specific shRNA of MSX2 significantly increased E-cadherin
expressions, lowered vimentin expressions, and suppressed the invasion,
metastasis and proliferation of the cells (P<0.05). MSX2 knockdown also resulted 
in morphological changes of the cells into cobblestone-like cells in close
contact. RT-PCR results revealed significantly reduced mRNA expressions of the
transcription factors snail and twist (P<0.05) without affecting slug and zeb1
expressions in the cells with MSX2 knockdown. Conclusion MSX2 knockdown can
reverse EMT and induce MET in PANC1 cells, in which process the transcription
factors snail and twist may play a role.

Multiplexed fluorescent hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and advanced imaging
techniques can be used to evaluate combinatorial gene expression patterns in
whole mouse embryos with unprecedented spatial resolution. Using HCR, DNA probes 
complementary to mRNA targets trigger chain reactions in which metastable
fluorophore-labeled DNA HCR hairpins self-assemble into tethered fluorescent
amplification polymers. Each target mRNA is detected by a probe set containing
one or more DNA probes, with each probe carrying two HCR initiators. For
multiplexed experiments, probe sets for different target mRNAs carry orthogonal
initiators that trigger orthogonal DNA HCR amplification cascades labeled by
spectrally distinct fluorophores. As a result, in situ amplification is performed
for all targets simultaneously, and the duration of the experiment is independent
of the number of target mRNAs. We have used multiplexed fluorescent in situ HCR
and advanced imaging technologies to address questions of cell heterogeneity and 
tissue complexity in craniofacial patterning and anterior neural development. In 
the sample protocol presented here, we detect three different mRNA targets:
Tg(egfp), encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene
(typically used as a control); Twist1, encoding a transcription factor involved
in cell lineage determination and differentiation; and Pax2, encoding a
transcription factor expressed in the mid-hindbrain region of the mouse embryo.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a dynamic process that relies on
cellular plasticity. Recently, the process of an oncogenic EMT, followed by a
reverse mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), has been implicated as
critical in the metastatic colonization of carcinomas. Unlike governance of
epithelial programming, regulation of mesenchymal programming is not well
understood in EMT. Here, we describe and characterize the first microRNA that
enhances exclusively mesenchymal programming. We demonstrate that miR-424 is
upregulated early during a TWIST1 or SNAI1-induced EMT, and that it causes cells 
to express mesenchymal genes without affecting epithelial genes, resulting in a
mixed/intermediate EMT. Furthermore, miR-424 increases motility, decreases
adhesion, and induces a growth arrest, changes associated with a complete EMT
that can be reversed when miR-424 expression is lowered, concomitant with an
MET-like process. Breast cancer patient miR-424 levels positively associate with 
TWIST1/2 and EMT-like gene signatures, and miR-424 is increased in primary tumors
versus matched normal breast. However, miR-424 is downregulated in patient
metastases versus matched primary tumors. Correspondingly, miR-424 decreases
tumor initiation and is posttranscriptionally downregulated in macrometastases in
mice, suggesting the need for biphasic expression of miR-424 to transit the
EMT-MET axis. Next-generation RNA sequencing revealed miR-424 regulates numerous 
EMT and cancer stemness-associated genes, including TGFBR3, whose downregulation 
promotes mesenchymal phenotypes, but not tumor-initiating phenotypes. Instead, we
demonstrate that increased MAPK-ERK signaling is critical for miR-424-mediated
decreases in tumor-initiating phenotypes. These findings suggest miR-424 plays
distinct roles in tumor progression, potentially facilitating earlier, but
repressing later, stages of metastasis by regulating an EMT-MET axis.

Metastasis is the main reason for high recurrence and poor survival of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative resection. However, the molecular
mechanism underlying HCC metastasis remains unclear. Here, we report on a novel
function of SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 12 (Sox12), a member of the
SYR-related high mobility group box family proteins, in promoting HCC metastasis.
Overexpression of Sox12 was significantly correlated with loss of tumor
encapsulation, microvascular invasion, and a higher tumor-nodule-metastasis (TNM)
stage and indicated poor prognosis in human HCC patients. Sox12 expression was an
independent and significant risk factor for recurrence and reduced survival after
curative resection. Overexpression of Sox12 induced epithelial-mesenchymal
transition by transactivating Twist1 expression. Down-regulation of Twist1
decreased Sox12-enhanced HCC migration, invasion, and metastasis, whereas
up-regulation of Twist1 rescued the decreased migration, invasion, and metastasis
induced by Sox12 knockdown. Additionally, serial deletion, site-directed
mutagenesis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that fibroblast
growth factor binding protein 1 (FGFBP1) was a direct transcriptional target of
Sox12. Knockdown of FGFBP1 decreased Sox12-mediated HCC invasion and metastasis, 
whereas overexpression of FGFBP1 rescued the decreased invasion and metastasis
induced by Sox12 knockdown. Furthermore, forkhead box Q1 (FoxQ1) directly bound
to the Sox12 promoter and transactivated its expression, which contributed to
Sox12 overexpression in human HCC. Knockdown of Sox12 dramatically decreased
FoxQ1-mediated HCC metastasis. In two independent cohorts of human HCC tissues,
Sox12 expression was positively correlated with Twist1, FGFBP1, and FoxQ1
expression, and patients with positive coexpression of Sox12/Twist1,
Sox12/FGFBP1, or FoxQ1/Sox12 were associated with poorer prognosis.CONCLUSION:
Up-regulated Sox12 induced by FoxQ1 promotes HCC invasion and metastasis by
transactivating Twist1 and FGFBP1 expression. Thus, our study implicates Sox12 as
a potential prognostic biomarker and a novel therapeutic target for HCC.

Comparison analysis in synchronous and metachronous metastatic colorectal cancer 
based on microarray expression profile.

Wang DD, Xu Y, Tu YL, Tan XL, Zhu ZM, Han MM, Dou CQ, Zeng JP, Tan JW, Du JD,
Jiao HB, Cai SW.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies, 
and liver metastasis is one of the major causes of death of CRC. This study aimed
to compare the genetic difference between metachronous lesions (MC) and
synchronous lesions (SC) and explore the molecular pathology of CRC metastasis.
METHODOLOGY: Microarray expression profile data (GSE10961) including 8 MC and 10 
SC was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus. The differentially expressed
genes (DEGs) between the two groups were identified based on T test. Furthermore,
GO enrichment analysis was performed for the down-regulated DEGs using DAVID.
Finally, Classify validation of known CRC genes based on previous studies between
MC and SC samples was conducted.
RESULTS: Total of 36 DEGs including 35 down-regulated DEGs and 1 up-regulated
DEGs were identified. The expressional differences of the 5 informative
oncogenes: EGFr, PIK3R1, PTGS2 (COX-2), PTGS1 (COX1), and ALOX5AP between SC and 
MC were really tiny.
CONCLUSIONS: Some DEGs, such as NFAT5, OLR1, ERAP2, HOXC6 and TWIST1 might play
crucial roles in the regulation of CRC metastasis (both SC and MC) and by
disrupting some pathways. However, our results indeed demand further research and
experiment.

We report on two patients with an unusual combination of achondroplasia and
surgically treated sagittal synostosis and scaphocephaly. The most common
achondroplasia mutation, p.Gly380Arg in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3
(FGFR3), was detected in both patients. Molecular genetic testing of FGFR1,
FGFR2, FGFR3 and TWIST1 genes failed to detect any additional mutations. There
are several reports of achondroplasia with associated craniosynostosis, but no
other cases of scaphocephaly in children with achondroplasia have been described.
Recently it has been demonstrated that FGFR3 mutations affect not only
endochondral ossification but also membranous ossification, providing new
explanations for the craniofacial hallmarks in achondroplasia. Our report
suggests that the association of isolated scaphocephaly and other
craniosynostoses with achondroplasia may be under recognized.

Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) refers to the unique ability of highly aggressive tumor
cells to mimic the pattern of embryonic vasculogenesis, which was associated with
invasion and metastasis. The grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPs) had attracted
much attention as a potential bioactive anti-carcinogenic agent. However, GSPs
regulation of VM and its possible mechanisms in a triple-negative breast cancer
cells (TNBCs) remain not clear. Therefore, we examined the effect of GSPs on VM
information in HCC1937 cell model. In this study, we identified the VM structure 
via the three-dimensional (3D) matrix in vitro. Cell viability was measured using
the CCK8 assay. The effects of GSPs on human triple-negative breast cancer cells 
(TNBCs) HCC1937 in terms of related proteins of VM information were determined
using western blot analysis. In vitro, the tubular networks were found in highly 
invasive HCC1937 cells but not in the non-invasive MCF-7 cells when plated on
matrigel. The number of vascular channels was significantly reduced when cells
were exposed in GSPs (100 µg/ml) and GSPs (200 µg/ml) groups (all p<0.001).
Furthermore, we found that treatment with GSPs promoted transition of the
mesenchymal state to the epithelial state in HCC1937 cells as well as reducing
the expression of Twist1 protein, a master EMT regulator.GSPs has the ability to 
inhibit VM information by the suppression of Twist1 protein that could be related
to the reversal of epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) process. It is firstly
concluded that GSPs may be an potential anti-VM botanical agent for human TNBCs.

p27 restrains normal cell growth, but PI3K-dependent C-terminal phosphorylation
of p27 at threonine 157 (T157) and T198 promotes cancer cell invasion. Here, we
describe an oncogenic feedforward loop in which p27pT157pT198 binds Janus kinase 
2 (JAK2) promoting STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3)
recruitment and activation. STAT3 induces TWIST1 to drive a p27-dependent
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and further activates AKT contributing to
acquisition and maintenance of metastatic potential. p27 knockdown in highly
metastatic PI3K-activated cells reduces STAT3 binding to the TWIST1 promoter,
TWIST1 promoter activity and TWIST1 expression, reverts EMT and impairs
metastasis, whereas activated STAT3 rescues p27 knockdown. Cell cycle-defective
phosphomimetic p27T157DT198D (p27CK-DD) activates STAT3 to induce a
TWIST1-dependent EMT in human mammary epithelial cells and increases breast and
bladder cancer invasion and metastasis. Data support a mechanism in which
PI3K-deregulated p27 binds JAK2, to drive STAT3 activation and EMT through
STAT3-mediated TWIST1 induction. Furthermore, STAT3, once activated, feeds
forward to further activate AKT.

Sclerostin antibody (Scl-Ab) increases bone formation through a process dependent
on the activation of canonical Wnt signaling, although the specific signaling in 
the osteoblast lineage in vivo is largely unknown. To gain insight into the
signaling pathways acutely modulated by Scl-Ab, the transcriptional response of
subpopulations of the osteoblast lineage was assessed by TaqMan and microarray
analyses of mRNA isolated from laser capture microdissection (LCM)-enriched
samples from the vertebrae of ovariectomized rats during the first week after
Scl-Ab administration. Briefly, 6-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats were
ovariectomized and, after 2 months, received a single dose of vehicle (VEH) or
100<U+2009>mg/kg Scl-Ab (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>20/group). Lumbar vertebrae were collected at 6, 24, 72,
and 168<U+2009>hours postdose and cryosectioned for LCM. Osteocytes were captured from
bone matrix, and osteoblasts and lining cells were captured from bone surfaces
based on fluorochrome labeling. mRNA was isolated, amplified, and profiled by
TaqMan and microarray. Expression analysis revealed that Scl-Ab caused strikingly
similar transcriptional profiles across all three cell types. Only 13 known
canonical Wnt target genes, the majority with known functions in bone, showed a
significant change in expression by microarray in response to Scl-Ab, with Wisp1 
and Twist1 being the most responsive. Coincident with increased expression of Wnt
target genes was the upregulation of numerous extracellular matrix (ECM) genes.
The acute and progressive upregulation of ECM genes in lining cells supports
their activation into matrix-producing osteoblasts, consistent with
modeling-based bone formation. A similar transcriptional profile in osteocytes
may indicate that Scl-Ab stimulates perilacunar/pericanalicular matrix
deposition. Pathway analyses indicated that Scl-Ab regulated a limited number of 
genes related to cell cycle arrest and B-cell development. These data describe
the acute downstream signaling in response to Scl-Ab in vivo and demonstrate
selected canonical Wnt target gene activation associated with increased bone
formation in all mature osteoblast subpopulations.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been implicated in the development of
a number of cancers. An important EMT inducer, TWIST, has been detected to be
over-expressed in a variety of tumors, but rarely been studied in nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma (NPC). This study aimed to examine TWIST expression and its association
with clinicopathological factors and prognosis in NPC. A total of 65 NPC and 20
normal samples were involved in the present study. RT-PCR and
immunohistochemistry were used to examine the mRNA and protein expressions of
TWIST in NPC and normal tissues. The relationship of TWIST expression levels with
clinical features and prognosis of NPC patients were analyzed. The positive rate 
of TWIST expression was markedly higher in NPC tissues than that in normal
tissues. Over-expression of TWIST was correlated with N stage and the presence of
distant metastasis. Patients with positive TWIST expression had a significantly
shorter overall survival time relative to patients with negative TWIST
expression. The data suggest that TWIST over-expression has a correlation with
lymphatic and distant metastasis in NPC. Moreover, it might be a novel biomarker 
for prediction of advanced tumor progression and a potential unfavorable
prognostic factor as well as a potential treatment target for NPC.

TWIST proteins are important for development of embryonic skeletal muscle and
play a role in the metabolism of tumor and white adipose tissue. The impact of
TWIST on metabolism in skeletal muscle is incompletely studied. Our aim was to
assess the impact of TWIST1 and TWIST2 overexpression on glucose and lipid
metabolism. In intact mouse muscle, overexpression of Twist reduced total
glycogen content without altering glucose uptake. Expression of TWIST1 or TWIST2 
reduced Pdk4 mRNA, while increasing mRNA levels of Il6, Tnfa, and Il1ß.
Phosphorylation of AKT was increased and protein abundance of acetyl CoA
carboxylase (ACC) was decreased in skeletal muscle overexpressing TWIST1 or
TWIST2. Glycogen synthesis and fatty acid oxidation remained stable in C2C12
cells overexpressing TWIST1 or TWIST2. Finally, skeletal muscle mRNA levels
remain unaltered in ob/ob mice, type 2 diabetic patients, or in healthy subjects 
before and after 3 months of exercise training. Collectively, our results
indicate that TWIST1 and TWIST2 are expressed in skeletal muscle. Overexpression 
of these proteins impacts proteins in metabolic pathways and mRNA level of
cytokines. However, skeletal muscle levels of TWIST transcripts are unaltered in 
metabolic diseases.

The urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is closely associated with
poor prognosis in various aggressive cancers including large-cell lung cancer
(LCLC). Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) refers to the unique capability of aggressive
tumor cells to mimic the pattern of embryonic vasculogenic networks involving the
blood supply in early tumor formation. We demonstrate the statistically positive 
correlation of uPAR expression with VM formation, metastasis, and poor prognosis 
of LCLC patients. uPAR(+) cells sorted from the LCLC H460 cell line show higher
invasion, migration capacity, and tube structure formation capability on Matrigel
compared with uPAR(-) cells. uPAR(+) tumor cells highly expressed vimentin and
VE-cadherin; the epithelial marker E-cadherin was low expressed. Higher
EMT-regulated protein twist and snail expressions were also observed in these
cells. uPAR(+) cells injected subcutaneously into nude mice markedly increased
tumor growth, induced VM formation and liver metastasis; by contrast, uPAR(-)
cells did not. The data suggest that uPAR expression may predict VM formation,
tumor metastasis and poorer prognosis of LCLC patients. The uPAR gene may be used
as a novel therapeutic target for inhibiting angiogenesis and metastasis in LCLC.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is critical for the invasion and
metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, to date, the association
of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) with EMT, and its
mediated tumor invasion and metastasis in HCC, remain elusive. We investigated
the relationship between STAT3 activation and EMT, and the underlying mechanisms 
involved in HCC progression. By stable transfection, we successfully
overexpressed STAT3 in low metastatic SMMC7721 cells and silenced STAT3
expression in high metastatic MHCC97H cells. The EMT-associated molecular HCC
cell changes were analyzed by real-time PCR, western blotting and
immunocytochemical methods. The EMT-mediated HCC cell invasion and migration were
evaluated by a Transwell cell invasion and cell migration assay, respectively.
The interaction between STAT3 and Twist (a key EMT inducer) was evaluated by
dual-luciferase reporter assay. In the present study, we found that STAT3
overexpression significantly reduced E-cadherin and ß-cadherin, and it enhanced
N-cadherin and vimentin expression in the SMMC7721 cells. STAT3 knockdown
significantly increased E-cadherin and ß-cadherin, and it decreased N-cadherin
and vimentin expression in the MHCC97H cells. Meanwhile, a dual-luciferase
reporter assay revealed that STAT3 may bind the Twist promoter, mediate its
transcriptional activity, and then promote the EMT process in HCC cells. STAT3
activation-mediated EMT also evidently enhanced HCC cell invasion and migration. 
In summary, the present study demonstrated for the first time that STAT3 may
cooperate with Twist to mediate EMT and induce HCC invasion and metastasis.
Activated STAT3, Twist, and EMT markers may serve as potential molecular targets 
in the prevention and/or treatment of HCC invasion and metastasis.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer morbidity and mortality
worldwide. Although response rates and overall survival have been improved in
recent years, resistance to multiple drug combinations is inevitable. Therefore, 
the development of more efficient drugs, with fewer side effects is urgently
needed. To this end, we have investigated in the present report the effect of
PAC, a novel cucumin analogue, on CRC cells both in vitro and in vivo. We have
shown that PAC induces apoptosis, mainly via the internal mitochondrial route,
and inhibits cell proliferation through delaying the cell cycle at G2/M phase.
Interestingly, the pro-apoptotic effect was mediated through STAT3-dependent
down-regulation of cyclin D1 and its downstream target survivin. Indeed, change
in the expression level of cyclin D1 modulated the expression of survivin and the
response of CRC cells to PAC. Furthermore, using the ChIP assay, we have shown
PAC-dependent reduction in the binding of STAT3 to the cyclin D1 promoter in
vivo. Additionally, PAC suppressed the epithelial-to-mesenchymal process through 
down-regulating the mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin and Twist1) and
inhibiting the invasion/migration abilities of the CRC cells via repressing the
pro-migration/invasion protein kinases AKT and ERK1/2. In addition, PAC inhibited
tumor growth and repressed the JAK2/STAT3, AKT/mTOR and MEK/ERK pathways as well 
as their common downstream effectors cyclin D1 and survivin in humanized CRC
xenografts. Collectively, these results indicate that PAC has potent anti-CRC
effects, and therefore could constitute an effective alternative chemotherapeutic
agent, which may consolidate the adjuvant treatment of colon cancer. © 2015 Wiley

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was shown to enhance metastatic abilities
of cancer cells, but it remains elusive in clinical samples. Moreover, EMT is
rarely studied in lymph node metastases (LNM), thus limiting our understanding of
its role outside of the primary tumors (PT). We collected a set of samples
including triplets - PT, circulating tumor cells (CTCs)-enriched blood samples
and LNM from 108 early breast cancer patients. With immunohistochemistry we
analyzed levels of EMT effectors - E-cadherin, vimentin and N-cadherin in LNM,
central areas and margins of PT. Additionally, expression of EMT core regulators 
TWIST1, SNAI1, SNAI2 was measured with RT-qPCR. Patients with E-cadherin loss had
CTCs in 45% of the cases in comparison to 23% with normal E-cadherin level (P =
0.05). Mesenchymal phenotype of CTCs-enriched blood fractions was five-times more
frequent in patients with E-cadherin loss in PT compared to PT with normal
E-cadherin levels (P = 0.01). Epithelial/mesenchymal status of matched samples at
different stages of dissemination was frequently discordant, especially for pairs
involving CTCs, indicating high plasticity of tumor cells. LNM showed increased
expression of TWIST1, SNAI1, SNAI2 accompanied by decreased Ki67 labeling index, 
with median Ki67 of 15% in PT and 10% in LNM (P = 0.0002). Our findings
demonstrate that E-cadherin loss, not only in PT margin, might lead to seeding of
especially malignant CTCs with mesenchymal phenotype. In comparison to PT, cells 
in LNM re-express E-cadherin, upregulate EMT transcription factors and reduce
cell division rate, which could be viewed as their long-term survival strategy.

Tumor metastasis involves circulating and tumor-initiating capacities of
metastatic cancer cells. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is related to
self-renewal capacity and circulating tumor cell (CTC) characteristics for tumor 
metastasis. Although tumor metastasis is a life-threatening, complicated process 
that occurs through circulation of tumor cells, mechanistic aspects of
self-renewal and circulating capacities have been largely unknown. Hepatic
transmembrane 4 L six family member 5 (TM4SF5) promotes EMT for malignant growth 
and migration, so it was rationalized that TM4SF5, as a hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) biomarker, might be important for metastatic potential. Here, self-renewal 
capacity by TM4SF5 was mechanistically explored using hepatocarcinoma cells with 
or without TM4SF5 expression, and we explored whether they became CTCs using
mouse liver-orthotopic model systems. We found that TM4SF5-dependent sphere
growth correlated with CD24(-) , aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, as well 
as a physical association between CD44 and TM4SF5. Interaction between TM4SF5 and
CD44 was through their extracellular domains with N-glycosylation modifications. 
TM4SF5/CD44 interaction activated proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src
(c-Src)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)/Twist-related 
protein 1 (Twist1)/B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site
1 (Bmi1) signaling for spheroid formation, whereas disturbing the interaction,
expression, or activity of any component in this signaling pathway inhibited
spheroid formation. In serial xenografts using 200~5,000 cells per injection,
TM4SF5-positive tumors exhibited subpopulations with locally increased CD44
expressions, supporting for tumor cell differentiation. TM4SF5-positive, but not 
TM4SF5- or CD44-knocked-down, cells were identified circulating in blood 4-6
weeks after orthotopic liver injection using in vivo laser scanning
endomicroscopy. Anti-TM4SF5 reagent blocked their metastasis to distal intestinal
organs.CONCLUSION: TM4SF5 promotes self-renewal and CTC properties supported by
TM4SF5(+) /CD44(+(TM4SF5-bound)) /ALDH(+) /CD24(-) markers during HCC metastasis.

Cancer is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and plasma d-dimer (DD) 
and tissue factor (TF) are established VTE associated markers. Circulating tumor 
cells (CTCs) are associated with the risk of VTE in metastatic breast cancer.
This study aimed to correlate CTCs, blood coagulation and the urokinase
plasminogen activator (uPA) system in primary breast cancer (PBC) patients. This 
prospective study included 116 PBC patients treated by primary surgery. CTCs were
detected by quantitative RT-PCR assay for expression of epithelial (CK19) or
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes (TWIST1, SNAIL1, SLUG, ZEB1,
FOXC2). Plasma DD, TF, uPA system proteins were detected by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays, while expressions of uPA system in surgical specimens were 
evaluated by immunohistochemistry. CTCs were detected in 27.6% patients. Patients
with CTCs had a significantly higher mean plasma DD (ng/mL) than those of
patients without CTCs (632.4 versus 365.4, p = 0.000004). There was no
association between plasma TF and CTCs. Epithelial CTCs exhibit higher expression
of uPA system genes compared to EMT_CTCs. Patients with CTCs had higher plasma
uPA proteins than those of patients without CTCs; there was no correlation
between tissue expression of uPA system, CTCs, DD or TF levels. In multivariate
analysis CTCs and patients age were independent factors associated with plasma
DD. We found association between plasma DD and CTCs indicating a potential role
for activation of the coagulation cascade in the early metastatic process. CTCs
could be directly involved in coagulation activation or increased CTCs could be
marker of aggressive disease and increased VTE risk.

The TWIST1 gene has diverse roles in development and pathologic diseases such as 
cancer. TWIST1 is a dimeric basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor
existing as TWIST1-TWIST1 or TWIST1-E12/47. TWIST1 partner choice and DNA binding
can be influenced during development by phosphorylation of Thr125 and Ser127 of
the Thr-Gln-Ser (TQS) motif within the bHLH of TWIST1. The significance of these 
TWIST1 phosphorylation sites for metastasis is unknown. We created stable
isogenic prostate cancer cell lines overexpressing TWIST1 wild-type,
phospho-mutants, and tethered versions. We assessed these isogenic lines using
assays that mimic stages of cancer metastasis. In vitro assays suggested the
phospho-mimetic Twist1-DQD mutation could confer cellular properties associated
with pro-metastatic behavior. The hypo-phosphorylation mimic Twist1-AQA mutation 
displayed reduced pro-metastatic activity compared to wild-type TWIST1 in vitro, 
suggesting that phosphorylation of the TWIST1 TQS motif was necessary for
pro-metastatic functions. In vivo analysis demonstrates that the Twist1-AQA
mutation exhibits reduced capacity to contribute to metastasis, whereas the
expression of the Twist1-DQD mutation exhibits proficient metastatic potential.
Tethered TWIST1-E12 heterodimers phenocopied the Twist1-DQD mutation for many in 
vitro assays, suggesting that TWIST1 phosphorylation may result in
heterodimerization in prostate cancer cells. Lastly, the dual
phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
inhibitor BEZ235 strongly attenuated TWIST1-induced migration that was dependent 
on the TQS motif. TWIST1 TQS phosphorylation state determines the intensity of
TWIST1-induced pro-metastatic ability in prostate cancer cells, which may be
partly explained mechanistically by TWIST1 dimeric partner choice.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important process implicated in
tumor invasion and metastasis. Twist1 is a transcription factor that induces EMT,
including E-cadherin suppression and cancer cell migration and invasion; hence it
promotes cancer metastasis. Twist1 directly or indirectly regulates the
expression of various genes and cellular functions involved in cancer
progression. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this
study, we investigated the molecular basis for Twist1-mediated invasion and EMT. 
In human cancer cells, Twist1 was found to directly upregulate transcription of
the mesenchymal gene integrin a5 in an E-box-independent, but activating
protein-1 (AP-1) element-dependent, manner. Twist1 activated the integrin a5
promoter by interacting with and activating the transcription factor AP-1,
composed of c-Jun and activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2); it also enhanced
the nuclear presence of ATF-2. AP-1 was critical for Twist1-induced cancer cell
invasion, primarily through the induction of integrin a5, which activated c-Jun
N-terminal kinase and focal adhesion kinase-signaling activities. Using data from
The Cancer Genome Atlas, we found that Twist1 expression positively correlates
with integrin a5 expression in human colorectal cancers. These findings suggest
that cooperation between Twist1 and AP-1 represents a novel mechanism for EMT and
tumor invasiveness. This study supports further investigation into the molecular 
basis underlying the diverse Twist1-mediated functions that occur during tumor
progression.

Aberrant expression of miR-10b has been described in many cancers but remains
unexplored in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Therefore, we aimed to study the
miR-10b expression level in 43 NPC biopsies collected from Tunisian patients and 
three NPC xenografts. Then, we investigated the correlation between miR-10b
expression and its upstream regulators LMP1/Twist1 as well as its adjacent gene
HoxD4. We showed that miR-10b was significantly up-regulated in NPC biopsies
compared to non-tumor nasopharyngeal tissues (fold change 153; p = 0.004) and
associated with advanced clinical stage and young age at diagnosis (p = 0.005 and
p = 0.011, respectively). In addition, over-expression of miR-10b was positively 
associated with the transcription factor Twist1 as well as the EBV oncoprotein
LMP1 (fold change 6.32; p = 0.014, fold change 6.58; p = 0.01 respectively).
Furthermore, higher level of miR-10b was observed in tumors with simultaneous
expression of LMP1 and Twist1, compared to those expressing only Twist1 (fold
change 2.49; p = 0.033). Meanwhile, the analysis of the link between miR-10b and 
its neighbor gene HoxD4 did not show any significant correlation (Fisher test p =
0.205; Mann-Whitney test p = 0.676). This study reports the first evidence of
miR-10b over-expression in NPC patients. Furthermore, our findings can support
hsa-miR-10b gene regulation through LMP1/Twist1 in NPC malignancy.

While Notch signaling plays a critical role in the regulation of cartilage
formation, its downstream targets are unknown. To address this we performed gain 
and losses of function experiments and demonstrate that Notch inhibition of
chondrogenesis acts via up-regulation of the transcription factor Twist1. Upon
Notch activation, murine limb bud mesenchymal progenitor cells in micromass
culture displayed an inhibition of chondrogenesis. Twist1 was found to be
exclusively expressed in mesenchymal progenitor cells at the onset stage of
chondrogenesis during Notch activation. Inhibition of Notch signaling in these
cells significantly reduced protein expression of Twist1. Furthermore, the
inhibition effect of NICD1 on MPC chondrogenesis was markedly reduced by knocking
down of Twist1. Constitutively active Notch signaling significantly enhanced
Twist1 promoter activity; whereas mutation studies indicated that a putative
NICD/RBPjK binding element in the promoter region is required for the
Notch-responsiveness of the Twist1 promoter. Finally, chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays further confirmed that the Notch intracellular domain 
influences Twist1 by directly binding to the Twist1 promoter. These data provide 
a novel insight into understanding the molecular mechanisms behind Notch
inhibition of the onset of chondrogenesis.

BACKGROUND: The vascular remodeling responsible for pulmonary arterial
hypertension (PAH) involves predominantly the accumulation of a-smooth muscle
actin-expressing mesenchymal-like cells in obstructive pulmonary vascular
lesions. Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) may be a source of those 
a-smooth muscle actin-expressing cells.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In situ evidence of EndoMT in human PAH was obtained by
using confocal microscopy of multiple fluorescent stainings at the arterial
level, and by using transmission electron microscopy and correlative light and
electron microscopy at the ultrastructural level. Findings were confirmed by in
vitro analyses of human PAH and control cultured pulmonary artery endothelial
cells. In addition, the mRNA and protein signature of EndoMT was recognized at
the arterial and lung level by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
and Western blot analyses. We confirmed our human observations in established
animal models of pulmonary hypertension (monocrotaline and SuHx). After
establishing the first genetically modified rat model linked to BMPR2 mutations
(BMPR2(<U+0394>140Ex1/+) rats), we demonstrated that EndoMT is linked to alterations in 
signaling of BMPR2, a gene that is mutated in 70% of cases of familial PAH and in
10% to 40% of cases of idiopathic PAH. We identified molecular actors of this
pathological transition, including twist overexpression and vimentin
phosphorylation. We demonstrated that rapamycin partially reversed the protein
expression patterns of EndoMT, improved experimental PAH, and decreased the
migration of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells, providing the proof of
concept that EndoMT is druggable.
CONCLUSIONS: EndoMT is linked to alterations in BPMR2 signaling and is involved
in the occlusive vas cular remodeling of PAH, findings that may have therapeutic 
implications.

and acquired chemoresistance independently of ABC transporters.

The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has been implicated in acquired
chemoresistance. However, it remains unclear whether and how the Hh pathway may
maintain the chemoresistant phenotype by controlling the tumor-initiating
cell-like properties of acquired chemoresistant cancer cells. In this study,
using well-established acquired chemoresistant cancer cells and chemosensitive KB
cancer cells with artificially elevated Hh pathway activity, we found that Hh
pathway activity may transcriptionally control the expression of twist1 and
snail, thereby maintaining the tumor-initiating cell-like properties and
consequently the chemoresistant phenotype. Meanwhile, we obtained direct evidence
that twist1, which may amplify Hh signaling activity and plays an essential role 
in limb development, is a direct transcriptional target of Gli, similar to snail.
We further observed that the expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters was dispensable for the chemoresistance mediated by twist1 and
snail. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that twist1, together with snail,
links the Hh pathway to the tumor-initiating cell-like properties of
chemoresistant cells. This consequently promotes chemoresistance independently of
ABC transporters, thereby contributing to future development of strategies for
combating chemoresistance through Hh pathway interference. Furthermore, our
finding that twist1 is a direct target of the transcription factor Gli improves
the interpretation of the association between twist1 and the Hh pathway and the
nature of the signaling transduction of the Hh pathway.

The stem cell populations in cancerous tissues and cell lines vary widely and are
often associated with aggressive cases of breast cancer. Despite research on the 
topic, the mechanism underlying the regulation of the breast cancer stem cell
(BCSC) population within tumors remains to be fully elucidated. To investigate
the function of special AT-rich sequence-binding protein-1 (SATB1) in the
maintenance of the BCSC population, SATB1 was overexpressed with lentivirus in
MCF-7 cells or knocked down with shRNA-lentivirus in BT-549 cells. The effects of
SATB1 overexpression or knockdown on mammosphere formation, the size of the of
BCSC population, cell invasion and tumorigenesis were investigated. Activation of
the Notch signaling pathway and expression of Snail1 and Twist1 were also
examined in the cells. Overexpression of SATB1 in MCF-7 cells was observed to
increase mammosphere formation, the size of the BCSC population, cell invasion
and tumorigenesis, accompanied by an increase in the activation of Notch
signaling and expression levels of Snail1 and Twist1. Conversely, knockdown of
SATB1 in BT-549 cells produced the opposite effects. The results indicated that
expression of SATB1 may increase the size of the BCSC population via the
activation of the Notch signaling pathway and by increasing expression levels of 
Snail1 and Twist1.

Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors are pivotal regulators of
cellular differentiation and development. The bHLH factor, Twist-1 has previously
been found to control bone marrow stromal/stem cells (BMSC) self-renewal, life
span, and differentiation, however not much is known about its mechanism of
action. In this study, we have discovered a novel Twist-1 regulated bHLH gene,
Hes4, expressed in humans, but not in mice. Its closest homologue in both humans 
and mice is Hes1. Overexpression and knockdown studies demonstrated that Hes4
promotes osteogenesis resulting in an increase in Runx2, osteocalcin,
osteopontin, and bone sialoprotein expression. Conversely, Hes4 was found to
inhibit adipogenesis accompanied by a decrease in PPAR<U+03B3>2, adiponectin, and
adipsin expression. In vitro studies indicate that Hes4 employs a mechanism to
counteract the negative function of Twist-1 on osteogenesis by binding to Twist-1
and inhibiting the ability of Twist-1 to bind and inhibit Runx2. In vivo
chromatin immunoprecipitation and in vitro reporter assays illustrated that Runx2
recruitment to the osterix promoter, was found to be enhanced in the presence of 
Hes4 and inhibited in the presence of Twist-1. Therefore, Hes4 antagonizes the
function of Twist-1 to regulate lineage commitment of BMSC. These studies
highlight the potential differences in molecular mechanisms that regulate BMSC
osteogenic differentiation between human and mouse.

Master regulators of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition such as Twist1 and
Snail1 have been implicated in invasiveness and the generation of cancer stem
cells, but their persistent activity inhibits stem-cell-like properties and the
outgrowth of disseminated cancer cells into macroscopic metastases. Here, we show
that Twist1 activation primes a subset of mammary epithelial cells for
stem-cell-like properties, which only emerge and stably persist following Twist1 
deactivation. Consequently, when cells undergo a mesenchymal-epithelial
transition (MET), they do not return to their original epithelial cell state,
evidenced by acquisition of invasive growth behavior and a distinct gene
expression profile. These data provide an explanation for how transient Twist1
activation may promote all steps of the metastatic cascade; i.e., invasion,
dissemination, and metastatic outgrowth at distant sites.

Twist1 promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, metastasis,
and cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. However, it remains unclear whether Twist1
is also required for tumor initiation and whether Twist1-induced cancer stemness 
and EMT are functionally linked. Using a conditional deletion of Twist1 at
different stages of skin carcinogenesis, we show that Twist1 is required for skin
tumor initiation and progression in a gene-dosage-dependent manner. Moreover,
conditional ablation of Twist1 in benign tumors leads to increased apoptosis,
reduced cell proliferation, and defective tumor maintenance and propagation
independently of its EMT-inducing abilities. Concomitant deletion of Twist1 and
p53 rescues the apoptotic response, but not the cell proliferation and
propagation defects. These results reveal that Twist1 is required for tumor
initiation and maintenance in a p53-dependent and -independent manner.
Importantly, our findings also indicate that tumor stemness and EMT can be
regulated by distinct mechanisms.

Twist1 has a well-established role in inducing Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition 
(EMT) to promote tumor invasion and metastasis and can also inhibit apoptosis and
confer stemness. In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Beck et al. (2015) now show
that low levels of Twist1 are essential for tumor initiation, maintenance, and
stemness independent of its EMT-inducing activity.

The transcription factor sex determining region Y-box protein 5 (SOX5) plays
important roles in various types of cancers. However, the expression and function
of SOX5 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been elucidated. Here, we
found that SOX5 is significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines.
Gain- and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that SOX5 promoted HCC cell
migration and invasion. In addition, we revealed that SOX5 is linked to
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by regulation of Twist1. Our results
indicate for the first time that SOX5 is a novel regulator of EMT in HCC and may 
be a potential therapeutic target for HCC metastasis.

Epigenetic mechanisms are important in different neurological disorders, and one 
such mechanism is histone acetylation. The multivalent chromatin regulator BRPF1 
(bromodomain- and plant homeodomain-linked (PHD) zinc finger-containing protein
1) recognizes different epigenetic marks and activates three histone
acetyltransferases, so it is both a reader and a co-writer of the epigenetic
language. The three histone acetyltransferases are MOZ, MORF, and HBO1, which are
also known as lysine acetyltransferase 6A (KAT6A), KAT6B, and KAT7, respectively.
The MORF gene is mutated in four neurodevelopmental disorders sharing the
characteristic of intellectual disability and frequently displaying callosal
agenesis. Here, we report that forebrain-specific inactivation of the mouse Brpf1
gene caused early postnatal lethality, neocortical abnormalities, and partial
callosal agenesis. With respect to the control, the mutant forebrain contained
fewer Tbr2-positive intermediate neuronal progenitors and displayed aberrant
neurogenesis. Molecularly, Brpf1 loss led to decreased transcription of multiple 
genes, such as Robo3 and Otx1, important for neocortical development.
Surprisingly, elevated expression of different Hox genes and various other
transcription factors, such as Lhx4, Foxa1, Tbx5, and Twist1, was also observed. 
These results thus identify an important role of Brpf1 in regulating forebrain
development and suggest that it acts as both an activator and a silencer of gene 
expression in vivo.

AIM: To explore the correlation between Twist-related protein (Twist)1,
fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)2 and gastric adenocarcinoma
differentiation and progression.
METHODS: We evaluated Twist1 and FGFR2 in 52 gastric adenocarcinoma samples by
immunohistochemistry and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, and
analyzed the correlation between Twist1, FGFR2 and cancer differentiation. We
also detected Twist1 and FGFR2 expression in gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines,
and evaluated Twist1 influence on FGFR2 expression. In addition, we studied the
role of FGFR2 in Twist1-promoted cancer progression, including proliferation,
invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
RESULTS: Twist1 and FGFR2 were detected in almost all the gastric adenocarcinoma 
samples. Twist1 (P = 0.0213) and FGFR2 (P = 0.0310) mRNA levels had a significant
association with gastric adenocarcinoma differentiation. Moreover, Twist1 and
FGFR2 expression in poorly differentiated cells (SNU-1 and SNU-16) was notably
higher than in well-differentiated cells (MKN-7 and MKN-28). In poorly
differentiated gastric adenocarcinomas, FGFR2 mRNA level was significantly
positively correlated with Twist1 mRNA level (P = 0.004). Twist1 was proved to
promote FGFR2 by regulating Twist1 expression by knockdown and overexpression.
Additionally, Twist1 could induce proliferation, invasion and EMT in gastric
cancer; of these, FGFR2 was required for invasion and EMT, rather than
proliferation.
CONCLUSION: Twist1 and FGFR2 are highly associated with differentiation of
gastric adenocarcinoma; Twist1 can facilitate invasion and EMT in gastric
adenocarcinoma via promotion of FGFR2 expression.

Tumor budding in colorectal cancer is likened to an epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) characterized predominantly by loss of E-cadherin and
up-regulation of E-cadherin repressors like TWIST1 and TWIST2. Here we
investigate a possible epigenetic link between TWIST proteins and the tumor
budding phenotype. TWIST1 and TWIST2 promoter methylation and protein expression 
were investigated in six cell lines and further correlated with tumor budding in 
patient cohort 1 (n = 185). Patient cohort 2 (n = 112) was used to assess
prognostic effects. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) of tumor epithelium and
stroma from low- and high-grade budding cancers was performed. In colorectal
cancers, TWIST1 and TWIST2 expression was essentially restricted to stromal
cells. LCM results of a high-grade budding case show positive TWIST1 and TWIST2
stroma and no methylation, while the low-grade budding case was characterized by 
negative stroma and strong hypermethylation. TWIST1 stromal cell staining was
associated with adverse features like more advanced pT (p = 0.0044), lymph node
metastasis (p = 0.0301), lymphatic vessel invasion (p = 0.0373), perineural
invasion (p = 0.0109) and worse overall survival time (p = 0.0226). Stromal cells
may influence tumor budding in colorectal cancers through expression of TWIST1.
Hypermethylation of the tumor stroma may represent an alternative mechanism for
regulation of TWIST1.

Curcumin has therapeutic potential in preventing several types of cancer,
including colon, liver, prostate, and breast. The goal of this study was to
evaluate the chemopreventive activity of systemically administered curcumin on
oral carcinogenesis induced by 4-nitroquinolone-1-oxide (4-NQO). A total of 50
male albino rats, Rattus norvegicus, (Holtzman), were divided into five groups
(n<U+2009>=<U+2009>10 per group). Four of these groups were exposed to 50<U+2009>ppm 4-NQO in their
drinking water ad libitum for 8 or 12 weeks, two groups were treated with
curcumin by oral gavage at 30 or 100<U+2009>mg/kg per day, and one group was treated
with corn oil (vehicle) only. The negative control group was euthanized at
baseline. Tongues of all animals were removed after euthanasia and used in the
subsequent analysis because the tongue is the primary site of carcinogenesis in
this model. Descriptive histological analysis and immunohistochemistry for PCNA, 
Bcl-2, SOCS1 e-3, and STAT3 were performed to assess the oncogenic process. The
gene expression of Vimentin, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, or TWIST1 was assessed using
RT-qPCR as a representative of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) events.
The administration of curcumin at 100<U+2009>mg/kg during the 12 weeks markedly
decreased the expression of PCNA, Bcl-2, SOCS1 e -3, and STAT3. Curcumin also
minimized the cellular atypia under microscopic analysis and diminished the
expression of the genes associated with EMT. These findings demonstrate that the 
systemic administration of curcumin has chemopreventive activity during oral
carcinogenesis induced by 4-NQO.

Twist-BRD4 complex: potential drug target for basal-like breast cancer.

As an important basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, Twist
associates with several physiological processes such as mesodermal development,
and pathological processes such as Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. During cancer
progression, Twist induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), potentiating 
cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Although many studies have revealed its
multiple biological roles, it remained unclear how Twist transcriptionally
activates targeted genes. Recently we discovered tip60-mediated Twist
di-acetylation in the ''histone H4-mimic'' GK-X-GK motif. The di-acetylated Twist
recruits BRD4 and related transcriptional components to super-enhancer of its
targeted genes during progression of basal-like breast cancer (BLBC). Here, we
review this new advance of regulation and functional mechanism of Twist.

Many epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-promoting transcription factors have
been implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis as well as chemoresistance of
cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms mediating these processes are unclear.
Here, we report that Foxq1, a forkhead box-containing transcription factor and
EMT-inducing gene, promotes stemness traits and chemoresistance in mammary
epithelial cells. Using an expression profiling assay, we identified Twist1,
Zeb2, and PDGFRa and ß as Foxq1 downstream targets. We further show that PDGFRa
and ß can be directly regulated by Foxq1 or indirectly regulated through the
Foxq1/Twist1 axis. Knockdown of both PDGFRa and ß results in more significant
effects on reversing Foxq1-promoted oncogenesis in vitro and in vivo than
knockdown of either PDGFRa or ß alone. In addition, PDGFRß is a more potent
mediator of Foxq1-promoted stemness traits than PDGFRa. Finally, pharmacologic
inhibition or gene silencing of PDGFRs sensitizes mammary epithelial cells to
chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in vivo. These findings collectively
implicate PDGFRs as critical mediators of breast cancer oncogenesis and
chemoresistance driven by Foxq1, with potential implications for developing novel
therapeutic combinations to treat breast cancer.

miR-23a promotes cisplatin chemoresistance and protects against cisplatin-induced
apoptosis in tongue squamous cell carcinoma cells through Twist.

Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) is one of the most common head and neck
cancers. Cisplatin is effective as a single agent or in combination with other
drugs for the treatment of TSCC. Treatment with cisplatin-based chemotherapy has 
been found to improve the prognosis of patients with TSCC. However, one of the
most important clinical issues of cisplatin-based TSCC chemotherapy is the
intrinsic/acquired chemoresistance to cisplatin. Increased expression of miR-23a 
reportedly promotes cisplatin chemoresistance in TSCC cells. High expression of
Twist is also associated with cancer chemoresistance and poor prognosis of TSCC
patients. In the present study, we explored the interaction between miR-23a and
Twist in TSCC cells, and assessed its impact on TSCC chemoresistance to
cisplatin. miR-23a and/or Twist were overexpressed or knocked down in SCC-4 and
Tca8113 human TSCC cells. The expression levels of miR-23a and Twist were
determined. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of cisplatin and
cell apoptosis rate under cisplatin treatment were used as measures of cisplatin 
chemoresistance. Overexpression of miR-23a in both SCC-4 and Tca8113 cells
markedly increased Twist expression, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity and
the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of cisplain, and decreased
cisplatin-induced apoptosis, all of which was abolished by knockdown of Twist or 
selective JNK inhibitor SP600125. On the other hand, knockdown of miR-23a
significantly decreased Twist expression, JNK activity and IC50 of cisplain, and 
increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis, all of which was completely reversed by
overexpression of Twist. In conclusion, the present study for the first time
demonstrates that miR-23a promotes cisplatin chemoresistance and protects
cisplatin-induced apoptosis in TSCC cells through inducing Twist expression by a 
JNK-dependent mechanism. It adds new insights into the molecular mechanisms
underlying TSCC chemoresistance.

BACKGROUND: Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is thought to be an essential
feature of malignant tumor cells when they spread into the stroma. Despite the
extracellular acidity of tumor tissues, the effect of acidic extracellular pH (pH
e ) on EMT in carcinoma models, including the Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) model,
remains unclear.
METHODS: High and low metastatic LLC variants were generated by repeated tail
vein injection of metastatic cells. DMEM/F12 medium, which has been supplemented 
with 15 mM HEPES, 4 mM phosphoric acid, and 1 g/L NaHCO3 and adjusted to the
desire pH with HCl or NaOH, was used for cell culture. EMT marker gene expression
was determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
Migration and invasion activities were analyzed by wound healing assay and the
Boyden chamber assay through Matrigel®, respectively.
RESULTS: Low metastatic variant LLCm1 cells showed a cobble-stone like morphology
at pH e 7.4. At pH e 6.8, however, their morphology became fibroblastic, similar 
in shape to high metastatic variant LLCm4 cells. Steady state levels of matrix
metalloproteinase-9 (Mmp9) mRNA were induced by acidic pH e , maximizing at
pH 6.8, with the levels of Mmp9 mRNA higher in LLCm4 than in LLCm1 cells. Both
variants showed decreased levels of E-cadherin and increased levels of vimentin
at pH e 6.8. Acidic pH e also induced expression of mRNAs encoding the E-cadherin
repressors, Zeb2, Twist1 and Twist2, as well as enhancing cell motility and in
vitro invasion through Matrigel®.
CONCLUSIONS: Acidic pH e can induce EMT in some types of carcinoma.

The loss of the tumour suppressor E-cadherin (Cdh1) is a key event during
tumourigenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Transforming growth
factor-ß (TGFß) triggers EMT by inducing the expression of non-histone chromatin 
protein High Mobility Group A2 (HMGA2). We have previously shown that HMGA2,
together with Smads, regulate a network of EMT-transcription factors (EMT-TFs)
like Snail1, Snail2, ZEB1, ZEB2 and Twist1, most of which are well-known
repressors of the Cdh1 gene. In this study, we show that the Cdh1 promoter is
hypermethylated and epigenetically silenced in our constitutive EMT cell model,
whereby HMGA2 is ectopically expressed in mammary epithelial NMuMG cells and
these cells are highly motile and invasive. Furthermore, HMGA2 remodels the
chromatin to favour binding of de novo DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) to the
Cdh1 promoter. E-cadherin expression could be restored after treatment with the
DNA de-methylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Here, we describe a new
epigenetic role for HMGA2, which follows the actions that HMGA2 initiates via the
EMT-TFs, thus achieving sustained silencing of E-cadherin expression and
promoting tumour cell invasion.

(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate inhibits nasopharyngeal cancer stem cell
self-renewal and migration and reverses the epithelial-mesenchymal transition via
NF-<U+03BA>B p65 inactivation.

The cancer stem cell (CSC) theory states that many types of cancer, including
nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC), are initiated from and maintained by CSCs, which may
be responsible for tumor relapse and resistance to therapy. It is imperative that
nasopharyngeal cancer stem cells (NPCSCs) be specifically targeted to eradicate
NPC and prevent recurrence. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) inhibits cancer
progression by attenuating NF-<U+03BA>B p65 activity, which is upregulated in CSCs and
plays an important role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The purpose
of this study is to confirm the self-renewal and migration inhibitory effects of 
EGCG toward NPCSCs and to clarify its mechanism of activity. We enriched and
characterized NPCSCs by collecting spheroid-derived cells grown in serum-free
medium (SFM) and examined the effects of EGCG on the characteristics of NPCSCs
and studied the underlying mechanisms using soft agar colony assays, transwell
migration assays, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),
Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence staining, and xenograft studies. NPC
spheroids enriched from NPC cell lines acquired CSC traits and underwent EMT.
EGCG inhibited the NPCSCs' self-renewal and migration and reversed EMT, and
combined treatment with EGCG and cisplatin reduced the growth of CSC tumor
xenografts. Moreover, EGCG inhibited NF-<U+03BA>B p65 activity by modulating the
cellular localization of p65 and decreasing the transcriptional regulation of
NF-<U+03BA>B p65 on Twist1 expression. NF-<U+03BA>B p65 is a novel therapeutic target in
NPCSCs, and the inhibition of activated NF-<U+03BA>B p65 in CSCs by EGCG may offer an
effective treatment for NPC.

Repeatedly activated T helper 1 (Th1) cells present during chronic inflammation
can efficiently adapt to the inflammatory milieu, for example, by expressing the 
transcription factor Twist1, which limits the immunopathology caused by Th1
cells. Here, we show that in repeatedly activated murine Th1 cells, Twist1 and
T-bet induce expression of microRNA-148a (miR-148a). miR-148a regulates
expression of the proapoptotic gene Bim, resulting in a decreased Bim/Bcl2 ratio.
Inhibition of miR-148a by antagomirs in repeatedly activated Th1 cells increases 
the expression of Bim, leading to enhanced apoptosis. Knockdown of Bim expression
by siRNA in miR-148a antagomir-treated cells restores viability of the Th1 cells,
demonstrating that miR-148a controls survival by regulating Bim expression. Thus,
Twist1 and T-bet not only control the differentiation and function of Th1 cells, 
but also their persistence in chronic inflammation.

In neuroblastoma, MYCN amplification is associated with a worse prognosis and is 
a criterion used in the clinic to provide intensive treatments to children even
with localized disease. In correlation with MYCN amplification, upregulation of
TWIST1, a transcription factor playing a crucial role in inhibition of apoptosis 
and differentiation, was previously reported. Clinical data set analysis of MYCN,
MYC and TWIST1 expression permits us to confirm that TWIST1 expression is
upregulated in MYCN amplified neuroblastoma but also in a subset of neuroblastoma
harboring high expression of MYCN or MYC without gene amplification. In silico
analyses reveal the presence of several MYC regulatory motifs (E-Boxes and INR)
within the TWIST1 promoter. Using gel shift assay and reporter activity assays,
we demonstrate that both N-Myc and c-Myc proteins can bind and activate the
TWIST1 promoter. Therefore, we propose TWIST1 as a direct MYC transcriptional
target.

BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is a potential tumor marker for several cancers,
including colorectal cancer (CRC), because of its heritable and stable
characteristics.
METHODS: Using a high-resolution, genome-wide approach, we epigenotyped
>450,000 CpG sites in tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from 23 microsatellite
instability (MSI)/microsatellite stability (MSS) CRC cases. Using matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, the methylation
status of five frequently hypermethylated genes were confirmed in 75 independent 
CRC series and 353 CRC patients with available plasma.
RESULTS: Compared with non-tumor tissues, 13 MSI tumors had 34,836 (7 %) aberrant
methylation sites, 87 % of which were hypermethylated. In contrast, only 9,806
(2 %) differentially methylated sites were identified in ten MSS cases (62 %
hypermethylated). In both MSI and MSS, 228 promoter-associated CpG islands were
hypermethylated, with AGBL4, ZNF625, MDFI, TWIST1, and FLI1 being most frequently
hypermethylated. In an independent set of 35 MSI and 40 MSS cases, the
methylation status of these five genes significantly differed between tumor and
adjacent non-tumor tissues. Of 353 CRC patients, 230 (65.2 %), 232 (65.7 %), and 
247 (70.0 %) had AGBL4, FLI1, and TWIST1 promoter hypermethylation in circulating
cell-free DNA, respectively. In patients without metastasis, the sensitivity of
any two or three hypermethylation markers was 52.8-57.8 and 27.9-38.9 %,
respectively. The sensitivity of any two or three markers was significantly high 
in patients with stage IV disease (73.0 and 55.6 %, respectively). The prognostic
value of these epimarkers was inconclusive.
CONCLUSION: DNA methylation patterns differed in CRC subtypes. The identified
hypermethylation markers in CRC patients may have good sensitivity in different
CRC stages.

Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) play important roles in skeletal
development and bone fracture healing, yet how PDGFs execute their functions
remains incompletely understood. Here we show that PDGF-AA, but not -AB or -BB,
could activate the BMP-Smad1/5/8 pathway in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which 
requires BMPRIA as well as PDGFRa. PDGF-AA promotes MSC osteogenic
differentiation through the BMP-Smad1/5/8-Runx2/Osx axis and MSC migration via
the BMP-Smad1/5/8-Twist1/Atf4 axis. Mechanistic studies show that PDGF-AA
activates BMP-Smad1/5/8 signaling by feedback down-regulating PDGFRa, which frees
BMPRI and allows for BMPRI-BMPRII complex formation to activate smad1/5/8, using 
BMP molecules in the microenvironment. This study unravels a physical and
functional interaction between PDGFRa and BMPRI, which plays an important role in
MSC differentiation and migration, and establishes a link between PDGF-AA and
BMPs pathways, two essential regulators of embryonic development and tissue
homeostasis.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from malignant diseases worldwide, with
the non-small cell (NSCLC) subtype accounting for the majority of cases. NSCLC is
characterized by frequent genomic imbalances and copy number variations (CNVs),
but the epigenetic aberrations that are associated with clinical prognosis and
therapeutic failure remain not completely identify. In the present study, a total
of 55 lung cancer patients were included and we conducted genomic and genetic
expression analyses, immunohistochemical protein detection, DNA methylation and
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to obtain genetic and epigenetic profiles
associated to prognosis and chemoresponse of NSCLC patients. Finally, siRNA
transfection-mediated genetic silencing and cisplatinum cellular cytotoxicity
assays in NSCLC cell lines A-427 and INER-37 were assessed to describe
chemoresistance mechanisms involved. Our results identified high frequencies of
CNVs (66-51% of cases) in the 7p22.3-p21.1 and 7p15.3-p15.2 cytogenetic regions. 
However, overexpression of genes, such as MEOX2, HDAC9, TWIST1 and AhR, at
7p21.2-p21.1 locus occurred despite the absence of CNVs and little changes in DNA
methylation. In contrast, the promoter sequences of MEOX2 and TWIST1 displayed
significantly lower/decrease in the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 and
increased in the active histone mark H3K4me3 levels. Finally these results
correlate with poor survival in NSCLC patients and cellular chemoresistance to
oncologic drugs in NSCLC cell lines in a MEOX2 and TWIST1 overexpression
dependent-manner. In conclusion, we report for the first time that MEOX2
participates in chemoresistance irrespective of high CNV, but it is significantly
dependent upon H3K27me3 enrichment probably associated with aggressiveness and
chemotherapy failure in NSCLC patients, however additional clinical studies must 
be performed to confirm our findings as new probable clinical markers in NSCLC
patients.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a critical role in the development 
of tumor metastases by enhancing migration/invasion. One of the hallmarks of EMT 
is loss of E-cadherin and gain of N-cadherin expression, which are regulated by
the core EMT-inducing transcription factors (EMT-TFs), such as Zeb1/2, Snai1/2
and Twist1. Here, we find that EMT-TFs can be dynamically degraded by an atypical
ubiquitin E3 ligase complex Skp1-Pam-Fbxo45 (SPFFbxo45) through the ubiquitin
proteasome system (UPS). The key step is recognition of EMT-TFs by Fbxo45 through
its SPRY domain for Zeb2, or F-box domain for the other three EMT-TFs Snai1,
Snai2 and Twist1, respectively. The K48-linkaged ubiquitination capability on
Zeb2 relies on its functional SBD domain. In addition, miR-27a* can directly
down-regulate the expression of Fbxo45, preventing degradation of EMT-TFs and
thus ensuring EMT phenotype. We suggest that Fbxo45 is a key node of the
miR-27a*/Fbxo45/EMT-TFs signaling axis.

TWIST1 silencing enhances in vitro and in vivo osteogenic differentiation of

signaling and TAZ upregulation.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) show promise for cellular therapy and regenerative 
medicine. Human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hASCs) represent an attractive
source of seed cells in bone regeneration. How to effectively improve osteogenic 
differentiation of hASCs in the bone tissue engineering has become a very
important question with profound translational implications. Numerous regulatory 
pathways dominate osteogenic differentiation of hASCs involving transcriptional
factors and signaling molecules. However, how these factors combine with each
other to regulate hASCs osteogenic differentiation still remains to be
illustrated. The highly conserved developmental proteins TWIST play key roles for
transcriptional regulation in mesenchymal cell lineages. This study investigates 
TWIST1 function in hASCs osteogenesis. Our results show that TWIST1 shRNA
silencing increased the osteogenic potential of hASCs in vitro and their skeletal
regenerative ability when applied in vivo. We demonstrate that the increased
osteogenic capacity observed with TWIST1 knockdown in hASCs is mediated through
endogenous activation of BMP and ERK/FGF signaling leading, in turn, to
upregulation of TAZ, a transcriptional modulator of MSCs differentiation along
the osteoblast lineage. Inhibition either of BMP or ERK/FGF signaling suppressed 
TAZ upregulation and the enhanced osteogenesis in shTWIST1 hASCs. Cosilencing of 
both TWIST1 and TAZ abrogated the effect elicited by TWIST1 knockdown thus,
identifying TAZ as a downstream mediator through which TWIST1 knockdown enhanced 
osteogenic differentiation in hASCs. Our functional study contributes to a better
knowledge of molecular mechanisms governing the osteogenic ability of hASCs, and 
highlights TWIST1 as a potential target to facilitate in vivo bone healing.

Differentiated embryo chondrocyte 2 (DEC2/Sharp-1/Bhlhe41), a basic
helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, has been shown to regulate the
transcription of target genes by binding to their E-box elements. We identified a
possible DEC2-response element (consensus E-box: CACGTG) in the promoter region
of Twist1. Forced expression of DEC2 significantly repressed Twist1 promoter
activity under normoxia and under hypoxia as assessed by a luciferase reporter
assay. In addition, over-expression of DEC2 repressed Twist1 mRNA expression
assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Site-directed mutagenesis studies showed 
that mutagenesis of the consensus E-box sequence eliminated the ability of DEC2
to reduce the Twist1 promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
assays confirmed that the DEC2-mediated repression is primarily achieved by
binding to the E-box in the Twist1 promoter. Knockdown of DEC2 by siRNA
significantly attenuated the repression of Twist1 expression. DEC2 and Twist1
exhibit inversed protein expression patterns during development of mouse tongue
embryo tissue. Given the fact that DEC2 protein is emerging as an important
regulator in a vast array of cellular events, including cell differentiation,
maturation of lymphocytes and the molecular clock, our study elucidates an
important mechanism by which DEC2 regulates cellular function by modulating the
expression of Twist1.

Arsenic is well established as a human carcinogen, but the molecular mechanisms
leading to arsenic-induced carcinogenesis are complex and elusive. It is not been
determined if the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to
carcinogen-induced malignant transformation and subsequent tumor formation. We
have found that, during the neoplastic transformation induced in human bronchial 
epithelial (HBE) cells by a low concentration (1.0µM) of arsenite, the cells
undergo an EMT and show enhanced invasion and migration. With longer times for
transformation of HBE cells, there was increased miR-21 expression. Further,
during the transformation of HBE cells, inhibition of miR-21 with an miR-21
inhibitor increased levels of PDCD4, an inhibitor of neoplastic transformation;
reduced Twist1, a transcription factor involved in cell differentiation; and
inhibited cell invasion and migration. In addition, PDCD4 interacted with Twist1 
and inhibited its expression function, which is involved in arsenite-induced EMT.
Thus, miR-21, acting on PDCD4, which interacts with Twist1 and represses the
expression of Twist1, contributes to the EMT induced by arsenite. These
observations add to an understanding of the processes involved in
arsenite-induced carcinogenesis.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) facilitates tumor metastasis. Twist is
a basic helix-loop-helix protein that modulates many target genes through
E-box-responsive elements. There are two twist-like proteins, Twist-1 and
Twist-2, sharing high structural homology in mammals. Twist-1 was found to be a
key factor in the promotion of metastasis of cancer cells, and is known to induce
EMT. Twist-1 participation in carcinoma progression and metastasis has been
reported in a variety of tumors. However, controversy exists concerning the
correlation between Twist-1 and prognostic value with respect to carcinoma. A
systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to determine whether the
expression of Twist-1 was associated with the prognosis of carcinoma patients.
This analysis included 17 studies: four studies evaluated lung cancer, three
evaluated head and neck cancer, two evaluated breast cancer, two evaluated
esophageal cancer, two evaluated liver cancer and one each evaluated
osteosarcoma, bladder, cervical and ovarian cancer. A total of 2006 patients were
enrolled in these studies, and the median trial sample size was 118 patients.
Twist-1 expression was associated with worse overall survival (OS) at both 3
years (hazard ratio "HR" for death = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.86 to 2.45, p < 0.001) and 
5 years (HR for death = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.76 to 2.29, p < 0.001). Expression of
Twist-1 is associated with worse survival in carcinoma.

MicroRNAs are key players in most biological processes. Some microRNAs are
involved in the genesis of tumors and are therefore termed oncomiRs, while
others, termed metastamiRs, play a significant role in the formation of cancer
metastases. Previously, we identified ten different cellular microRNAs that
downregulate the expression of MICB, a ligand of the activating NK receptor
NKG2D. Interestingly, several of the ten MICB-targeting microRNAs, such as
miR-10b, are involved in tumor formation and metastasis. In this work, we
identify a complex interplay between these different microRNAs. Specifically, we 
demonstrate that three of the MICB-targeting microRNAs: miR-20a, miR-17-5p and
miR-93, also target the same site in the 3'UTR of TWIST1, a transcription factor 
implicated in cancer metastasis. Additionally, we show that miR-520d-5p targets a
different site in the 3'UTR of TWIST1. We next show that the miR-520d-5p-mediated
decrease of TWIST1 expression results in reduced expression of one of its
targets, miR-10b, and in the restoration of E-Cadherin expression, which in turn 
results in reduced cellular motility and invasiveness. Finally, we show that
miR-520d-5p leads to reduced proliferation of tumor cells, and that high levels
of miR-520d-5p correlate with higher survival rates of cancer patients.

PURPOSE: Pathological neovessel formation impacts many blinding vascular eye
diseases. Identification of molecular signatures distinguishing pathological
neovascularization from normal quiescent vessels is critical for developing new
interventions. Twist-related protein 1 (TWIST1) is a transcription factor
important in tumor and pulmonary angiogenesis. This study investigated the
potential role of TWIST1 in modulating pathological ocular angiogenesis in mice.
METHODS: Twist1 expression and localization were analyzed in a mouse model of
oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). Pathological ocular angiogenesis in Tie2-driven
conditional Twist1 knockout mice were evaluated in both OIR and laser-induced
choroidal neovascularization models. In addition, the effects of TWIST1 on
angiogenesis and endothelial cell function were analyzed in sprouting assays of
aortic rings and choroidal explants isolated from Twist1 knockout mice, and in
human retinal microvascular endothelial cells treated with TWIST1 small
interfering RNA (siRNA).
RESULTS: TWIST1 is highly enriched in pathological neovessels in OIR retinas.
Conditional Tie2-driven depletion of Twist1 significantly suppressed pathological
neovessels in OIR without impacting developmental retinal angiogenesis. In a
laser-induced choroidal neovascularization model, Twist1 deficiency also resulted
in significantly smaller lesions with decreased vascular leakage. In addition,
loss of Twist1 significantly decreased vascular sprouting in both aortic ring and
choroid explants. Knockdown of TWIST1 in endothelial cells led to dampened
expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and
decreased endothelial cell proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that TWIST1 is a novel regulator of pathologic
ocular angiogenesis and may represent a new molecular target for developing
potential therapeutic treatments to suppress pathological neovascularization in
vascular eye diseases.

OBJECTIVES: The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial process in
tumorigenesis that enables tumor cells to invade and metastasize. The
transcription factors SIP1, SLUG, ZEB1, SNAI1, and TWIST are fundamental in
regulating EMT. We investigated the relationships between several
clinicopathological variables, prognosis, and SIP1, SLUG, or ZEB1 in a
retrospective pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) cohort.
STUDY DESIGN: Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expression of SIP1,
SLUG, and ZEB1 in 108 tumor samples from a retrospective cohort of patients with 
PSCC.
RESULTS: Tumors with positive epithelial SIP1 immunostaining were more advanced
(SIII-IV, p=0.02) and had more lymph node metastases (p=0.04) than SIP1-negative 
tumors. Tumors with positive stromal staining of SIP1 relapsed more often than
SIP1-negative tumors (p=0.007). Negative SIP1 immunoreactivity correlated
significantly with better disease-specific survival (DSS) and better overall
survival (OS) (p=0.012 and p=0.003 for epithelial reactivity, p=0.018 and p=0.003
for stromal reactivity, respectively). Lack of epithelial SIP1 expression
remained an independent and favorable prognostic factor in a Cox proportional
hazards model (p=0.046), together with high Karnofsky performance status score
and low T class (p<0.001 for both). Co-expression of SNAI1, TWIST, and SIP1 in
tumor epithelium predicted even shorter DSS than SIP1 expression alone (p<0.001) 
in the present study cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: SIP1 is related to cancer progression and appears to be an
independent prognostic factor in PSCC.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, and most patients have
localized disease at the time of diagnosis. However, 4% already present with
metastatic disease. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition is a fundamental process in
carcinogenesis that has been shown to be involved in prostate cancer progression.
The main event in epithelial-mesenchymal transition is the repression of
E-cadherin by transcription factors, but the process is also regulated by
microRNAs. The aim of this study was to analyze gene and microRNA expression
involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition in localized prostate cancer and
metastatic prostate cancer cell lines and correlate with clinicopathological
findings. We studied 51 fresh frozen tissue samples from patients with localized 
prostate cancer (PCa) treated by radical prostatectomy and three metastatic
prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, DU145, PC3). The expression of 10 genes and 18
miRNAs were assessed by real-time PCR. The patients were divided into groups
according to Gleason score, pathological stage, preoperative PSA, biochemical
recurrence, and risk group for correlation with clinicopathological findings. The
majority of localized PCa cases showed an epithelial phenotype, with
overexpression of E-cadherin and underexpression of the mesenchymal markers.
MiRNA-200 family members and miRNAs 203, 205, 183, 373, and 21 were
overexpressed, while miRNAs 9, 495, 29b, and 1 were underexpressed.
Low-expression levels of miRNAs 200b, 30a, and 1 were significantly associated
with pathological stage. Lower expression of miR-200b was also associated with a 
Gleason score = 8 and shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival. Furthermore, 
low-expression levels of miR-30a and high-expression levels of Vimentin and
Twist1 were observed in the high-risk group. Compared with the primary tumor, the
metastatic cell lines showed significantly higher expression levels of miR-183
and Twist1. In summary, miRNAs 200b, 30a, 1, and 183 and the genes Twist1 and
Vimentin might play important roles in the progression of prostate cancer and may
eventually become important prognostic markers.

To explore HER2 expression in Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric carcinoma
(EBVaGC) and the possible mechanisms causing down-regulation of HER2 expression
in EBVaGC, we first evaluated HER2 and LMP2A expression on a
clinicopathological-features matched cohort including 78 EBVaGC and 216
EBV-negative gastric carcinoma (EBVnGC) cases by immunohistochemistry. Cases with
high HER2 expression in EBVaGC were significantly less than in EBVnGC (5.1%
versus 23.7%; p<0.001), and none of the 34 LMP2A+ EBVaGC showed high HER2
expression. Further, overexpressing LMP2A in EBV-negative SGC7901 cells
significantly decreased HER2, TWIST and YB-1 mRNA by 36.1%±8.1%, 87.6%±14.0% and 
83.8%±5.7%, and protein by 44%, 57% and 49%, respectively. Additionally, the
nucleus/cytoplasm ratios of TWIST and YB-1 were also decreased by 85% and 80%,
respectively. Silencing LMP2A by siRNA in EBV-positive SNU719 cells for 48 h
significantly increased HER2, TWIST and YB-1 mRNA to 276.7%±14.6%, 1284.8%±38.2% 
and 332.0%±15.5% and protein to 212%, 457% and 232%, respectively. The
nucleus/cytoplasm ratios of TWIST and YB-1 were up-regulated by 4.00- and
3.57-fold, respectively, following LMP2A down-regulation. Moreover,
LMP2A+/HER2low EBVaGC cases presented the best overall survival compared with
LMP2A-/HER2low and LMP2A-/HER2high cases (p=0.003, log-rank test). These results 
suggest that LMP2A may suppress the HER2 expression through the TWIST/YB-1 axis
in EBVaGC.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent genome-wide association studies identified the
histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) gene region as a major risk locus for large-vessel 
stroke and coronary artery disease. However, the mechanisms linking variants at
this locus to vascular risk are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated
the candidacy and directionality of HDAC9 in atherosclerosis and analyzed
associations between risk alleles at 7p21.1 and plaque characteristics.
METHODS: Allele-dependent expression of HDAC9 was analyzed in human peripheral
blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors. Effects of HDAC9 deficiency on
atherosclerotic plaques were investigated in 18- and 28-week-old ApoE(-/-) mice
by histology and immunohistochemistry. We further performed detailed plaque
phenotyping and genotyping of rs2107595, the lead single-nucleotide polymorphism 
for large-vessel stroke, in carotid endarterectomy samples of 1858 subjects from 
the Athero-Express study.
RESULTS: Gene expression studies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed
increased mRNA levels of HDAC9 but not of neighboring genes (TWIST1/FERD3L) in
risk allele carriers of rs2107595. Compared with HDAC9(+/+)ApoE(-/-) mice,
HDAC9(-/-)ApoE(-/-) mice exhibited markedly reduced lesion sizes throughout
atherosclerotic aortas and significantly less advanced lesions. The proportion of
Mac3-positive macrophages was higher in plaques from HDAC9(-/-)ApoE(-/-) mice,
but this was largely because of a lower proportion of advanced lesions. Analysis 
of human atherosclerotic plaques revealed no association between rs2107595 and
specific plaque characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that HDAC9 represents the disease-relevant gene 
at the stroke and coronary artery disease risk locus on 7p21.1, and that risk
alleles in this region mediate their effects through increased HDAC9 expression. 
Targeted inhibition of HDAC9 might be a viable strategy to prevent
atherosclerosis.

BACKGROUND: Iloprost, a stable prostacyclin I2 analogue, seems to have an
osteoblast-protective potential, whereas indomethacin suppresses new bone
formation. The aim of this study was to investigate human bone marrow stromal
cell (BMSC) proliferation and differentiation towards the osteoblastic lineage by
administration of indomethacin and/or iloprost.
MATERIAL/METHODS: Human bone marrow cells were obtained from 3 different donors
(A=26 yrs/m; B=25 yrs/f, C=35 yrs/m) via vacuum aspiration of the iliac crest
followed by density gradient centrifugation and flow cytometry with defined
antigens (CD105+/73+/45-/14-). The cells were seeded and incubated as follows:
without additives (Group 0; donor A/B/C), with 10(-7) M iloprost only (Group
0+ilo; A/B), with indomethacin only in concentrations of 10(-6) M (Group 1, A),
10(-5) M (Group 2, B), 10(-4) M (Group 3, A/B), and together with 10(-7) M
iloprost (Groups 4-6, A/B/C). On Day 10 and 28, UV/Vis spectrometric and
immunocytochemical assays (4 samples per group and donor) were performed to
investigate cell proliferation (cell count measurement) and differentiation
towards the osteoblastic lineage (CD34-, CD45-, CD105+, type 1 collagen (Col1),
osteocalcin (OC), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Runx2, Twist, specific
ALP-activity).
RESULTS: Indomethacin alone suppressed BMSC differentiation towards the
osteoblastic lineage by downregulation of Runx2, Col1, and ALP. In combination
with indomethacin, iloprost increased cell proliferation and differentiation and 
it completely suppressed Twist expression at Day 10 and 28. Iloprost alone did
not promote cell proliferation, but moderately enhanced Runx2 and Twist
expression. However, the proliferative effects and the specific ALP-activity
varied donor-dependently.
CONCLUSIONS: Iloprost partially antagonized the suppressing effects of
indomethacin on BMSC differentiation towards the osteoblast lineage. It enhanced 
the expression of Runx2 and, only in the presence of indomethacin, it completely 
suppressed Twist. Thus, in the treatment of avascular osteonecrosis or painful
bone marrow edema, the undesirable effects of indomethacin might be
counterbalanced by iloprost.

Accumulating evidence suggests that ß-catenin signaling may be involved in oral
tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) cell invasion. Abnormal activation of
twist-related protein 1 (TWIST1 or TWIST) has been identified in several types of
human cancer. A recent study showed that overexpression of TWIST is associated
with a poor prognosis in patients with OTSCC and may enhance OTSCC cell invasion.
This study investigated the effect of TWIST on ß-catenin signaling in OTSCC cells
and its impact on OSTCC cell invasion. Stable overexpression of TWIST, with or
without knockdown of ß-catenin, and stable knockdown of TWIST were performed in
SCC-4 and TCA8113 human OTSCC cells. Overexpression of TWIST in SCC-4 and TCA8113
cells increased ß-catenin signaling luciferase reporter activity, mRNA levels of 
the ß-catenin signaling target genes, c-Myc and c-Jun levels, soluble ß-catenin
level, the phosphorylation status of glycogen synthase kinase-3ß (GSK-3ß) at
serine 9, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression and cell invasion.
Knockdown of TWIST had the opposite effect. All of these changes, with the
exception of phosphorylation of GSK-3ß, were eliminated by stable knockdown of
ß-catenin. In addition, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor,
LY294002 abrogated the enhancing effects of TWIST on mRNA levels of c-Myc and
c-Jun, soluble ß-catenin levels, MMP-2 expression, cell invasion and GSK-3ß
phosphorylation. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that TWIST
enhances cell invasion and MMP-2 expression in OTSCC cells through ß-catenin
signaling, probably via a PI3K-dependent mechanism. This study provides novel
insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying OTSCC progression.

Breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1) is downregulated in non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC), and its reduction correlates with disease progression.
Herein, we investigate the mechanisms through which loss of the BRMS1 gene
contributes to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Using a short hairpin 
RNA (shRNA) system, we show that loss of BRMS1 promotes basal and transforming
growth factor beta-induced EMT in NSCLC cells. NSCLC cells expressing BRMS1
shRNAs (BRMS1 knockdown [BRMS1(KD)]) display mesenchymal characteristics,
including enhanced cell migration and differential regulation of the EMT markers.
Mesenchymal phenotypes observed in BRMS1(KD) cells are dependent on RelA/p65, the
transcriptionally active subunit of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-<U+03BA>B). In addition, 
chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates that loss of BRMS1 increases 
Twist1 promoter occupancy of RelA/p65 K310-a key histone modification associated 
with increased transcription. Knockdown of Twist1 results in reversal of
BRMS1(KD)-mediated EMT phenotypic changes. Moreover, in our animal model,
BRMS1(KD)/Twist1(KD) double knockdown cells were less efficient in establishing
lung tumors than BRMS1(KD) cells. Collectively, this study demonstrates that loss
of BRMS1 promotes malignant phenotypes that are dependent on NF-<U+03BA>B-dependent
regulation of Twist1. These observations offer fresh insight into the mechanisms 
through which BRMS1 regulates the development of metastases in NSCLC.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are key contributors to malignant
progression, but their critical regulators remain largely unknown. In this study,
we examined the role of Twist1, a central regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal
transition in carcinoma cells, in the transdifferentiation of normal quiescent
fibroblasts to CAF and we defined its upstream controls and downstream effectors.
Primary human gastric fibroblast and CAF cultures were established from
gastrectomy specimens and validated as nontumor cells by somatic mutation
analyses. In these cultures, exposure to the proinflammatory cytokine IL6
commonly expressed in tumors was sufficient to induce Twist1 expression in normal
fibroblasts and transdifferentiate them into CAFs via STAT3 phosphorylation. In
xenograft models, tumor infiltration of Twist1-expressing CAFs was enhanced
strongly by ectopic IL6 expression in gastric or breast cancer cells. We found
that Twist1 expression was necessary and sufficient for CAF transdifferentiation.
Enforced expression of Twist1 in normal fibroblasts was also sufficient to drive 
CAF marker expression and malignant character in gastric cancer cells both in
vitro and in vivo. Conversely, silencing the expression of Twist1 in CAFs
abrogated their tumor-promoting properties. Downstream of Twist1, we defined the 
chemokine CXCL12 as a transcriptional target. Clinically, CXCL12 and Twist1
expression were correlated in CAFs present in gastric tumor specimens. Finally,
ectopic expression of Twist1 in normal fibroblasts suppressed premature
senescence, whereas Twist1 attenuation accelerated senescence in CAFs. Our
findings define Twist1 as a compelling target to deprogram the tumor-supporting
features of the cancer microenvironment.

Cardio-miRNAs and onco-miRNAs: circulating miRNA-based diagnostics for
non-cancerous and cancerous diseases.

Katoh M(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Omics Network, National Cancer Center Tokyo, Japan.

Cardiovascular diseases and cancers are the leading causes of morbidity and
mortality in the world. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that
primarily repress target mRNAs. Here, miR-24, miR-125b, miR-195, and miR-214 were
selected as representative cardio-miRs that are upregulated in human heart
failure. To bridge the gap between miRNA studies in cardiology and oncology, the 
targets and functions of these miRNAs in cardiovascular diseases and cancers will
be reviewed. ACVR1B, BCL2, BIM, eNOS, FGFR3, JPH2, MEN1, MYC, p16, and ST7L are
miR-24 targets that have been experimentally validated in human cells. ARID3B,
BAK1, BCL2, BMPR1B, ERBB2, FGFR2, IL6R, MUC1, SITR7, Smoothened, STAT3, TET2, and
TP53 are representative miR-125b targets. ACVR2A, BCL2, CCND1, E2F3, GLUT3, MYB, 
RAF1, VEGF, WEE1, and WNT7A are representative miR-195 targets. BCL2L2,
ß-catenin, BIM, CADM1, EZH2, FGFR1, NRAS, PTEN, TP53, and TWIST1 are
representative miR-214 targets. miR-125b is a good cardio-miR that protects
cardiomyocytes; miR-195 is a bad cardio-miR that elicits cardiomyopathy and heart
failure; miR-24 and miR-214 are bi-functional cardio-miRs. By contrast, miR-24,
miR-125b, miR-195, and miR-214 function as oncogenic or tumor suppressor miRNAs
in a cancer (sub)type-dependent manner. Circulating miR-24 is elevated in
diabetes, breast cancer and lung cancer. Circulating miR-195 is elevated in acute
myocardial infarction, breast cancer, prostate cancer and colorectal adenoma.
Circulating miR-125b and miR-214 are elevated in some cancers. Cardio-miRs and
onco-miRs bear some similarities in functions and circulation profiles. miRNAs
regulate WNT, FGF, Hedgehog and other signaling cascades that are involved in
orchestration of embryogenesis and homeostasis as well as pathogenesis of human
diseases. Because circulating miRNA profiles are modulated by genetic and
environmental factors and are dysregulated by genetic and epigenetic alterations 
in somatic cells, circulating miRNA association studies (CMASs) within several
thousands of cases each for common non-cancerous diseases and major cancers are
necessary for miRNA-based diagnostics.

BACKGROUND: Interleukin 6 (IL-6)-mediated signal transducers and activators of
transcription 3 (STAT-3) phosphorylation (activation) is aberrantly sustained in 
cholangiocarcinoma cells resulting in enhanced myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1)
expression and resistance to apoptosis. FTY720, a new immunosuppressant, derived 
from ISP-1, has been studied for its putative anti-cancer properties. This study 
aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which FTY720 mediates antitumor effects in
cholangiocarcinoma (CC) cells.
METHODS: Three CC cell lines were examined, QBC939, TFK-1, and HuCCT1. The
therapeutic effects of FTY720 were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Cell
proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, invasive potential, and epithelial-
mesenchy-mal transition (EMT) were examined.
RESULTS: FTY720 greatly inhibited CC cells proliferation and EMT in vitro and in 
vivo, and this effect was associated with dephosphorylation of STAT3tyr705.
FTY720 induced apoptosis and G1 phase arrest in CC cells, and inhibited invasion 
of CC cells. Western blot analysis showed that FTY720 induced cleavage of
caspases 3, 8 and 9, and of PARP, in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with a
substantial decrease in p-STAT3, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, survivin, cyclin D1, cyclin E,
N-cadherin, vimentin, VEGF and TWIST1. In vivo studies showed that tumor growth
and metastasis were significantly suppressed after FTY720 treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that FTY720 induces a significant decrease in 
p-STAT3, which inhibits proliferation and EMT of CC cells, and then induces G1
phase arrest and apoptosis. We have characterized a novel immunosuppressant,
which shows potential anti-tumor effects on CC via p-STAT3 inhibition. FTY720
merits further investigation and warrants clinical evaluation.

The pattern of secreted factors in the tumor microenvironment has been shown to
initiate tumor epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT); however, little is known 
about their interplay undergoing this phenotypic switch. In this study, we
revealed obvious coactions of cytokine IL-6 and chemokine CCL2 during EMT
induction. We found that IL-6 effectively induced EMT and promoted tumor cell
invasion, which could be markedly enhanced by addition of CCL2 in a
CCR2-dependent manner. IL-6 and CCL2 induced each other and cooperatively
elicited STAT3 phosphorylation; conversely, STAT3 regulated the production of
IL-6 and CCL2, thus constituting a positive feedback loop to maintain and amplify
STAT3 signaling, consequently promoting additional EMT events. Furthermore, CCL2 
greatly enhanced IL-6-induced EMT events mainly by upregulating the expression of
Twist. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 disrupted STAT3-centered
loop and markedly suppressed Twist expression as well as IL-6/CCL2-mediated EMT
induction. Thus, our findings highlighted the synergy of the two secreted factors
of tumor microenvironment, in regulating transformed properties of non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC).

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the levels of matrix
metalloproteinases (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and Twist in tumor tissue and serum from 46
cases of breast cancer patients and 31 cases of benign breast diseases patients
by immunohistochemical staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,
respectively. The association of gelatinase and Twist expression with
clinicopathological factors was also analyzed in the present study.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The studied population consisted of 46 breast cancer
patients and 31 benign breast disease patients. Serum concentrations of MMP-2,
MMP-9 and Twist were measured by using human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
The protein expression of Twist, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were determined by
immunohistochemical.
RESULTS: The results show that the levels of MMP-2, MMP-9 and Twist expression
were significantly increased in tissue and serum from breast cancer group,
compared to the group of benign breast lesions diseases (p < 0.05). The
pre-operative serum levels of MMP-2, MMP-9 and Twist were positively correlated
with their expression in breast cancer tissues, respectively (p < 0.05). We,
then, correlated serum and tissue levels of MMP-2, MMP-9 and Twist in breast
cancer samples with patients' clinicopathologic characteristics. Compared to low 
expression, high serum and tissue levels of MMP-2 and Twist were associated with 
lymph node metastasis and higher TNM stage, high tissue MMP-9 levels were
associated with lymph node metastasis and higher TNM stage, and high serum MMP-9 
levels were associated with c-erbB-2 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that serum levels of MMP-2, MMP-9 and Twist could
be as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and predicting metastasis of breast
cancer.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-limited vesicles secreted by normal and
malignant cells and their function is dependent on the cargo they carry and the
cell type from which they originate. Moreover, EVs mediate many stages of tumor
progression including angiogenesis, escape from immune surveillance and
extracellular matrix degradation. Linoleic acid (LA) is an essential
polyunsaturated fatty acid that induces expression of plasminogen activator
inhibitor-1, proliferation, migration and invasion in breast cancer cells.
However the role of secreted EVs from MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated with LA like
mediator of the epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) process in mammary
non-tumorigenic epithelial cells MCF10A remains to be studied. In the present
study, we demonstrate that treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells for 48 h with 90 µM LA
does not induce an increase in the number of secreted EVs. In addition, EVs
isolated from supernatants of MDA-MB-231 stimulated for 48 h with 90 µM LA induce
a transient down-regulation of E-cadherin expression, and an increase of Snail1
and 2, Twist1 and 2, Sip1, vimentin and N-cadherin expression in MCF10A cells.
EVs also promote an increase of MMP-2 and -9 secretions, an increase of NF<U+03BA>B-DNA 
binding activity, migration and invasion in MCF10A cells. In summary, our
findings demonstrate, for the first time, that EVs isolated from supernatants of 
MDA-MB-231 stimulated for 48 h with 90 µM LA induce an EMT-like process in MCF10A
cells.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression level of TWIST1 in
B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (BNHL) and its association with the
clinicopathological characteristics of BNHL. Expression levels of TWIST1 were
analyzed in patients with BNHL (n=45) and lymphadenosis (n=21) using
immunohistochemical staining and western blot analysis. In addition, the mRNA
expression levels of TWIST1 in the peripheral blood were detected by fluorescent 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The positive rate of TWIST1 expression in
the BNHL tissue was 82.2%, which was significantly higher compared with the
lymphadenosis tissue (5%; P<0.05). In addition, the protein expression level of
TWIST1 in the BNHL tissue was higher compared with the lymphadenosis tissue.
TWIST1 expression was also higher in stage III/IV BNHL tissues than in stage I/II
tissues (P<0.05). The tissues were staged following the Ann Arbor system.
Furthermore, the mRNA expression level of TWIST1 in the peripheral blood of the
BNHL tissue (3.03±0.03) was higher compared with the lymphadenosis tissue, and
the mRNA expression level of TWIST1 was higher in stage III/IV (4.41±0.12)
tissues than in stage I/II BNHL (2.03±0.08) tissues. In conclusion, TWIST1
expression was higher in the tissue and peripheral blood of patients with BNHL
when compared with those with lymphadenosis. Thus, TWIST1 expression was
associated with the clinicopathological stage of BNHL.

Craniosynostosis, caused by the premature fusion of one or more of the cranial
sutures, can be classified into non-syndromic or syndromic and by which sutures
are affected. Clinical assignment is a difficult challenge due to the high
phenotypic variability observed between syndromes. During routine diagnostics, we
screened 182 Spanish craniosynostosis probands, implementing a four-tiered
cascade screening of FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR1, TWIST1 and EFNB1. A total of 43
variants, eight novel, were identified in 113 (62%) patients: 104 (92%) detected 
in level 1; eight (7%) in level 2 and one (1%) in level 3. We subsequently
screened additional genes in the probands with no detected mutation: one
duplication of the IHH regulatory region was identified in a patient with
craniosynostosis Philadelphia type and five variants, four novel, were identified
in the recently described TCF12, in probands with coronal or multisuture
affectation. In the 19 Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS) individuals in whom a
variant was detected, 15 (79%) carried a TWIST1 variant, whereas four (21%) had a
TCF12 variant. Thus, we propose that TCF12 screening should be included for
TWIST1 negative SCS patients and in patients where the coronal suture is
affected. In summary, a molecular diagnosis was obtained in a total of 119/182
patients (65%), allowing the correct craniosynostosis syndrome classification,
aiding genetic counselling and in some cases provided a better planning on how
and when surgical intervention should take place and, subsequently the
appropriate clinical follow up.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that catalyze the removal of acetyl from
lysine residues in histones and other proteins, which results in gene
transcriptional repression and subsequent changes in signaling events. HDACs
inhibitors (HDACIs) have been used to reverse the aberrant epigenetic changes
associated with cancer. However, the effects of HDACIs on epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) in human cancer cells remain unclear. EMT is a fundamental
process governing morphogenesis in multicellular organisms and promotes cancer
invasion and metastasis. In this study, human cancer cells were treated with the 
HDACI trichostatin A (TSA). TSA was found to induce mesenchymal-like
morphological changes in BGC-823 human gastric cancer and MCF-7 breast cancer
cells, and increase the expression levels of the mesenchymal markers Vimentin and
Twist. However, the expression levels of the epithelial cell marker E-cadherin
were also increased in response to TSA treatment, while cell migration was
reduced by TSA. Furthermore, TSA decreased cancer cell colony formation in
BGC-823 and MCF-7 cells, and led to the deregulation of ß-catenin, a critical
signaling molecule involved in EMT. In conclusion, the results suggested that TSA
exhibits dual functions in EMT induction and inhibition in human cancer cells,
but the detailed mechanisms require further investigation.

BACKGROUND: Metastasis accounts for the most deaths in patients with
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B
ligand (RANKL) is associated with cancer metastasis, while its role in HCC
remains largely unknown.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine the expression of RANK
in HCC tissue (n<U+200A>=<U+200A>398). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR) and Western blot were used to examine the expression of RANK,
E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, Snail, Slug, Twist and MMPs in HCC cells. Wound
healing and Transwell assays were used to evaluate cell migration and invasion
ability.
RESULTS: We found that expression of RANK, the receptor of RANKL, was
significantly higher in HCC tumor tissues than in peritumor liver tissues
(p<0.001). Constitutive expression of RANK was detected in HCC cell lines, which 
can be up-regulated when HCC cells were stimulated with RANKL. Notably, in vitro 
experiments showed that activation of RANKL-RANK axis significantly promoted
migration and invasion ability of HCC cells. In addition, RANKL stimulation
increased the expression levels of N-cadherin, Snail, and Twist, while decreased 
the expression of E-cadherin, with concomitant activation of NF-<U+03BA>B signaling
pathway. Moreover, administration of the NF-<U+03BA>B inhibitor attenuated RANKL-induced
migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of HCC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: RANKL could potentiate migration and invasion ability of
RANK-positive HCC cells through NF-<U+03BA>B pathway-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal
transition, which means that RANKL-RANK axis could be a potential target for HCC 
therapy.

The silent Twist gene may increase the sensitivity of cervical cancer cells
chemotherapy to paclitaxel, thus was a new idea to improve the efficacy of cancer
chemotherapy. The aim was to explore chemotherapy sensitivity of silent Twist
gene increased cervical cancer cells to paclitaxel through study the
proliferation and apoptosis of cervical cancer Twist gene after paclitaxel
treatment. Cervical carcinoma Caski cells and Hela cells was cultured in vitro,
mRNA gene expression was detected by using semi-quantitative, fluorescence
quantitative PCR, and transferred to Caski cells transiently, and affected with
paclitaxel solution of five kinds of different concentrations of 0.001, 0.01,
0.1, 1, 10 umol/L respectively. Then the results of <0.05). Every 12h after 36 h,
the expression inhibition rate in two groups of Caski cells that has transfected 
this study was Twist gene expression in Caski cells was higher than in Hela
cells, which was of significant difference (p siRNA1 and siRNA2 were 20.3%,
38.2%, 33%, 24%, 68.6%, 50.8% respectively. After 48 h in five different
concentrations of paclitaxel effect, the cell growth inhibition rate of group
siRNA2 with the best transfection efficiency was obviously higher than that of
negative control group and blank control group, and the growth inhibition rates
showed concentration dependence (p<0.05). It can be concluded that Twist gene in 
Caski cell was of high expression and the silent Twist gene could inhibit Caski
cell proliferation and promote its apoptosis, thus to improve the chemotherapy
sensitivity of Caski cells.

Genome-wide Twist1 occupancy in endocardial cushion cells, embryonic limb buds,
and peripheral nerve sheath tumor cells.

Author information:

Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio 45229, USA. Katherine.Yutzey@cchmc.org.

BACKGROUND: The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist1 has
well-documented roles in progenitor populations of the developing embryo,
including endocardial cushions (ECC) and limb buds, and also in cancer. Whether
Twist1 regulates the same transcriptional targets in different tissue types is
largely unknown.
RESULTS: The tissue-specificity of Twist1 genomic occupancy was examined in mouse
ECCs, limb buds, and peripheral nerve sheath tumor (PNST) cells using chromatin
immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (Chip-seq) analysis. Consistent with
known Twist1 functions during development and in cancer cells, Twist1-DNA binding
regions associated with genes related to cell migration and adhesion were
detected in all three tissues. However, the vast majority of Twist1 binding
regions were specific to individual tissue types. Thus, while Twist1 has similar 
functions in ECCs, limb buds, and PNST cells, the specific genomic sequences
occupied by Twist1 were different depending on cellular context. Subgroups of
shared genes, also predominantly related to cell adhesion and migration, were
identified in pairwise comparisons of ECC, limb buds and PNST cells. Twist1
genomic occupancy was detected for six binding regions in all tissue types, and
Twist1-binding sequences associated with Chst11, Litaf, Ror2, and Spata5 also
bound the potential Twist1 cofactor RREB1. Pathway analysis of the genes
associated with Twist1 binding suggests that Twist1 may regulate genes associated
with the Wnt signaling pathway in ECCs and limb buds.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data indicate that Twist1 interacts with genes that 
regulate adhesion and migration in different tissues, potentially through
distinct sets of target genes. In addition, there is a small subset of genes
occupied by Twist1 in all three tissues that may represent a core group of Twist1
target genes in multiple cell types.

BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate
post-transcriptional mRNA expression by binding to 3' untranslated region
(3'-UTR) of the complementary mRNA sequence resulting in translational repression
and gene silencing. They act as negative regulators of gene expression and play a
pivotal role in regulating apoptosis and cell proliferation. Studies have shown
that miRNAs interact with p53 by regulating the activity and function of p53
through direct repression or its regulators. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
is an evolutionary conserved check point protein kinase that plays a major effect
in the control of cell division via protein synthesis regulation. mTOR regulates 
protein synthesis through phosphorylation and inactivation of 4E-BP1 and through 
phosphorylation and activation of S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). These two downstream
effectors of mTOR control cell growth and metabolism. In mammals, mTOR protein
kinase is the central node in the nutrient and growth factor signaling and p53
plays a critical role in sensing genotoxic stress. Activation of p53 inhibits
mTOR activity, which in turn regulates its downstream targets providing a cross
talk among both the signaling machinery. MicroRNA-15 and 16 belong to a common
precursor family and are highly conserved. Deletion or downregulation of these
two microRNAs has been shown to accelerate cell division by modulating the
expression of the genes involved in controlling cell cycle progression. These
microRNAs may function as tumor suppressors and act on the downstream targets of 
p53 signaling pathway. To have a better insight of the role of miR-15/16 in
regulating the cross talk of p53 and mTOR, we performed an in depth study in
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by performing a gain-of-function analysis with
lentiviral plasmids expressing microRNA-15 and 16.
METHODS: The effect of individual microRNAs on RPS6KB1 was examined by using
3'-UTR clones via luciferase based assays. The cell cycle effects were observed
by flow-cytometric analysis. Reverse transcription PCR was used to explore the
expression of mTOR and RPS6KB1 in cells transfected with miR-15/16.
RESULTS: Overexpression of miR-15/16 led to inhibition of cell proliferation
causing G1 cell cycle arrest as well as caspase-3 dependent apoptosis. Forced
expression of miR-15/16 might lead to decrease in mRNA level of RPS6KB1, mTOR.
The effect was a complete reversal after treatment with anti-miRs against
miR-15/16 proving the specificity of the expression. In addition, the dual
luciferase reporter assays indicated a clear decrease in luciferase gene
expression in cells transfected with lentiviral based miR-15 and 16 plasmids
indicating that miR-15/16 directly targets RPS6KB1 through its 3'-UTR binding.
Further, these microRNAs also inhibit epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) 
by targeting key proteins such as Twist1 and EZH2 clearly demonstrating its
crucial role in controlling cell proliferation.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that exogenous microRNA-15/16 can target RPS6KB1,
control cell proliferation and cause apoptosis in caspase-dependent manner even
in the absence of functional p53.

Heart- and neural crest derivatives-expressed (Hand) proteins belong to the Twist
family of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, and play
crucial roles in the development of several organs. They form heterodimers with
Twist1 via their HLH domain. Disruption of the expression balance between Hand2
and Twist1 causes limb malformation, indicating that the expression level of
Hand2 relative to Twist1 is essential for limb development. Mutations of the
TWIST1 and TWIST2 genes are involved in human diseases. Although, the functions
of the Hand proteins are indispensable for limb, heart, and craniofacial
development, mutations of the Hand genes that are causative of human diseases
remain elusive. Recently, comparative analyses of a human chromosomal disorder,
partial trisomy distal 4q, and its mouse model, which is a spontaneously
occurring mutant, clearly demonstrated that over dosage of Hand2 results in
developmental defects of limbs, craniofacial, and lumbar vertebrae, and that
trisomy of the Hand2 gene directly causes a human congenital disorder. In this
review, we focus on gene dosage effect of Hand2 in limb, heart, and craniofacial 
development, and discuss its implication in human diseases.

The transcription factor TWIST1 is a highly evolutionally conserved basic
Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factor that functions as a master regulator
of gastrulation and mesodermal development. Although TWIST1 was initially
associated with embryo development, an increasing number of studies have shown
TWIST1 role in the regulation of tissue homeostasis, primarily as a regulator of 
inflammation. More recently, TWIST1 has been found to be involved in the process 
of tumor metastasis through the regulation of Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition
(EMT). The objective of this review is to examine the normal functions of TWIST1 
and its role in tumor development, with a particular focus on ovarian cancer. We 
discuss the potential role of TWIST1 in the context of ovarian cancer stem cells 
and its influence in the process of tumor formation.

Wnt signaling and ciliogenesis are core features of embryonic development in a
range of metazoans. Chibby (Cby), a basal-body associated protein, regulates
ß-catenin-mediated Wnt signaling in the mouse but not Drosophila. Here we present
an analysis of Cby's embryonic expression and morphant phenotypes in Xenopus
laevis. Cby RNA is supplied maternally, negatively regulated by Snail2 but not
Twist1, preferentially expressed in the neuroectoderm, and regulates
ß-catenin-mediated gene expression. Reducing Cby levels reduced the density of
multiciliated cells, the number of basal bodies per multiciliated cell, and the
numbers of neural tube primary cilia; it also led to abnormal development of the 
neural crest, central nervous system, and pronephros, all defects that were
rescued by a Cby-GFP chimera. Reduction of Cby led to an increase in Wnt8a and
decreases in Gli2, Gli3, and Shh RNA levels. Many, but not all, morphant
phenotypes were significantly reversed by the Wnt inhibitor SFRP2. These
observations extend our understanding of Cby's role in mediating the network of
interactions between ciliogenesis, signaling systems and tissue patterning.

Autocrine activation of the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway occurs in several cancers,
notably in breast tumors, and is associated with higher expression of various Wnt
ligands. Using various inhibitors of the FZD/LRP receptor complex, we demonstrate
that some adenosquamous carcinomas that develop in MMTV-CUX1 transgenic mice
represent a model for autocrine activation of the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway. By
comparing expression profiles of laser-capture microdissected mammary tumors, we 
identify Glis1 as a transcription factor that is highly expressed in the subset
of tumors with elevated Wnt gene expression. Analysis of human cancer datasets
confirms that elevated WNT gene expression is associated with high levels of CUX1
and GLIS1 and correlates with genes of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) signature: VIM, SNAI1 and TWIST1 are elevated whereas CDH1 and OCLN are
decreased. Co-expression experiments demonstrate that CUX1 and GLIS1 cooperate to
stimulate TCF/ß-catenin transcriptional activity and to enhance cell migration
and invasion. Altogether, these results provide additional evidence for the role 
of GLIS1 in reprogramming gene expression and suggest a hierarchical model for
transcriptional regulation of the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway and the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

Both circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
play an important role in invasion, migration and chemoresistant in tumor
development. This study aimed to detect whether EMT occurred in human gastric
CTCs and to explore the mechanism of EMT in human gastric CTCs. We analysed
epithelial markers (pan-CK, E-cadherin), mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin,
vimentin) EMT related miR-200s, and Akt in gastric CTCs. The impact of miR-200s
on EMT, migration and invasion in CTCs was tested. We found that epithelial
markers pan-CK, E-cadherin were decreased, and mesenchymal markers N-cadherin,
vimentin were overexpressed in gastric CTCs. Expression of EMT related
transcriptors, snail1, zeb1, twist1, were reversely correlated with miR-200s, and
were positively correlated with phospho-Akt. Upregulated of miR-200s
downregulated twist1 and zeb1 mRNA expression, and resulted in the supression of 
EMT, and impaired migration and invasion in gastric CTCs. Inhibition of p-Akt led
to upregulation of miR-200s. In conclusion, gastric CTCs exhibited remarkable EMT
process, and p-Akt/miR-200s signaling regulates EMT, migration and invasion in
gastric CTCs.

BACKGROUND: Hypoxia induced by antiangiogenic agents is linked to the generation 
of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and treatment failure through unknown mechanisms. The
generation of endothelial cell-independent microcirculation in malignant tumors
is defined as tumor cell vasculogenic mimicry (VM). In the present study, we
analyzed the effects of an antiangiogenic agent on VM in triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC).
METHODS: Microcirculation patterns were detected in patients with TNBC and
non-TNBC. Tientsin Albino 2 (TA2) mice engrafted with mouse TNBC cells and nude
mice engrafted with human breast cancer cell lines with TNBC or non-TNBC
phenotypes were administered sunitinib and analyzed to determine tumor
progression, survival, microcirculation, and oxygen concentration. Further, we
evaluated the effects of hypoxia induced with CoCl2 and the expression levels of 
the transcription factor Twist1, in the presence or absence of a Twist siRNA, on 
the population of CD133(+) cells and VM in TNBC and non-TNBC cells.
RESULTS: VM was detected in 35.8 and 17.8% of patients with TNBC or with
non-TNBC, respectively. The growth of tumors in TNBC and non-TNBC-bearing mice
was inhibited by sunitinib. The tumors in TA2 mice engrafted with mouse TNBCs and
in mice engrafted a human TNBC cell line (MDA-MB-231) regrew after terminating
sunitinib administration. However, this effect was not observed in mice engrafted
with a non-TNBC tumor cell line. Tumor metastases in sunitinib-treated TA2 mice
was accelerated, and the survival of these mice decreased when sunitinib was
withdrawn. VM was the major component of the microcirculation in
sunitinib-treated mice with TNBC tumors, and the population of CD133+ cells
increased in hypoxic areas. Hypoxia also induced MDA-MB-231 cells to express
Twist1, and CD133(+) cells present in the MDA-MB-231 cell population induced VM
after reoxygenation. Moreover, hypoxia did not induce MDA-MB-231 cells
transfected with an sh-Twist1 siRNA cell to form VM and generate CD133(+) cells. 
Conversely, hypoxia induced MCF-7 cells transfected with Twist to form VM and
generate CD133+ cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Sunitinib induced hypoxia in TNBCs, and Twist1 expression induced by
hypoxia accelerated VM by increasing population of CD133(+) cells. VM was
responsible for the regrowth of TNBCs sunitinib administration was terminated.

expression in non-small cell lung cancer.

SIRT6 is a member of the NAD(+)-dependent class III deacetylase sirtuin family.
Current studies have revealed that SIRT6 plays important roles in the epigenetic 
regulation of genes expression and contribute to the proliferation,
differentiation and apoptosis of cancer cells. However, the biological function
of SIRT6 in lung cancer has not been elucidated. The present study showed that
the mRNA and protein levels of SIRT6 were decreased in human non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) tissues and cell lines. MTT assay showed that overexpression of
SIRT6 could inhibit the proliferation in NSCLC cells. In contrast, SIRT6
knockdown using small interfering RNA promoted NSCLC cells proliferation. On the 
molecular level, we found that SIRT6 inhibited the expression of Twist1 both at
the mRNA and protein levels in NSCLC cells. Taken together, these results
demonstrated for the first time that SIRT6 suppressed NSCLC cells proliferation
via down-regulation of Twist1 expression and might provide novel therapeutic
targets in the treatment of lung cancer.

Fibroblast phenotypes in different lung diseases.

Du H, Chen D, Zhou Y, Han Z, Che G.

BACKGROUND: The "seed and soil" hypothesis emphasizes the importance of
interactions between tumor cells and their microenvironment. CAFs (Cancer
associated fibroblasts) are important components of the tumor microenvironment.
They were widely involved in cancer cells growth and metastasis. Fibroblasts may 
also play a role in inflammatory disease. The phenotype conversion of fibroblasts
in lung diseases has not been investigated previously. We hypothesized that
fibroblasts phenotypes may vary among different types of lung disease.
METHODS: The study included six types of lung tissues, ranging from normal lung
to lung adenocarcinoma with lymphatic metastasis. Para-carcinoma tissues which
were 2-cm-away from the tumor focus were also included in the analysis. The
expression of target proteins including alpha-SMA (smooth muscle actin), FAP
(fibroblast activation protein), vimentin, E-cadherin, and CK-19 (cytokeratin-19)
were examined by immunohistochemistry. TGF-beta(transforming growth factor) and
Twist were detected simultaneously in all samples.
RESULTS: A progressive increase in the levels of alpha-SMA, vimentin and CK-19
was observed in correlation to the degree of malignancy from normal lung tissue
to lung adenocarcinoma with lymphatic metastasis, whereas E-cadherin expression
showed the opposite trend. TGF-beta and Twist were detected in cancer tissues and
inflammatory pseudotumors. None of the proteins were detected in para-carcinoma
tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: Fibroblast phenotypes varied according to the type and degree of
lung malignancy and fibroblasts phenotypic conversion occurs as a gradual process
with specific spatiotemporal characteristics. Similar fibroblast phenotypes in
inflammatory diseases and cancer tissues suggested a correlation between
inflammation and cancer and implied a common mechanism underlying the formation
of fibroblasts in inflammatory diseases and lung cancer.

metastatic breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: The detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in peripheral blood
(PB) of patients with breast cancer predicts poor clinical outcome. Cancer cells 
with stemness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) features display
enhanced malignant and metastatic potential. A new methodology was developed in
order to investigate the co-expression of a stemness and an EMT marker (ALDH1 and
TWIST, respectively) on single CTCs of patients with early and metastatic breast 
cancer.
METHODS: Triple immunofluorescence using anti-pancytokeratin (A45-B/B3),
anti-ALDH1 and anti-TWIST antibodies was performed in cytospins prepared from
hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells and SKBR-3, MCF-7 and MDA.MB.231 breast
cancer cell lines. Evaluation of ALDH1 expression levels (high, low or absent)
and TWIST subcellular localization (nuclear, cytoplasmic or absent) was performed
using the ARIOL system. Cytospins prepared from peripheral blood of patients with
early (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>80) and metastatic (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>50) breast cancer were analyzed for CTC
detection (based on pan-cytokeratin expression and cytomorphological criteria)
and characterized according to ALDH1 and TWIST.
RESULTS: CTCs were detected in 13 (16%) and 25 (50%) patients with early and
metastatic disease, respectively. High ALDH1 expression (ALDH1high) and nuclear
TWIST localization (TWISTnuc) on CTCs was confirmed in more patients with
metastatic than early breast cancer (80% vs. 30.8%, respectively; p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.009). In 
early disease, ALDH1low/neg CTCs (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.006) and TWISTcyt/neg CTCs (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.040)
were mainly observed. Regarding co-expression of these markers,
ALDH1high/TWISTnuc CTCs were more frequently evident in the metastatic setting
(76% vs. 15.4% of patients, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001; 61.5% vs. 12.9% of total CTCs), whereas in
early disease ALDH1low/neg/TWISTcyt/neg CTCs were mainly detected (61.5% vs. 20% 
of patients, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.078; 41.9% vs. 7.7% of total CTCs).
CONCLUSIONS: A new assay is provided for the evaluation of ALDH1 and TWIST
co-expression at the single CTC-level in patients with breast cancer. A
differential expression pattern for these markers was observed both in early and 
metastatic disease. CTCs expressing high ALDH1, along with nuclear TWIST were
more frequently detected in patients with metastatic breast cancer, suggesting
that these cells may prevail during disease progression.

OBJECTIVES: The characteristics of cell populations extracted from oral mucosal
non-epithelial tissues and their ability to differentiate were evaluated in vitro
as a potential source of cells for mandibular and corneal regeneration.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Oral mucosal non-epithelial cells (OMNECs) were extracted 
from tissue samples and were studied by flow cytometry and RT-PCR. Cells
differentiating into osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, neurocytes, or
keratocytes were characterized by RT-PCR and cell staining.
RESULTS: OMNECs expressed CD44, CD90, CD105, CD166, and STRO-1 antigens, which
are markers for mesenchymal stem cells. In addition, Oct3/4, c-Myc, Nanog, KLF4, 
and Rex, which are expressed by embryonic or pluripotent stem cells, were
detected by RT-PCR. Expression of CD49d, CD56, and PDGFRa, proteins closely
associated with the neural crest, was observed in OMNECs, as was expression of
Twist1, Sox9, Snail1 and Snail2, which are early neural crest and neural markers.
Specific differentiation markers were expressed in OMNECs after differentiation
into osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, or keratocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: Populations of OMNECs may contain both mesenchymal stem cells and
neural crest origin cells and are a potential cell source for autologous
regeneration of mandibular or corneal stroma.

BACKGROUND: Along with de novo resistance, continued exposure to trastuzumab, an 
anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) antibody, can lead to
acquired resistance. In this study, we characterize a new anti-HER2/neu antibody 
resistant and metastatic mouse breast carcinoma cell line, TUBO-P2J. This cell
line was developed during in vivo experiments using the antibody sensitive and
non-metastatic tumor line TUBO. In addition, TUBO-P2J was used to establish an
intratumoral HER2 heterogenous animal tumor model to evaluate the therapeutic
effects of anti-HER2/neu antibody.
METHODS: After establishing the cell line, TUBO-P2J was characterized regarding
its susceptibility to anti-neu antibody and chemotherapeutics, as well as its
metastatic potential in vitro and in vivo. In addition, expression profiles of
metastasis related genes were also evaluated. A clinically relevant intratumoral 
HER2 heterogenous tumor model was established by inoculating mice with tumor
cells consisting of TUBO and TUBO-P2J at a ratio of 1,000:1 or 10,000:1. Tumor
growth and mouse survival were used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of
anti-neu antibody.
RESULTS: The TUBO-P2J cell line is a HER2/neu negative and highly metastatic
variant of TUBO. This cell line was resistant to anti-neu antibody therapy, and
when inoculated subcutaneously, metastasized to the lungs within 14 days.
Compared to the parental TUBO cell line, TUBO-P2J displayed an
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related gene expression profile
including: the loss of E-cadherin, and increased Vimentin, Snail, and Twist1
expression. In addition, TUBO-P2J exhibited increased invasion and migration
activity, and was resistant to chemotherapy drugs. Finally, mixed tumor
implantations experiments revealed that an increased percentage of TUBO-P2J
rendered tumors less responsive to anti-neu antibody therapy.
CONCLUSION: This study describes a novel model of intratumoral heterogenous
metastatic breast cancer in immune competent mice that can be used to develop
novel or combined immunotherapies to overcome antibody resistance.

The ethanolic extract of bark from Salix aegyptiaca L. inhibits the metastatic
potential and epithelial to mesenchymal transition of colon cancer cell lines.

Enayat S(1), Banerjee S.

Willow bark extracts have been used for centuries as a natural pain killer.
Recently their potential as anticancer agents has been reported. We have shown
the high antioxidant activity, phenolic and flavonoid content in the ethanolic
extract of bark (EEB) from Salix aegyptiaca, a species endogenous to the Middle
East. We have also reported that incubation with EEB resulted in a reduction in
cell proliferation through the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest via
the inhibition of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase/Protein kinase B and mitogen
activated protein kinases signaling pathways as strongly as commercial
inhibitors. The current study demonstrates the robust inhibition of
anchorage-independent growth, motility, migration, and adhesion of colon cancer
cell lines HCT-116 and HT-29 by EEB. These in vitro functional changes were
accompanied by a restoration of E-cadherin expression, a reduction in EGFR,
SNAI1, SNAI2, and Twist1 and the matrix metalloproteases MMP9 and MMP2. Many of
these proteins are involved in the process of epithelial to mesenchymal
transition, which is considered as a critical step in the progression of
noninvasive tumor cells into malignant, metastatic carcinomas. We therefore
propose that EEB from Salix aegyptiaca is a potent nutraceutical causing cancer
chemoprevention by inhibiting epithelial to mesenchymal transition and can be
consumed for its health promoting effects.

The mechanisms controlling tumour-induced angiogenesis are presently not clear.
In principle, angiogenesis can be achieved through the activation of endothelial 
cells in existing vessels or by transdifferentiation of tumour cells into
endothelial cells. However, whether tumour cells can go through a prior
epithelial-mesenchymal transition and further differentiate into endothelial
cells remains unknown. Here we show that overexpression of Twist1, a
transcriptional regulator that induces and promotes cancer metastasis, leads to
endothelial differentiation in head and neck cancer (HNC) cells. Induction of
Jagged1 expression by Twist1 is essential for Twist1-induced endothelial
differentiation. The Jagged1/Notch signalling subsequently activates KLF4,
inducing stem-like properties in HNC cells and conferring them with drug
resistance. Our results indicate that the Twist1-Jagged1/KLF4 axis is essential
both for transdifferentiation of tumour cells into endothelial cells and for
chemoresistance acquisition.

Helicobacter pylori, a Gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium found in the
stomach, is assumed to be associated with carcinogenesis, invasion and metastasis
in digestive diseases. Cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) is an oncogenic protein
of H. pylori that is encoded by a Cag pathogenicity island related to the
development of gastric cancer. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the
main biological event in invasion or metastasis of epithelial cells. H. pylori
may promote EMT in human gastric cancer cell lines, but the specific mechanisms
are still obscure. We explored the underlying molecular mechanism of EMT induced 
by H. pylori CagA in gastric cancer. In our article, we detected gastric cancer
specimens and adjacent non-cancerous specimens by immunohistochemistry and found 
increased expression of the EMT-related regulatory protein TWIST1 and the
mesenchymal marker vimentin in cancer tissues, while programmed cell death factor
4 (PDCD4) and the epithelial marker E-cadherin expression decreased in cancer
specimens. These changes were associated with degree of tissue malignancy. In
addition, PDCD4 and TWIST1 levels were related. In gastric cancer cells
cocultured with CagA expression plasmid, CagA activated TWIST1 and vimentin
expression, and inhibited E-cadherin expression by downregulating PDCD4. CagA
also promoted mobility of gastric cancer cells by regulating PDCD4. Thus, H.
pylori CagA induced EMT in gastric cancer cells, which reveals a new signaling
pathway of EMT in gastric cancer cell lines.

The impact of microRNA-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling on epithelial-mesenchymal
transition and cancer stemness in endometrial cancer.

Activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, a common mechanism in all subtypes of
endometrial cancers (endometrioid and non-endometrioid tumors), has important
roles in contributing to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem 
cell (CSC) features. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that
concurrently affect multiple target genes, and regulate a wide range of genes
involved in modulating EMT and CSC properties. Here we overview the recent
advances revealing the impact of miRNAs on EMT and CSC phenotypes in tumors
including endometrial cancer via regulating PI3K/AKT pathway. MiRNAs are crucial 
mediators of EMT and CSC through targeting PTEN-PI3K-AKT-mTOR axis. In
endometrial cancer cells, miRNAs can activate or attenuate EMT and CSC by
targeting PTEN and other EMT-associated genes, such as Twist1, ZEB1 and BMI-1.
More detailed studies of miRNAs will deepen our understanding of the molecular
basis underlying PI3K/AKT-induced endometrial cancer initiation and progression. 
Targeting key signaling components of PI3K/AKT pathway by restoring or inhibiting
miRNA function holds promise as a potential therapeutic approach to suppress EMT 
and CSC in endometrial cancer.

Ovarian cancer presents therapeutic challenges due to its typically late
detection, aggressive metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. The transcription
factor Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) has been implicated in human cancers as a
tumor suppressor or oncogene, although its role depends greatly on the cellular
context. The role of KLF4 in ovarian cancer has not been elucidated in
mechanistic detail. In this study, we investigated the role of KLF4 in ovarian
cancer cells by transducing the ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3 and OVCAR3 with a
doxycycline-inducible KLF4 lentiviral vector. Overexpression of KLF4 reduced cell
proliferation, migration, and invasion. The epithelial cell marker gene
E-cadherin was significantly upregulated, whereas the mesenchymal cell marker
genes vimentin, twist1 and snail2 (slug) were downregulated in both
KLF4-expressing SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells. KLF4 inhibited the transforming growth
factor ß (TGFß)-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ovarian
cancer cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that KLF4 functions as a tumor
suppressor gene in ovarian cancer cells by inhibiting TGFß-induced EMT.

BACKGROUND: Twist 1 is highly expressed in adipose tissue and has been associated
with obesity and related disorders. However, the molecular function of Twist 1 in
adipose tissue is unclear. Twist 1 has been implicated in cell lineage
determination and differentiation. Therefore, we investigated both the role of
Twist 1 in adipocyte precursor mobilization and the relationship of Twist 1 with 
other molecular determinants of adipocyte differentiation.
METHODS: We examined Twist 1 mRNA and protein expression in subcutaneous adipose 
tissues from diet-induced obese C57/BL6 mice and Wistar rats and in obese
patients undergoing liposuction or adipose transplant surgeries. Twist 1
expression was measured on days 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 of 3T3-L1 differentiation in
vitro. The role of Twist 1 in adipogenesis was explored using retroviral
interference of Twist 1 expression. Adipokine secretion was evaluated using a
RayBio® Biotin Label-based Adipokine Array.
RESULTS: Twist 1 mRNA and protein levels were reduced in diet-induced obese mice 
and rats and in obese humans. Twist 1 was upregulated during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte 
differentiation in vitro, beginning from the fourth day of differentiation
induction. Retroviral interference of Twist 1 expression did not significantly
impair lipid formation; however, retroviral interference induced PPAR<U+03B3> mRNA and
protein expression on day 4 of differentiation induction. Adipokine array
analyses revealed increased secretion of CXCR4 (19.55-fold), VEGFR1 (92.13-fold),
L-21 R (63.55-fold), and IL-12 R beta 1 (59.66-fold) and decreased secretion of
VEGFR3 (0.01-fold), TSLP R (0.071-fold), MIP-1 gamma (0.069-fold), TNF
RI/TNFRSF1A (0.09-fold), and MFG-E8 (0.06-fold).
CONCLUSIONS: Twist 1 is a regulator of adipocyte gene expression although it is
not likely to regulate differentiation. We identified PPAR<U+03B3> as a potential target
of Twist 1 and found variation in the secretion of multiple adipokines, which
might indicate a prospective mechanism linking Twist 1 expression with obesity or
associated diseases.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Aberrant hypermethylation of cancer-related genes has emerged
as a promising strategy for the development of diagnostic, prognostic and
predictive biomarkers in human cancer, including colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim
of this study was to perform a systematic and comprehensive analysis of a panel
of CRC-specific genes as potential diagnostic, prognostic and predictive
biomarkers in a large, population-based CRC cohort.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Methylation status of the SEPT9, TWIST1, IGFBP3, GAS7, ALX4
and miR137 genes was studied by quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing in a
population-based cohort of 425 CRC patients.
RESULTS: Methylation levels of all genes analyzed were significantly higher in
tumor tissues compared to normal mucosa (p<0.0001); however, cancer-associated
hypermethylation was most frequently observed for miR137 (86.7%) and IGFBP3 (83%)
in CRC patients. Methylation analysis using the combination of these two genes
demonstrated greatest accuracy for the identification of colonic tumors
(sensitivity 95.5%; specificity 90.5%). Low levels of IGFBP3 promoter methylation
emerged as an independent risk factor for predicting poor disease free survival
in stage II and III CRC patients (HR<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.49, 95% CI: 0.28-0.85, p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.01). Our
results also suggest that stage II & III CRC patients with high levels of IGFBP3 
methylation do not benefit from adjuvant 5FU-based chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: By analyzing a large, population-based CRC cohort, we demonstrate the
potential clinical significance of miR137 and IGFBP3 hypermethylation as
promising diagnostic biomarkers in CRC. Our data also revealed that IGFBP3
hypermethylation may serve as an independent prognostic and predictive biomarker 
in stage II and III CRC patients.

Autophagy deficiency stabilizes TWIST1 to promote epithelial-mesenchymal
transition.

Chicago, IL USA.

The transcription factor TWIST1 is a basic helix-loop-helix protein that
regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in early embryonic
morphogenesis, cancer development, and cancer metastasis. The regulation of
TWIST1 remains poorly understood. Recently, we found that autophagy deficiency
stabilizes TWIST1 protein through SQSTM1/p62 accumulation. SQSTM1 binds with
TWIST1 to inhibit TWIST1 degradation in both autophagosomes and proteasomes.
SQSTM1-mediated TWIST1 stabilization promotes EMT in vitro, and tumor growth and 
metastasis in mice. We propose autophagy as a new mechanism to control the TWIST1
protein levels and activity in cancer development and progression.

Therapy-resistant cancer cells are a major problem in cancer research. Recent
studies suggest that the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key
mechanism in therapy resistance. Yet, the expressions of EMT markers, EMT core
regulators, and a stem cell marker of BMI1 during chemotherapy have been poorly
analyzed in clinical breast cancer specimens. In the present study, we
investigated the roles of RhoC under chemotherapy to follow up on earlier
findings demonstrating the involvement of RhoC in prostate cancer resistance to
endocrine therapy. Immunohistochemically, E-cadherin expression was significantly
lower in human breast cancer specimens analyzed after chemotherapy than specimens
biopsied before chemotherapy. Significant upregulation of fibronectin, a
mesenchymal EMT marker, was found in post-chemotherapy analysis. A study of the
EMT core regulators of SNAIL1, SNAIL2, TWIST1, and a well-known stem cell marker 
of BMI1 revealed no post-chemotherapy upregulation of these molecules. In
contrast, RhoC expression was significantly upregulated in post-chemotherapy
breast cancer specimens. MCF-7 cells stably transfected with the constitutive
active (CA) RhoC plasmid manifested a reduced level of E-cadherin at the
peripheries and disorganization of actin fibers, with no accompanying
upregulation of SNAIL1, SNAIL2, TWIST1, or BMI1 in Western blots. Exposure of
etoposide on MCF-7 cells showed RhoC upregulation together with reduced
membranous expression of E-cadherin and disorganization of actin fibers. In MTT
assay, however, the CA-RhoC-expressing MCF-7 cells failed to show chemotherapy
resistance under etoposide treatment. Taken in sum, RhoC may contribute to an
EMT-like process in human breast cancer during chemotherapy.

Prenatal diagnosis of craniosynostosis (compound Saethre-Chotzen syndrome
phenotype) caused by a de novo complex chromosomal rearrangement (1; 4; 7) with a
microdeletion of 7p21.3-7p15.3, including TWIST1 gene--a case report.

Massalska D, Bijok J, Kucinska-Chahwan A, Jamsheer A, Bogdanowicz J, Jakiel G,
Roszkowski T.

Craniosynostosis (a premature fusion of the cranial sutures) occurs with a
frequency of 1 in 2100-2500 births and in over 40% cases is caused by known
genetic factors--either single gene mutations or chromosomal rearrangements.
Cases caused by complex chromosomal abnormalities are uncommon and likely
associated with compound phenotype. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS) [#101400] is
caused by TWIST1 gene haploinsufficiency. Its phenotype includes uni- or
bicoronal synostosis, short stature, facial dysmorphism and variable anomalies of
the hands and feet. Due to its poor sonographic manifestation a prenatal
diagnosis of SCS is challenging. We report a case of a prenatally detected
craniosynostosis (compound Saethre-Chotzen syndrome phenotype) caused by a de
novo complex chromosomal rearrangement (1; 4; 7) with a microdeletion of
7p21.3-7p15.3, including TWIST1 gene.

Most NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations benefit from treatment with EGFR-TKIs,
but the clinical efficacy of EGFR-TKIs is limited by the appearance of drug
resistance. Multiple kinase inhibitors of EGFR family proteins such as afatinib
have been newly developed to overcome such drug resistance. We established
afatinib-resistant cell lines after chronic exposure of activating EGFR
mutation-positive PC9 cells to afatinib. Afatinib-resistant cells showed
following specific characteristics as compared to PC9: [1] Expression of EGFR
family proteins and their phosphorylated molecules was markedly downregulated by 
selection of afatinib resistance; [2] Expression of FGFR1 and its ligand FGF2 was
alternatively upregulated; [3] Treatment with anti-FGF2 neutralizing antibody
blocked enhanced phosphorylation of FGFR in resistant clone; [4] Both resistant
clones showed collateral sensitivity to PD173074, a small-molecule FGFR-TKIs, and
treatment with either PD173074 or FGFR siRNA exacerbated suppression of both
afatinib-resistant Akt and Erk phosphorylation when combined with afatinib; [5]
Expression of twist was markedly augmented in resistant sublines, and twist
knockdown specifically suppressed FGFR expression and cell survival. Together,
enhanced expression of FGFR1 and FGF2 thus plays as an escape mechanism for cell 
survival of afatinib-resistant cancer cells, that may compensate the loss of
EGFR-driven signaling pathway.

Twist-1, a novel regulator of hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and myeloid
lineage development.

Transcription factor Twist-1 plays essential roles in specification and
differentiation of mesoderm-derived tissues. Growing evidences now link Twist-1
to the acquisition of stem-cell-like properties. However, the role of Twist-1 in 
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) remains largely uncharacterized. We report that
Twist-1 is more highly expressed in murine HSC and its expression declines with
differentiation. To investigate Twist-1 gene function, retroviral-mediated
overexpression or removal experiments are performed. Competitive repopulation
studies demonstrate that enforced expression of Twist-1 in HSC-enriched Lin(-)
c-Kit(+) Sca-1(+) (LKS) cells results in an increase in the size of the G(0)
population, and in their reconstitution ability after the first and a second
transplantation. Conversely, removal of Twist-1 in LKS cells impairs their
ability to repopulate. In addition, increased Twist-1 expression causes a shift
toward production of myeloid cells. Twist-1 transduction in LKS cells activates
myeloid lineage-determining factors PU.1 and GATA-1 and downregulates lymphoid
factor GATA-3 in vitro, suggesting that Twist-1-mediated myeloid skewing occurs
in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). These findings indicate that 
Twist-1 is not only involved in the maintenance of HSC dormancy and self-renewal 
capacity but also implicated in the myeloid lineage fate choice of HSPCs.
Exploration of the underlying mechanisms reveals that Runx1/c-Mpl/Tie2 regulatory
pathway could possibly account for the observed effects caused by Twist-1
overexpression. Our study provides the first evidence supporting a role for
Twist-1 in hematopoiesis.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with characteristics of
breast cancer stem cells, including chemoresistance and radioresistance. However,
it is unclear whether EMT itself or specific EMT regulators play causal roles in 
these properties. Here we identify an EMT-inducing transcription factor, zinc
finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), as a regulator of radiosensitivity and
DNA damage response. Radioresistant subpopulations of breast cancer cells derived
from ionizing radiation exhibit hyperactivation of the kinase ATM and
upregulation of ZEB1, and the latter promotes tumour cell radioresistance in
vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ATM phosphorylates and stabilizes ZEB1 in
response to DNA damage, ZEB1 in turn directly interacts with USP7 and enhances
its ability to deubiquitylate and stabilize CHK1, thereby promoting homologous
recombination-dependent DNA repair and resistance to radiation. These findings
identify ZEB1 as an ATM substrate linking ATM to CHK1 and the mechanism
underlying the association between EMT and radioresistance.

The cancer stem cell (CSC) model suggests that a small subpopulation of cancer
cells possesses the ability to self-renew and give rise to malignant progeny that
drive cancer progression. Recent reports have also proposed the existence of
certain extra- or intracellular signals that allow cancer progenitors to
dynamically revert to a stem cell state. However, the mechanisms underlying
cancer cell plasticity and CSC expansion are not entirely clear. Our previous
studies using a hyaluronan synthase 2 (Has2) transgenic mouse model demonstrated 
that hyaluronan overproduction caused rapid development of aggressive breast
carcinoma at a high incidence. Thus, we hypothesize that hyaluronan
overproduction may accelerate cancer progression by expanding CSC subpopulations 
during cancer development. Primary cancer cells were established from mammary
tumors developed in the transgenic mice and subjected to the Hoechst 33342 dye
exclusion assay to sort side population (SP) from non-side population (non-SP)
cells. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated the enrichment of
CD44(high)/CD24(low) CSC-like cells in the SP fraction of
hyaluronan-overproducing cancer cells. This subpopulation exhibited several
characteristics that were similar to CSCs, including cancer-initiating and
mammosphere-forming abilities. Excess hyaluronan production drove the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process defined as the loss of epithelial
phenotypes, up-regulation of transforming growth factor ß (TGF-ß), and induction 
of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-related transcriptional factors Snail
and Twist. Inhibition of TGF-ß-Snail signaling or silencing of Twist expression
abrogated the entrance into a stem cell state. Taken together, our findings
suggest that hyaluronan overproduction allows plastic cancer cell populations to 
revert to stem cell states via Twist and the TGF-ß-Snail signaling axis.

Adipose tissue dysfunction may be a central factor in the pathogenesis of insulin
resistance in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Gene expression in
subcutaneous adipose tissue in PCOS and its relation to metabolic and endocrine
features of the syndrome have been fragmentarily investigated. The aim was to
assess in subcutaneous adipose tissue the expression of genes potentially
associated with adipose tissue dysfunction and to explore their relation to
features of the syndrome. Twenty-one women with PCOS (body mass index [BMI]
18.2-33.4 kg/m(2)) and 21 controls (BMI 19.2-31.7 kg/m(2)) were matched pair-wise
for age, body weight, and BMI. Tissue biopsies were obtained to measure mRNA
expression of 44 genes (TaqMan Low Density Array). Differential expression levels
were correlated with BMI, glucose infusion rate (GIR), sex hormone binding
globulin (SHBG), and sex steroids. In PCOS, expression of adiponectin receptor 2 
(ADIPOR2), LPL, and twist-related protein 1 (TWIST1) was decreased, while
expression of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and heme oxygenase (decycling
1) (HMOX1) was increased. TWIST1 and HMOX1, both novel adipokines, correlated
with BMI and GIR. After BMI adjustment, LPL and ADIPOR2 expression correlated
with plasma estradiol, and CCL2 expression correlated with GIR, in all women. We 
conclude that adipose tissue mRNA expression differed in PCOS women and controls 
and that two novel adipokines, TWIST1 and HMOX1, together with adiponectin, LPL, 
and CCL2, and their downstream pathways merit further investigation.

The neural crest is a multipotent, highly migratory cell population that gives
rise to diverse cell types, including melanocytes. Factors regulating the
development of the neural crest and emigration of its cells are likely to
influence melanoma metastasis. The transcription factor FOXD3 plays an essential 
role in premigratory neural crest development and has been implicated in melanoma
cell dormancy and response to therapeutics. FOXD3 is downregulated during the
migration of the melanocyte lineage from the neural crest, and our previous work 
supports a role for FOXD3 in suppressing melanoma cell migration and invasion.
Alternatively, TWIST1 is known to have promigratory and proinvasive roles in a
number of cancers, including melanoma. Using ChIP-seq analysis, TWIST1 was
identified as a potential transcriptional target of FOXD3. Mechanistically, FOXD3
directly binds to regions of the TWIST1 gene locus, leading to transcriptional
repression of TWIST1 in human mutant BRAF melanoma cells. In addition, depletion 
of endogenous FOXD3 promotes upregulation of TWIST1 transcripts and protein.
Finally, FOXD3 expression leads to a significant decrease in cell migration that 
can be efficiently reversed by the overexpression of TWIST1. These findings
uncover the novel interplay between FOXD3 and TWIST1, which is likely to be
important in the melanoma metastatic cascade.IMPLICATIONS: FOXD3 and TWIST1
define distinct subgroups of cells within a heterogeneous tumor.

Transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase (Pol) II is essential for gene
expression during cell growth and differentiation. The positive transcription
elongation factor b (P-TEFb) stimulates transcriptional elongation by
phosphorylating Pol II and antagonizing negative elongation factors. A reservoir 
of P-TEFb is sequestered in the inactive 7SK snRNP where 7SK snRNA and the
La-related protein LARP7 are required for the integrity of this complex. Here, we
show that P-TEFb activity is important for the epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
(EMT) and breast cancer progression. Decreased levels of LARP7 and 7SK snRNA
redistribute P-TEFb to the transcriptionally active super elongation complex,
resulting in P-TEFb activation and increased transcription of EMT transcription
factors, including Slug, FOXC2, ZEB2, and Twist1, to promote breast cancer EMT,
invasion, and metastasis. Our data provide the first demonstration that the
transcription elongation machinery plays a key role in promoting breast cancer
progression by directly controlling the expression of upstream EMT regulators.

In this study we examine the consequences of altering Hand1 phosphoregulation in 
the developing neural crest cells (NCCs) of mice. Whereas Hand1 deletion in NCCs 
reveals a nonessential role for Hand1 in craniofacial development and embryonic
survival, altering Hand1 phosphoregulation, and consequently Hand1 dimerization
affinities, in NCCs results in severe mid-facial clefting and neonatal death.
Hand1 phosphorylation mutants exhibit a non-cell-autonomous increase in
pharyngeal arch cell death accompanied by alterations in Fgf8 and Shh pathway
expression. Together, our data indicate that the extreme distal pharyngeal arch
expression domain of Hand1 defines a novel bHLH-dependent activity, and that
disruption of established Hand1 dimer phosphoregulation within this domain
disrupts normal craniofacial patterning.

The development of esophageal squamous carcinomas (ESC) results from numerous
genetic alterations. Our previous study demonstrated that p63 is highly expressed
in human ESC cells and stimulates their growth; however, the mechanism by which
p63 regulates ESC cell adhesion and invasion remains unclear. In the present
study, we further elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms by which p63
regulates metastasis in ESC cells. Knockdown of p63 significantly diminished the 
invasion of ESC cell lines TE-8 and TE-12, whereas overexpression of p63
significantly increased the migration rates of BE3 and OE33 cells. The mRNA and
protein levels of vimentin, twist, SUSD2, and uPA were significantly decreased in
p63-knockdown ESC cells, while overexpression of p63 induced an increase in
vimentin, SUSD2, and uPA. In addition, knockdown of p63 in ESC cells
significantly reduced levels of ß-catenin and c-Myc, while overexpression of p63 
increased ß-catenin, but reduced p-ß-catenin level. Therefore, p63 regulates the 
migration and invasion of ESC cells through activation of the ß-catenin/c-Myc
pathway. Our results suggest that targeting p63 may constitute a potential
therapeutic strategy for ESC.

MicroRNA miR-199a is clustered with miR-214 on chromosome 1 and its expression is
up-regulated by various factors that are associated with
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), such as a transcriptional repressor
Twist1 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-ß. miR-199a is either up-regulated or
down-regulated in a variety of cancers, although EMT is associated with the
progression of cancer. We found here that miR-199a suppressed the translation of 
SNAI1, a transcriptional repressor that plays a role in EMT, by targeting the
sequence within the 3'UTR of the SNAI1 mRNA, and reduced the protein level of
SNAI1. miR-199a increased the protein level of claudin-1 in both the
TGF-ß1-treated and -untreated cells at least partly by decreasing the protein
level of SNAI1, a transcriptional repressor for claudin-1. In addition, miR-199a 
targeted the sequence within the 3'UTR of the N-cadherin mRNA and suppressed the 
TGF-ß1-induced increase in the protein level of N-cadherin in a manner
independent of SNAI1. These results indicate that miR-199a suppresses the
TGF-ß1-induced protein expression of SNAI1 and N-cadherin.

High expression of Twist is associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor
prognosis in patients with renal cell carcinoma.

Sciences Nagasaki, Japan.

AIMS: Twist has been reported to play crucial roles for malignant aggressiveness;
however, detailed pathological significance of Twist in renal cell carcinoma
(RCC) is not fully understood. The present study was to clarify clinical
significance and molecular functions of Twist in patients with RCC.
METHODS: Twist expression was examined by immunohistochemical techniques in 156
formalin-fixed specimens. Cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis were
measured as the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells (proliferation index, PI),
CD31-stained vessels (microvessel density, MVD), and TUNEL-positive cells
(apoptotic index, AI). In addition, semi-quantification of matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 was performed. Macrophages were identified with
anti-CD68 antibody, and the tumor associated macrophage (TAM) density was
calculated as CD68-positive cells per high-power field.
RESULTS: Twist expression was positively associated with grade, pT stage, and
metastasis (p<0.001). We also noticed that its expression was considerably higher
in cancer cells of sarcomatoid RCC and in those at the edge of the tumors. Twist 
expression was positively correlated with PI, MVD, MMP2 expression, and TAM
density (P<0.001), but not with AI, and MMP-2 expression and TAM density were
independently correlate by multi-variate analyses. Kaplan-Meir survival curves
showed high Twist expression was a worse predictor for cause-specific survival
(P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Twist plays important roles in tumor growth, progression, and
survival in patients with RCC patients. Such pathological mechanisms are
significantly associated with increased cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, 
MMP2 expression, and macrophage recruitment. These findings are important
information for discussion of treatment and observation strategies in these
patients.

MiR-137 regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition in gastrointestinal stromal
tumor.

University, Changsha, Hunan, 410008, China.

Activation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) endows extraordinary
invasive capability of cancer cells and causes of treatment failure and
metastasis in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST); however, the molecular
mechanisms governing GIST invasion remain largely unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs)
have been shown to play critical roles in cell motility and invasion, which
promotes us to study the biological functions of miR-137 in the EMT of GIST. We
have found that miR-137 was dramatically downregulated in clinical specimen of
GIST. Using an in silico analysis approach, Twist1, a key regulator gene of EMT, 
has been identified as the target of miR-137. Quantitative RT-PCT and western
blot were used to confirm that miR-137 directly targeted on Twist1 and repressed 
Twist1 expression in GIST-H1 human gastrointestinal stromal tumor cell line.
Further, miR-137 was found to increase expression of E-cadherin and cytokeratin, 
but suppress expression of N-cadherin and vimentin. In vitro experiments have
shown that miR-137 enhanced the epithelial cell morphology, decreased GIST cell
migration, activated G1 cell cycle arrest, and induced cell apoptosis. These
results suggest a novel mechanism that miR-137 regulates EMT and inhibits cell
migration via Twist1 downregulation. Therefore, miR-137 may function as
anti-migration and anti-metastasis in GIST and our study provides a potential
approach for developing miR-137-based therapeutic strategy for GIST.

BACKGROUND: Disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) have potential to predict the effect 
of adjuvant treatment. The purpose of this study was to compare two methods,
reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunocytochemisty (ICC),
for detecting breast cancer DTCs in bone marrow (BM) from early breast cancer
patients.
METHODS: We investigated a subset (n = 313) of BM samples obtained from 271 early
breast cancer patients in the "Secondary Adjuvant Taxotere Treatment"
(SATT)-trial. All patients in this study had node positive or
intermediate/high-risk node negative non-metastatic disease. The DTCs were
detected by ICC using AE1-AE3 anti-cytokeratin monoclonal antibodies. Patients
with DTCs detected in their BM by ICC after standard adjuvant fluorouracil,
cyclophosphamide, epirubicin (FEC) chemotherapy were offered docetaxel treatment.
For comparison, 5 × 106 mononuclear cells from the aliquoted BM samples were also
analyzed by RT-qPCR using a multimarker (MM) assay based on the tumor cell mRNA
markers keratin 19 (KRT19), mammaglobin A (hMAM), and TWIST1. In the MM-assay, a 
sample was defined as positive for DTCs if at least one of the mRNA markers was
positive.
RESULTS: The MM RT-qPCR assay identified DTCs in 124 (40%) of the 313 BM samples 
compared with 23/313 (7%) of the samples analyzed by ICC. The concordance between
the MM RT-qPCR and ICC was 61% (Kappa value = 0.04) and twelve of the BM samples 
were positive by both methods. By RT-qPCR, 46/313 (15%) samples were positive for
KRT19, 97/313 (31%) for TWIST1, and 3/313 (1%) for hMAM mRNA. There were no
statistically significant associations between the individual mRNA markers.
CONCLUSION: The RT-qPCR based method demonstrated more DTC-positive samples than 
ICC. The relatively low concordance of positive DTC-status between the two
different assessment methods suggests that they may be complementary. The
clinical relevance of the methods will be evaluated based on future clinical
outcome data.

Hypoxia is an important microenvironmental factor in the development of renal
fibrosis; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well elucidated. Here we
show that hypoxia induces Bmi1 mRNA and protein expression in human tubular
epithelial cells. We further demonstrate that Bmi1 expression might be directly
regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) under low oxygen. Moreover,
chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter gene assay studies reveal cooperative 
transactivation of Bmi1 by HIF-1a and Twist. Enforced Bmi1 expression induces
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereas silencing endogenous Bmi-1
expression reverses hypoxia-induced EMT. Up-regulation of Bmi1 leads to
stabilization of Snail via modulation of PI3K/Akt signaling, whereas ablation of 
PI3K/Akt signaling partially rescues the phenotype of Bmi1-overexpressing cells, 
indicating that PI3K/Akt signaling might be a major mediator of Bmi1-induced EMT.
In a rat model of obstructive nephropathy, Bmi1 expression increases in a
time-dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate that increased levels of Bmi1,
correlated with HIF-1a and Twist, are associated with patients with chronic
kidney disease. We provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that activation of
HIF-1a/Twist-Bmi1 signaling in renal epithelial cells is associated with the
development of chronic renal disease and may promote fibrogenesis via modulation 
of PI3K/Akt/Snail signaling by facilitating EMT.

In response to tumor development, cells initially undergo invasion and metastasis
followed by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT, a process by which cells
acquire motility) and overriding senescence (an endogenous defense mechanism
against tumor progression). Oncogenic activation of Twist1 and Twist2 is
essential for EMT and senescence; however, little is known about the specific
contributions of Twist1 versus Twist2 to prognosis, metastasis, and the mechanism
underlying cervical carcinoma. Here, we investigated the similarities and
differences between Twist1 and Twist2 in assessing prognosis and promoting
invasion and metastasis of cervical carcinoma as well as their roles in the
underlying molecular mechanisms. By monitoring the survival of 144 clinical
cervical cancer patients, we demonstrated that Twist2 shows more effective
predictive performance compared with Twist1 and is more closely correlated with
International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage and lymph node
metastasis. Compared with Twist1, Twist2 more strongly promotes invasivity and
motility by inducing EMT and overriding senescence. Differences between Twist1
and Twist2 in regulating senescence and the cell cycle might be due to their
individual roles in regulating the cyclin D1/cyclin dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4)
pathway. Overall, our data indicate that Twist2 is the key Twist isoform coupling
aberrant signals from EMT to senescence and is an important candidate biomarker
for cervical cancer prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in cancer invasion and 
metastasis. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) play role in tumor dissemination and
are an independent survival predictor in breast cancer (BC) patients. The aim of 
this study was to assess correlation between CTCs and tumor MMP1 in BC.
METHODS: Study included 149 primary BC patients treated by surgery from March
2012 to March 2013. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were depleted of
hematopoietic cells using RossetteSep(TM) selection kit. RNA extracted from
CD45-depleted PBMC was interrogated for expression of EMT (TWIST1, SNAIL1, SLUG, 
ZEB1) and epithelial (CK19) gene transcripts by qRT-PCR. Patient samples with
higher epithelial and/or mesenchymal gene transcripts than those of healthy
donors (n = 60) were considered as CTC positive. Expression of MMP1 in surgical
specimens was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: CTCs were detected in 24.2% patients. CTCs exhibiting only epithelial
markers were present in 8.7% patients, whereas CTCs with epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) markers (CTC_EMT) were observed in 13.4% of patients and CTCs
co-expressing both markers were detected in 2.0% patients. Patients with CTC_EMT 
in peripheral blood had significantly increased expression of MMP1 in tumor cells
(p = 0.02) and tumor associated stroma (p = 0.05) than those of patients without 
CTC_EMT. In multivariate analysis, CTC_EMT and tumor grade were independently
associated with MMP1 expression in cancer cells, while CTC_EMT and Ki67 were
independently associated with MMP1 expression in cancer associated stroma.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest link between MMP1 and CTCs with EMT phenotype and
support role of MMPs and EMT in tumor dissemination.

BACKGROUND: Twist1 and Twist2 are highly homologous bHLH transcription factors
that exhibit extensive highly overlapping expression profiles during development.
While both proteins have been shown to inhibit osteogenesis, only Twist1
haploinsufficiency is associated with the premature synostosis of cranial sutures
in mice and humans. On the other hand, biallelic Twist2 deficiency causes only a 
focal facial dermal dysplasia syndrome or additional cachexia and perinatal
lethality in certain mouse strains. It is unclear how these proteins cooperate to
synergistically regulate bone formation.
METHODS: Twist1 floxed mice (Twist1(f/f)) were bred with Twist2-Cre knock-in mice
(Twist2(Cre/+)) to generate Twist1 and Twist2 haploinsufficient mice
(Twist1(f/+); Twist2(Cre/+)). X-radiography, micro-CT scans, alcian blue/alizarin
red staining, trap staining, BrdU labeling, immunohistochemistry, in situ
hybridizations, real-time PCR and dual luciferase assay were employed to
investigate the overall skeletal defects and the bone-associated molecular and
cellular changes of Twist1(f/+);Twist2(Cre/+) mice.
RESULTS: Twist1 and Twist2 haploinsufficient mice did not present with premature 
ossification and craniosynostosis; instead they displayed reduced bone formation,
impaired proliferation and differentiation of osteoprogenitors. These mice
exhibited decreased expressions of Fgf2 and Fgfr1-4 in bone, resulting in a
down-regulation of FGF signaling. Furthermore, in vitro studies indicated that
both Twist1 and Twist2 stimulated 4.9 kb Fgfr2 promoter activity in the presence 
of E12, a Twist binding partner.
CONCLUSION: These data demonstrated that Twist1- and Twist2-haploinsufficiency
caused reduced bone formation due to compromised FGF signaling.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is characterized by the loss of
epithelial markers and the gain of mesenchymal markers. EMT is believed to be a
major mechanism supporting cancer cell metastasis. The activation of EMT can be
induced by various types of inflammatory cytokines including transforming growth 
factor ß (TGF-ß) whereas bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) can inhibit this
process. In this study, the up-regulation of Twist transcription factor and
N-cadherin, mesenchymal marker in CCA tissues, has been demonstrated and it has
been found that the high expression of Twist was significantly associated with
poor prognosis of CCA patients (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.010). Moreover, CCA samples showing Twist
nuclear expression were significantly correlated with the up-regulation of
N-cadherin (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.024). These results also showed that the inflammatory mediator 
TGF-ß induces CCA cell migration, one of the metastatic processes possibly via
stimulation of Twist, N-cadherin and vimentin expression. Additionally, it has
been shown that BMP-7 inhibits TGF-ß-induced CCA cell migration, through
inhibition of TGF-ß-mediated Twist and N-cadherin expressions. These data
reinforce the rationale to use BMP-7 as an EMT inhibitor to suppress the
progression of CCA and might be a therapeutic approach to improve efficiency for 
CCA treatment.

The results of recent studies have shown that metastasis, the most common
malignancy and primary cause of mortality promoted by breast cancer in women, is 
associated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The results of
the current study show that SK228, a novel indole containing substance, exhibits 
anti-cancer activity. In addition, the effects of SK228 on the regulation of EMT 
in breast cancer cells as well as the underlying mechanism have been explored.
SK228 was observed to induce a fibroblastoid to epithelial-like change in the
appearance of various breast cancer cell lines and to suppress the migration and 
invasion of these cancer cells in vitro. Moreover, expression of E-cadherin was
found to increase following SK228 treatment whereas ZEB1 expression was
repressed. Expression of other major EMT inducers, including ZEB2, Slug and
Twist1, is also repressed by SK228 as a consequence of up-regulation of members
of the miR-200 family, especially miR-200c. The results of animal studies
demonstrate that SK228 treatment leads to effective suppression of breast cancer 
growth and metastasis in vivo. The observations made in this investigation show
that SK228 reverses the EMT process in breast cancer cells via an effect on the
miR-200c/ZEB1/E-cadherin signalling pathway. In addition, the results of a
detailed analysis of the in vivo anti-cancer activities of SK228, carried out
using a breast cancer xenograft animal model, show that this substance is a
potential chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of breast cancer.

TRIM29 (ATDC) exhibits a contextual function in cancer, but seems to exert a
tumor-suppressor role in breast cancer. Here, we show that TRIM29 is often
silenced in primary breast tumors and cultured tumor cells as a result of
aberrant gene hypermethylation. RNAi-mediated silencing of TRIM29 in breast tumor
cells increased their motility, invasiveness, and proliferation in a manner
associated with increased expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin and
vimentin), decreased expression of epithelial markers (E-cadherin and EpCAM), and
increased expression and activity of the oncogenic transcription factor TWIST1,
an important driver of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Functional
investigations revealed an inverse relationship in the expression of TRIM29 and
TWIST1, suggesting the existence of a negative regulatory feedback loop. In
support of this relationship, we found that TWIST1 inhibited TRIM29 promoter
activity through direct binding to a region containing a cluster of consensus
E-box elements, arguing that TWIST1 transcriptionally represses TRIM29
expression. Analysis of a public breast cancer gene-expression database indicated
that reduced TRIM29 expression was associated with reduced relapse-free survival,
increased tumor size, grade, and metastatic characteristics. Taken together, our 
results suggest that TRIM29 acts as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer through
its ability to inhibit TWIST1 and suppress EMT.

epithelial-mesenchymal transition in melasma.

Cadherin 11 (CDH11) was identified as a target of miR-675 by using a luciferase
reporter assay. CDH11 expression and miR-675 expression were inversely
correlated. CDH11 expression was not detected in melanocytes, but CDH11
expression in fibroblasts and keratinocytes positively influenced melanogenesis
via the canonical Wnt and AKT activation pathways in cocultured melanocytes.
CDH11 in fibroblasts or keratinocytes induced N-cadherin and Twist1 expression,
while decreasing E-cadherin expression. This suggests a role for CDH11 in
epithelial-mesenchymal transition. CDH11 in fibroblasts also induced the
migration of cocultured melanocytes. N-cadherin knockdown abolished the
tyrosinase expression that was induced in CDH11-overexpressing fibroblasts.
Collectively, our data indicate that CDH11 in fibroblasts and keratinocytes is a 
target of miR-675, and could be involved in melanogenesis through the induction
of N-cadherin during epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key step during embryonic
morphogenesis and plays an important role in drug resistance and metastasis in
diverse solid tumors. We previously reported that 48 h treatment of anti-cancer
drug doxorubicin could induce EMT in human gastric cancer BGC-823 cells. However,
the long term effects of this transient drug treatment were unknown. In this
study we found that after 48 h treatment with 0.1 µg/ml doxorubicin, most cells
died during next week, while a minor population of cells survived and formed
colonies. We propagated the surviving cells in drug free medium and found that
these long term cultured drug survival cells (abbreviated as ltDSCs) retained a
mesenchymal-like cell morphology, and expressed high levels of EMT-related
molecules such as vimentin, twist and ß-catenin. The expression of chromatin
reprogramming factors, Oct4 and c-myc, were also higher in ltDSCs than parental
cells. We further demonstrated that the protein level of p300 was upregulated in 
ltDSCs, and inhibition of p300 by siRNA suppressed the expression of vimentin.
Moreover, the ltDSCs had higher colony forming ability and were more drug
resistant when compared to parental cells. Our results suggested that an
epigenetic mechanism is involved in the EMT of ltDSCs.

Src-homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2 promotes oral cancer
invasion and metastasis.

BACKGROUND: Tumor invasion and metastasis represent a major unsolved problem in
cancer pathogenesis. Recent studies have indicated the involvement of
Src-homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) in multiple
malignancies; however, the role of SHP2 in oral cancer progression has yet to be 
elucidated. We propose that SHP2 is involved in the progression of oral cancer
toward metastasis.
METHODS: SHP2 expression was evaluated in paired oral cancer tissues by using
immunohistochemical staining and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction. Isogenic highly invasive oral cancer cell lines from their respective
low invasive parental lines were established using a Boyden chamber assay, and
changes in the hallmarks of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were
assessed to evaluate SHP2 function. SHP2 activity in oral cancer cells was
reduced using si-RNA knockdown or enforced expression of a catalytically
deficient mutant to analyze migratory and invasive ability in vitro and
metastasis toward the lung in mice in vivo.
RESULTS: We observed the significant upregulation of SHP2 in oral cancer tissues 
and cell lines. Following SHP2 knockdown, the oral cancer cells markedly
attenuated migratory and invasion ability. We observed similar results in
phosphatase-dead SHP2 C459S mutant expressing cells. Enhanced invasiveness was
associated with significant upregulation of E-cadherin, vimentin, Snail/Twist1,
and matrix metalloproteinase-2 in the highly invasive clones. In addition, we
determined that SHP2 activity is required for the downregulation of
phosphorylated ERK1/2, which modulates the downstream effectors, Snail and Twist1
at a transcript level. In lung tissue sections of mice, we observed that HSC3
tumors with SHP2 deletion exhibited significantly reduced metastatic capacity,
compared with tumors administered control si-RNA.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that SHP2 promotes the invasion and metastasis of
oral cancer cells. These results provide a rationale for further investigating
the effects of small-molecule SHP2 inhibitors on the progression of oral cancer, 
and indicate a previously unrecognized SHP2-ERK1/2-Snail/Twist1 pathway that is
likely to play a crucial role in oral cancer invasion and metastasis.

The selective autophagy substrate p62 serves as a molecular link between
autophagy and cancer. Suppression of autophagy causes p62 accumulation and
thereby contributes to tumorigenesis. Here we demonstrate that autophagy
deficiency promotes cell proliferation and migration through p62-dependent
stabilization of the oncogenic transcription factor Twist1. p62 binds to Twist1
and inhibits degradation of Twist1. In mice, p62 up-regulation promotes tumor
cell growth and metastasis in a Twist1-dependent manner. Our findings demonstrate
that Twist1 is a key downstream effector of p62 in regulation of cell
proliferation and migration and suggest that targeting p62-mediated Twist1
stabilization is a promising therapeutic strategy for prevention and treatment of
cancer.

pancreas.

BACKGROUND: Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is a well-established 
entity among pancreatic neoplasms that ranges from low-grade dysplasia to
invasive carcinoma. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to tumor 
progression in various cancers. Moreover, Notch signaling is one of the important
upstream effectors of EMT promotion. Currently, it is unclear whether EMT causes 
pathological progression of IPMN.
AIM: We evaluated the expression of EMT-promoting transcription factors Twist and
B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (Bmi1) in IPMN.
METHODS: Patients who underwent resections at our institute and its affiliated
hospital were enrolled in this study (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>35). Protein expression of EMT markers 
Twist, Bmi1, Jagged1, and E-cadherin in resected specimens was investigated by
immunohistochemistry. Expression of these proteins was compared with the
clinicopathological factors and patient survival.
RESULTS: Positive expression of Twist and Bmi1 was observed in 40.0% and 42.9% of
IPMNs, respectively. Twist and Bmi1 expression was significantly higher in IPMNs 
with high-grade dysplasia (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) and invasive carcinoma (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) than that 
in IPMNs with low-grade dysplasia. High expression of Twist was correlated with
Jagged1 expression and inversely correlated with expression of E-cadherin
(P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.06 and P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05, respectively). In survival analyses, the recurrence rate 
was significantly higher in the group that showed simultaneous high expression of
Twist and Bmi1 (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Expression of Twist and Bmi1 is associated with aggressiveness and
poor prognoses of IPMN through EMT promotion that might be induced by Notch
signaling.

Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) regulates intracellular
signaling networks for inhibition of apoptosis. Tetraspanin (CD63), a cell
surface binding partner for TIMP-1, was previously shown to regulate
integrin-mediated survival pathways in the human breast epithelial cell line
MCF10A. In the current study, we show that TIMP-1 expression induces phenotypic
changes in cell morphology, cell adhesion, cytoskeletal remodeling, and motility,
indicative of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This is evidenced by
loss of the epithelial cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin with an increase in the 
mesenchymal markers vimentin, N-cadherin, and fibronectin. Signaling through
TIMP-1, but not TIMP-2, induces the expression of TWIST1, an important EMT
transcription factor known to suppress E-cadherin transcription, in a
CD63-dependent manner. RNAi-mediated knockdown of TWIST1 rescued E-cadherin
expression in TIMP-1-overexpressing cells, demonstrating a functional
significance of TWIST1 in TIMP-1-mediated EMT. Furthermore, analysis of TIMP-1
structural mutants reveals that TIMP-1 interactions with CD63 that activate cell 
survival signaling and EMT do not require the matrix metalloproteinase
(MMP)-inhibitory domain of TIMP-1. Taken together, these data demonstrate that
TIMP-1 binding to CD63 activates intracellular signal transduction pathways,
resulting in EMT-like changes in breast epithelial cells, independent of its
MMP-inhibitory function.IMPLICATIONS: TIMP-1's function as an endogenous
inhibitor of MMP or as a "cytokine-like" signaling molecule may be a critical
determinant for tumor cell behavior.

CD10 expression is enhanced by Twist1 and associated with poor prognosis in
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with facilitating tumorigenicity in vitro and 
in vivo.

University, Seoul, Korea.

CD10 expression was identified as a contributor to cancer progression in several 
cancers; however, the exact biological significance and mechanism of CD10
expression remains unclear. In addition, CD10 expression in esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma (ESCC) has not been studied. We investigated the relationship
between CD10 and Twist1. Furthermore, we examined the effect of CD10 on
tumorigenicity using in vivo and in vitro systems as well as establishing the
clinical significance of CD10 expression in ESCC using large clinical samples.
CD10 expression was upregulated by Twist1 and there was a strong correlation
between mRNA and protein expression. Twist1 can specifically upregulate CD10 at
the transcriptional level via an interaction with the promoter region of CD10 and
the proximal E-box CAGGTG in the CD10 promoter was identified as a binding site
for Twist1. CD10 is frequently expressed in ESCC cell lines and silencing CD10
suppresses migration/invasion and anchorage-independent tumor growth of ESCC
cells. Knockdown of CD10 inhibits the growth of ESCC xenograft in nude mice,
suggesting that CD10 plays a role in enhancing the tumorigenesis of ESCC. From
among 153 ESCC samples, 46 (30.0%) showed varying degrees of CD10 expression in
cancer cells. In addition, stromal fibroblasts also showed varying amounts of
CD10 expression in 92 (60.9%) tumor samples. CD10 overexpression in cancer cells 
as well as in stromal fibroblasts was an independent poor prognostic factor in
both overall survival and disease-free survival. CD10 could be a promising target
for the treatment of ESCC.

Timed deletion of Twist1 in the limb bud reveals age-specific impacts on autopod 
and zeugopod patterning.

Twist1 encodes a transcription factor that plays a vital role in limb
development. We have used a tamoxifen-inducible Cre transgene, Ubc-CreERT2, to
generate time-specific deletions of Twist1 by inducing Cre activity in mouse
embryos at different ages from embryonic (E) day 9.5 onwards. A novel forelimb
phenotype of supernumerary pre-axial digits and enlargement or partial
duplication of the distal radius was observed when Cre activity was induced at
E9.5. Gene expression analysis revealed significant upregulation of Hoxd10,
Hoxd11 and Grem1 in the anterior half of the forelimb bud at E11.5. There is also
localized upregulation of Ptch1, Hand2 and Hoxd13 at the site of ectopic digit
formation, indicating a posterior molecular identity for the supernumerary
digits. The specific skeletal phenotypes, which include duplication of digits and
distal zeugopods but no overt posteriorization, differ from those of other Twist1
conditional knockout mutants. This outcome may be attributed to the deferment of 
Twist1 ablation to a later time frame of limb morphogenesis, which leads to the
ectopic activation of posterior genes in the anterior tissues after the
establishment of anterior-posterior anatomical identities in the forelimb bud.

miR-300 inhibits epithelial to mesenchymal transition and metastasis by targeting
Twist in human epithelial cancer.

BACKGROUND: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key step of the
progression of tumor cell metastasis. Recent work has demonstrated some miRNAs
play critical roles in EMT. In this study, we focused on the roles of miR-300 in 
regulating EMT.
METHODS: The expression levels of miR-300 were examined in epithelial carcinoma
cells that underwent an EMT using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. The
role of miR-300 in EMT was investigated by transfection of the miR-300 mimic or
inhibitor in natural epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype cell line pairs and in
transforming growth factor (TGF) beta-induced EMT cell models. A luciferase
reporter assay and a rescue experiment were conducted to confirm the target gene 
of miR-300. The efficacy of miR-300 against tumor invasion and metastasis was
evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Correlation analysis between miR-300
expression and the expression levels of its target gene, as well as tumor
metastasis was performed in specimens from patients with head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
RESULTS: MiR-300 was found down-regulated in the HNSCC cells and breast cancer
cells that underwent EMT. Ectopic expression of miR-300 effectively blocked
TGF-beta-induced EMT and reversed the phenotype of EMT in HN-12 and MDA-MB-231
cells, but inhibition of miR-300 in the epithelial phenotype cells, HN-4 and
MCF-7 cells, could induce EMT. The luciferase reporter assay and the rescue assay
results showed that miR-300 directly targets the 3'UTR of Twist. Enforced miR-300
expression suppressed cell invasion in vitro and experimental metastasis in vivo.
Clinically, miR-300 expression was found inversely correlated with Twist
expression and reduced miR-300 was associated with metastasis in patient
specimens.
CONCLUSIONS: Down-regulation of miR-300 is required for EMT initiation and
maintenance. MiR-300 may negatively regulate EMT by direct targeting Twist and
therefore inhibit cancer cell invasion and metastasis, which implicates miR-300
as an attractive candidate for cancer therapy.

The pituitary is an important endocrine tissue of the vertebrate that produces
and secretes many hormones. Accumulating data suggest that several types of cells
compose the pituitary, and there is growing interest in elucidating the origin of
these cell types and their roles in pituitary organogenesis. Therein, the
histogenous cell line is an extremely valuable experimental tool for
investigating the function of derived tissue. In this study, we compared gene
expression profiles by microarray analysis and real-time PCR for murine pituitary
tumor-derived non-hormone-producing cell lines TtT/GF, Tpit/F1 and Tpit/E.
Several genes are characteristically expressed in each cell line: Abcg2, Nestin, 
Prrx1, Prrx2, CD34, Eng, Cspg4 (Ng2), S100ß and nNos in TtT/GF; Cxcl12, Raldh1,
Msx1 and Twist1 in Tpit/F1; and Cxadr, Sox9, Cdh1, EpCAM and Krt8 in Tpit/E.
Ultimately, we came to the following conclusions: TtT/GF cells show the most
differentiated state, and may have some properties of the pituitary vascular
endothelial cell and/or pericyte. Tpit/F1 cells show the epithelial and
mesenchymal phenotypes with stemness still in a transiting state. Tpit/E cells
have a phenotype of epithelial cells and are the most immature cells in the
progression of differentiation or in the initial endothelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT). Thus, these three cell lines must be useful model cell lines
for investigating pituitary stem/progenitor cells as well as organogenesis.

BACKGROUND: BMI1, TWIST1 and SNAI2/SLUG have been implicated in aggressive
behavior of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and melanoma and BMI1 expression could 
identify subtypes of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). However, BMI1, TWIST1 and SNAI2
expression levels in basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) have not been elucidated. We
hypothesized BCC could be a good model system to decipher mechanisms which
inhibit processes that drive tumor metastasis. The aim of this study was to
examine the mRNA expression level of BMI1, TWIST1, and SNAI2 in BCCs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five fresh non-metastatic BCC tissue samples and
seven fresh normal skin tissue samples were evaluated by real-time RT-PCR.
RESULTS: BMI1 and TWIST1 demonstrated marked down-regulation (p<0.00l, p=0.00l
respectively), but SNAI2 showed no significant change (p=0.12).
CONCLUSIONS: Previous literature has clearly demonstrated a positive association 
between BMI1 and TWIST1 expression and metastatic BCC, aggressive SCC and
melanoma. Here, we demonstrated a negative association between BMI1 and TWIST1
mRNA expression level and BCC.

Monoamine oxidase A mediates prostate tumorigenesis and cancer metastasis.

Wu JB, Shao C, Li X, Li Q, Hu P, Shi C, Li Y, Chen YT, Yin F, Liao CP, Stiles BL,
Zhau HE, Shih JC, Chung LW.

Tumors from patients with high-grade aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) exhibit
increased expression of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a mitochondrial enzyme that
degrades monoamine neurotransmitters and dietary amines. Despite the association 
between MAOA and aggressive PCa, it is unclear how MAOA promotes PCa progression.
Here, we found that MAOA functions to induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) and stabilize the transcription factor HIF1a, which mediates hypoxia
through an elevation of ROS, thus enhancing growth, invasiveness, and metastasis 
of PCa cells. Knockdown and overexpression of MAOA in human PCa cell lines
indicated that MAOA induces EMT through activation of VEGF and its coreceptor
neuropilin-1. MAOA-dependent activation of neuropilin-1 promoted AKT/FOXO1/TWIST1
signaling, allowing FOXO1 binding at the TWIST1 promoter. Importantly, the
MAOA-dependent HIF1a/VEGF-A/FOXO1/TWIST1 pathway was activated in high-grade PCa 
specimens, and knockdown of MAOA reduced or even eliminated prostate tumor growth
and metastasis in PCa xenograft mouse models. Pharmacological inhibition of MAOA 
activity also reduced PCa xenograft growth in mice. Moreover, high MAOA
expression in PCa tissues correlated with worse clinical outcomes in PCa
patients. These findings collectively characterize the contribution of MAOA in
PCa pathogenesis and suggest that MAOA has potential as a therapeutic target in
PCa.

CONTEXT: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is one of the most aggressive human
tumors. Twist1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor involved in
cancer development and progression. We showed that Twist1 affects thyroid cancer 
cell survival and motility.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify Twist1 targets in thyroid cancer cells.
DESIGN: Transcriptional targets of Twist1 were identified by gene expression
profiling the TPC-Twist1 cells in comparison with control cells. Functional
studies were performed by silencing in TPC-Twist1 and in CAL62 cells the top 10
upregulated genes and by evaluating cell proliferation, survival, migration, and 
invasion. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed to verify direct binding of
Twist1 to target genes. Quantitative RT-PCR was applied to study the expression
level of Twist1 target genes in human thyroid carcinoma samples.
RESULTS: According to the gene expression profile, the top functions enriched in 
TPC-Twist1 cells were cellular movement, cellular growth and proliferation, and
cell death and survival. Silencing of the top 10 upregulated genes reduced
viability of TPC-Twist1 and of CAL62 cells. Silencing of COL1A1, KRT7, and PDZK1 
also induced cell death. Silencing of HS6ST2, THRB, ID4, RHOB, and PDZK1IP also
impaired migration and invasion of TPC-Twist1 and of CAL62 cells. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation showed that Twist1 directly binds the promoter of the top 10 
upregulated genes. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that HS6ST2, COL1A1, F2RL1,
LEPREL1, PDZK1, and PDZK1IP1 are overexpressed in thyroid carcinoma samples
compared with normal thyroids.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a set of genes that mediates Twist1 biological effects
in thyroid cancer cells.

TWIST1 is implicated in the process of epithelial mesenchymal transition,
metastasis, stemness, and drug resistance in cancer cells, and therefore is a
potential target for cancer therapy. In the present study, we found that
knockdown of TWIST1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) enhanced arsenic trioxide
(ATO)- and ionizing radiation (IR)-induced cell death in non-small-cell lung
cancer cells. Interestingly, intracellular reactive oxygen species levels were
increased in cells treated with TWIST1 siRNA and further increased by
co-treatment with ATO or IR. Pretreatment of lung cancer cells with the
antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine markedly suppressed the cell death induced by
combined treatment with TWIST1 siRNA and ATO or IR. Moreover, treatment of cells 
with TWIST1 siRNA induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and significantly
increased mitochondrial fragmentation (fission) and upregulated the
fission-related proteins FIS1 and DRP1. Collectively, our results demonstrate
that siRNA-mediated TWIST1 knockdown induces mitochondrial dysfunction and
enhances IR- and ATO-induced cell death in lung cancer cells.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most fatal cancers. Although the
involvement of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC progression 
is established, the mechanisms modulating this phenomenon remain unclear. Here,
we demonstrate that hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), HIF-1a and HIF-2a, modulate
the EMT through Twist1, a regulator of the EMT. The levels of HIF-1a and HIF-2a
in HCC tissues were higher than those in matched, non-tumor surrounding tissues. 
In HCC samples, the levels of HIF-1a and HIF-2a negatively correlated with the
levels of E-cadherin but positively correlated with the levels of vimentin. In
highly metastatic MHCC97H cells, the levels of HIF-1a, HIF-2a, and Twist1 were
higher than those in weakly metastatic HepG2 cells. In HepG2 cells,
over-expression of HIFs enhanced levels of Twist1 and the EMT, which elevated the
migratory and neoplastic capacities of cells. For MHCC97H cells, inhibition of
HIFs reduced Twist1 levels and the EMT, which reduced their migratory and
neoplastic capacity. Thus, the promotion of EMT by HIFs via Twist1 enhanced the
migration and neoplastic capacities of HCC cells.

BACKGROUND: Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is involved in cancer cell
invasion and metastasis as well as chemoresistance. Elucidation of EMT in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) might contribute to deeper understanding of its
biology.
METHODS: Overall, 100 patients with HCC, who underwent resection, were analyzed. 
The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and the
mesenchymal marker Vimentin were measured, and the EMT status of each patient was
determined as follows: Vimentin/E-cadherin <2 = Epithelial (E),
Vimentin/E-cadherin =2 = Mesenchymal (M). The correlation between these values
and clinicopathological factors and prognosis were analyzed statistically.
Moreover, the expression of transcription factors involved in EMT (Twist-1,
Snail, Slug, Zeb-1, and Zeb-2) were measured and the role of interleukin (IL)-6
in inducing EMT and chemoresistance was examined.
RESULTS: Patients with a mesenchymal tumor were more prone to have an earlier
recurrence than those with an epithelial tumor. EMT-inducing transcription
factors were more highly expressed in mesenchymal tumors than in epithelial
tumors, and Twist-1 and Zeb-2 were significantly overexpressed. a-Fetoprotein
(AFP) values were significantly higher in patients with epithelial tumors, and
AFP-expressing HCC cell lines were more responsive to sorafenib. IL-6 expression 
was significantly higher in mesenchymal tumors, and knockdown of IL-6 in
mesenchymal HCC cell lines increased E-cadherin expression and sensitivity to
sorafenib.
CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of surgically resected tumors suggests that EMT is involved
in early disease recurrence in HCC. Twist-1 and Zeb-2 might be important for
inducing EMT, and IL-6 might be a potential therapeutic target for alleviating
the chemoresistance of mesenchymal HCC tumors.

Cardiac malformations due to aberrant development of the atrioventricular (AV)
valves are among the most common forms of congenital heart diseases. Normally,
heart valve mesenchyme is formed from an endothelial to mesenchymal transition
(EMT) of endothelial cells of the endocardial cushions. Yes-associated protein 1 
(YAP1) has been reported to regulate EMT in vitro, in addition to its known role 
as a major regulator of organ size and cell proliferation in vertebrates, leading
us to hypothesize that YAP1 is required for heart valve development. We tested
this hypothesis by conditional inactivation of YAP1 in endothelial cells and
their derivatives. This resulted in markedly hypocellular endocardial cushions
due to impaired formation of heart valve mesenchyme by EMT and to reduced
endocardial cell proliferation. In endothelial cells, TGFß induces nuclear
localization of Smad2/3/4 complex, which activates expression of Snail, Twist1,
and Slug, key transcription factors required for EMT. YAP1 interacts with this
complex, and loss of YAP1 disrupts TGFß-induced up-regulation of Snail, Twist1,
and Slug. Together, our results identify a role of YAP1 in regulating EMT through
modulation of TGFß-Smad signaling and through proliferative activity during
cardiac cushion development.

The microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, 20-22 nucleotides in length,
endogenously expressed noncoding RNAs that regulate multiple targets
posttranscriptionally. Interestingly, miRNAs have emerged as regulators of most
physiological and pathological processes, including metastatic tumor progression,
in part by controlling a reversible process called epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT). The activation of EMT increases the migratory and invasive
properties fundamental for tumor cell spread while activation of the reverse
mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition is required for metastasis outgrowth. The
EMT triggering leads to the activation of a core of transcription factors
(EMT-TFs) - SNAIL1/SNAIL2, bHLH (E47, E2-2, and TWIST1/TWIST2), and ZEB1/ZEB2 -
that act as E-cadherin repressors and, ultimately, coordinate EMT. Recent
evidence indicates that several miRNAs regulate the expression of EMT-TFs or
EMT-activating signaling pathways. Interestingly, some miRNAs and EMT-TFs form
tightly interconnected negative feedback loops that control epithelial cell
plasticity, providing self-reinforcing signals and robustness to maintain the
epithelial or mesenchymal cell status. Among the most significant feedback loops,
we focus on the ZEB/miR-200 and the SNAIL1/miR-34 networks that hold a clear
impact in the regulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal state. Recent insights
into the p53 modulation of the EMT-TF/miRNA loops and epigenetic regulatory
mechanisms in the context of metastasis dissemination will also be discussed.
Understanding the regulation of EMT by miRNAs opens new avenues for the diagnosis
and prognosis of tumors and identifies potential therapeutic targets that might
help to negatively impact on metastasis dissemination and increasing patient
survival.

Multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the most important obstacles affecting the
efficacy of chemotherapy treatments for numerous types of cancer. In the present 
study, we have demonstrated the possible function of Twist1 in the
chemosensitivity of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and have
identified that its mechanism maybe associated with MDR1/P-gp regulation. To
investigate this, the hypopharyngeal cancer cell line, FaDu, and its MDR cell
line induced by taxol, FaDu/T, were employed. Stable transfectants targeted to
Twist1 overexpression and Twist1 silencing based on FaDu were also conducted.
Morphological observation, flow cytometry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting and laser scanning confocal microscope
detection were utilized to detect the associations between Twist1 and the
chemosensitivity of FaDu cells. Our results demonstrated that Twist1 and
MDR1/P-gp were upregulated in FaDu/T cells in a MDR dose-dependent manner. The
anti-apoptotic capabilities of FaDu/T cells were enhanced during MDR progression,
with apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2, Bax, activated caspase-3 and caspase-9)
changing to resist apoptosis. Twist1 overexpression decreased the sensitivity of 
cells to taxol as revealed by a significant increase in MDR1/P-gp and IC50
(P<0.05). This overexpression also enhanced the resistance to apoptosis, with
apoptotic proteins changing to resist cell death, and inhibited Ca2+ release
induced by taxol (P<0.05). Detections in Twist1 silencing cells also confirmed
this result. This study provided evidence that alterations of Twist1 expression
modulates the chemosensitivity of FaDu cells to taxol. Therefore, Twist1
knockdown may be a promising treatment regimen for advanced hypopharyngeal
carcinoma patients with MDR.

PURPOSE: Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1A1) has now been recognized as a cancer
stem(-like) cells (CSCs) marker in various tumors including head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The objective of this study was to examine the
expression of ALDH1A1 in patients with locally advanced, metastasized HNSCC and
to determine its prognostic value.
METHODS: Human papillomavirus genotypes and expression of ALDH1A1, Twist1, and
p16 were analyzed in specimens of 81 patients with primary HNSCC and 49 lymph
node metastases. Patient clinicopathologic and follow-up data were analyzed.
RESULTS: Expression of ALDH1A1 was observed in 38 (46.9 %) of 81 primary tumors
and 26 (53 %) of 49 lymph node metastases, respectively. Notably, the expression 
of ALDH1A1 was correlated significantly with poor tumor differentiation grade (p 
= 0.011). Interestingly, ALDH1A1 was observed co-expressed with Twist1 in primary
tumor and lymph node metastases. Multivariate analysis showed that ALDH1A1
expression predicted poor prognosis in patients with HNSCC (p = 0.011) and the
subgroup of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (p = 0.001). In the patient
cohort with advanced, metastasized tumors, ALDH1A1 was identified as independent 
predictor of overall survival in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence for the prognostic value of ALDH1A1 as 
a CSC marker in patients with locally advanced, metastasized HNSCC.

Twist1 and Twist2 (Twist1-2) are two transcription factors, members of the basic 
helix-loop-helix family, that have been well established as master
transcriptional regulators of embryogenesis and developmental programs of
mesenchymal cell lineages. Their role in oncogenesis in epithelium-derived cancer
and in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition has also been thoroughly
characterized. Recently, emerging evidence also suggests a key role for Twist1-2 
in the function and development of hematopoietic cells, as well as in survival
and development of numerous hematological malignancies. In this review, we
summarize the latest data that depict the role of Twist1-2 in monocytes, T cells 
and B lymphocyte activation, and in associated hematological malignancies.

Metastatic dissemination of ovarian tumors involves the invasion of tumor cell
clusters into the mesothelial cell lining of peritoneal cavity organs; however,
the tumor-specific factors that allow ovarian cancer cells to spread are unclear.
We used an in vitro assay that models the initial step of ovarian cancer
metastasis, clearance of the mesothelial cell layer, to examine the clearance
ability of a large panel of both established and primary ovarian tumor cells.
Comparison of the gene and protein expression profiles of clearance-competent and
clearance-incompetent cells revealed that mesenchymal genes are enriched in tumor
populations that display strong clearance activity, while epithelial genes are
enriched in those with weak or undetectable activity. Overexpression of
transcription factors SNAI1, TWIST1, and ZEB1, which regulate the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoted mesothelial clearance in
cell lines with weak activity, while knockdown of the EMT-regulatory
transcription factors TWIST1 and ZEB1 attenuated mesothelial clearance in ovarian
cancer cell lines with strong activity. These findings provide important insights
into the mechanisms associated with metastatic progression of ovarian cancer and 
suggest that inhibiting pathways that drive mesenchymal programs may suppress
tumor cell invasion of peritoneal tissues.

The cell surface proteins CD133, CD24 and CD44 are putative markers for cancer
stem cell populations in colon cancer, associated with aggressive cancer types
and poor prognosis. It is important to understand how these markers may predict
treatment outcomes, determined by factors such as radioresistance. The scope of
this study was to assess the connection between EGFR, CD133, CD24, and CD44
(including isoforms) expression levels and radiation sensitivity, and furthermore
analyze the influence of AKT isoforms on the expression patterns of these
markers, to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms in the cell.
Three colon cancer cell-lines were used, HT-29, DLD-1, and HCT116, together with 
DLD-1 isogenic AKT knock-out cell-lines. All three cell-lines (HT-29, HCT116 and 
DLD-1) expressed varying amounts of CD133, CD24 and CD44 and the top ten percent 
of CD133 and CD44 expressing cells (CD133high/CD44high) were more resistant to
gamma radiation than the ten percent with lowest expression (CD133low/CD44low).
The AKT expression was lower in the fraction of cells with low CD133/CD44.
Depletion of AKT1 or AKT2 using knock out cells showed for the first time that
CD133 expression was associated with AKT1 but not AKT2, whereas the CD44
expression was influenced by the presence of either AKT1 or AKT2. There were
several genes in the cell adhesion pathway which had significantly higher
expression in the AKT2 KO cell-line compared to the AKT1 KO cell-line; however
important genes in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition pathway (CDH1, VIM,
TWIST1, SNAI1, SNAI2, ZEB1, ZEB2, FN1, FOXC2 and CDH2) did not differ. Our
results demonstrate that CD133high/CD44high expressing colon cancer cells are
associated with AKT and increased radiation resistance, and that different AKT
isoforms have varying effects on the expression of cancer stem cell markers,
which is an important consideration when targeting AKT in a clinical setting.

Exploring the IL-21-STAT3 axis as therapeutic target for Sézary syndrome.

Netherlands.

Sézary syndrome is an aggressive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The malignant cells
(Sézary cells) are present in skin, lymph nodes, and blood, and express
constitutively activated signal transducer and activator of transcription
(STAT)3. STAT3 can be activated by IL-21 in vitro and the IL-21 gene itself is a 
STAT3 target gene, thereby creating an autocrine positive feedback loop that
might serve as a therapeutic target. Sézary cells underwent apoptosis when
incubated with Stattic, a selective STAT3 inhibitor. STAT3 activation in Sézary
cells did not affect expression of the supposed anti-apoptotic STAT3 target genes
BCL2, BCL-xL, and SURVIVIN, whereas expression of (proto)oncogenes miR-21,
TWIST1, MYC, and PIM1 was significantly increased. CD3/CD28-mediated activation
of Sézary cells induced IL-21 expression, accompanied by STAT3 activation and
increased proliferation. Blocking IL-21 in CD3/CD28-activated cells had no
effects, whereas Stattic abrogated IL-21 expression and cell proliferation. Thus,
specific inhibition of STAT3 is highly efficient in the induction of apoptosis of
Sézary cells, likely mediated via the regulation of (proto)oncogenes. In
contrast, blocking IL-21 alone seems insufficient to affect STAT3 activation,
cell proliferation, or apoptosis. These data provide further insights into the
pathogenic role of STAT3 in Sézary syndrome and strengthen the notion that STAT3 
represents a promising therapeutic target in this disease.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive malignancy arising from
mesothelial lining of pleura. It is generally associated with a history of
asbestos exposure and has a very poor prognosis, partly due to the lack of a
precise understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with its malignant
behavior. In the present study, we expanded on our previous studies on the
enhanced motility and increased CD26 expression in MPM cells, with a particular
focus on integrin adhesion molecules. We found that expression of CD26
upregulates periostin secretion by MPM cells, leading to enhanced MPM cell
migratory and invasive activity. Moreover, we showed that upregulation of
periostin expression results from the nuclear translocation of the basic
helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist1, a process that is mediated by
CD26-associated activation of Src phosphorylation. While providing new and
profound insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in MPM biology, these
findings may also lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for
MPM.

TCF12 mutations have been reported very recently in coronal synostosis. We report
several cases of familial coronal synostosis among four families harbouring novel
TCF12 mutations. We observed a broad interfamilial phenotypic spectrum with
features overlapping with the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. TCF12 molecular testing
should be considered in patients with unilateral- or bilateral-coronal synostosis
associated or not with syndactyly, after having excluded mutations in the TWIST1 
gene and the p.Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3.

The aims of the study were to establish the prevalence of high bone mass (HBM) in
a cohort of Spanish postmenopausal women (BARCOS) and to assess the contribution 
of LRP5 and DKK1 mutations and of common bone mineral density (BMD) variants to a
HBM phenotype. Furthermore, we describe the expression of several
osteoblast-specific and Wnt-pathway genes in primary osteoblasts from two HBM
cases. A 0.6% of individuals (10/1600) displayed Z-scores in the HBM range (sum
Z-score >4). While no mutation in the relevant exons of LRP5 was detected, a rare
missense change in DKK1 was found (p.Y74F), which cosegregated with the phenotype
in a small pedigree. Fifty-five BMD SNPs from Estrada et al. [NatGenet
44:491-501,2012] were genotyped in the HBM cases to obtain risk scores for each
individual. In this small group of samples, Z-scores were found inversely related
to risk scores, suggestive of a polygenic etiology. There was a single exception,
which may be explained by a rare penetrant genetic variant, counterbalancing the 
additive effect of the risk alleles. The expression analysis in primary
osteoblasts from two HBM cases and five controls suggested that IL6R, DLX3,
TWIST1 and PPARG are negatively related to Z-score. One HBM case presented with
high levels of RUNX2, while the other displayed very low SOX6. In conclusion, we 
provide evidence of lack of LRP5 mutations and of a putative HBM-causing mutation
in DKK1. Additionally, we present SNP genotyping and expression results that
suggest additive effects of several genes for HBM.

Inhibition of Integrin-HER2 signaling by Cucurbitacin B leads to in vitro and in 
vivo breast tumor growth suppression.

University Health Sciences Center, Amarillo, TX, USA.

HER2, an oncogenic receptor is overexpressed in about 25-30% of breast cancer
patients. HER2 has been shown to play role in tumor promotion by having
cross-talk with multiple oncogenic pathways in cancer cells. Our results show
that Cucurbitacin B (CuB), a triterpenoid steroidal compound inhibited the growth
of various breast cancer cells with an IC50 ranging from 18-50nM after 48 and 72 
h of treatment. Our study also revealed the significant inhibitory effects of CuB
on HER2 and integrin signaling in breast cancer. Notably, CuB inhibited ITGA6 and
ITGB4 (integrin a6 and integrin ß4), which are overexpressed in breast cancer.
Furthermore, CuB also induced the expression of major ITGB1and ITGB3, which are
known to cause integrin-mediated cell death. In addition, we observed that TGFß
treatment resulted in the increased association of HER2 with ITGA6 and this
association was inhibited by CuB treatment. Efficacy of CuB was tested in vivo
using two different orthotopic models of breast cancer. MDA-MB-231 and 4T-1 cells
were injected orthotopically in the mammary fat pad of female athymic nude mice
or BALB/c mice respectively. Our results showed that CuB administration inhibited
MDA-MB-231 orthotopic tumors by 55%, and 4T-1 tumors by 40%. The 4T-1 cells
represent stage IV breast cancer and form very aggressive tumors. CuB mediated
breast tumor growth suppression was associated with the inhibition of
HER2/integrin signaling. Our results suggest novel targets of CuB in breast
cancer in vitro and in vivo.

To evaluate the possible prognostic value of Steroid Receptor Coactivator-1
(SRC-1) and Twist1 expression in human breast cancer, we examined SRC-1 and
Twist1 expression using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray sections
containing 137 breast cancer specimens. All patients were followed up for a
median of 5 years following surgery. Survival curves were generated using the
Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox
proportional hazard regression model to assess the prognostic values. The results
showed a positive correlation between SRC-1 and Twist1 expression at protein
levels (P < 0.001). Also, SRC-1 expression positively correlated with HER2
expression (P = 0.024). The protein expression of Twist1 positively associated
with lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001), but inversely correlated with PR status
(P = 0.041). Patients with SRC-1 or Twist1-positive expression exhibited poorer
overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) than did those with SRC-1
or Twist1-negative expression (P < 0.05 for all). In addition,
SRC-1-negativeive/Twist1-negative patients had the best OS and DFS (P < 0.01 for 
both). In multivariate survival analysis, SRC-1 expression, tumor stage, and PR
were found to be independent prognostic factors related to OS (P = 0.019, < 0.001
and 0.02, respectively) and Twist1 expression, lymph node status and PR were
independent predictors of DFS (P = 0.006, 0.001 and 0.029, respectively). These
results suggest that a combined SRC-1/Twist1 expression status could improve the 
prognostic judgment for breast cancer patients.

miR-375 inhibits Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric carcinogenesis by blocking
JAK2-STAT3 signaling.

Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tong Jiaxiang Road, Nanjing,

Gastric cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths
worldwide. Although Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is considered to be a
critical risk factor, the molecular mechanisms underlying H. pylori-induced
gastric carcinogenesis are still poorly defined. Recently, accumulating studies
have revealed that microRNAs play key roles in development, differentiation,
immune regulation, and even carcinogenesis. This study was performed to explore
the mechanism of microRNA-375 (miR-375) in H. pylori promotion of gastric
carcinogenesis. It was shown that miR-375 was down-regulated in response to H.
pylori infection in gastric epithelial cell lines; this finding was quite
opposite to the expression patterns of pro-inflammatory cytokines observed in a
co-culture cell model. Moreover, the ectopic expression of miR-375 aggravated
cell proliferation and migration. It was further observed that Janus kinase 2
(JAK2) was a bona fide target of miR-375 and further activated signal transducer 
and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and other downstream target molecules.
Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments showed that decreased
miR-375 expression could mimic the oncogenic effects of the JAK2-STAT3 pathway.
In addition, pretreatment with siRNAs targeting JAK2 prevented gastric epithelial
cells from increasing proliferation and migration even in response to H. pylori
infection. For the first time, our results demonstrate that the JAK2-STAT3
pathway regulated by miR-375 is involved in H. pylori-induced inflammation; this 
pathway promotes neoplastic transformation by affecting the expression of BCL-2
and TWIST1, hence offering a potential therapeutic target for
inflammation-related cancers, especially those related to H. pylori.

INTRODUCTION: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) that present mesenchymal phenotypes 
can escape standard methods of isolation, thus limiting possibilities for their
characterization. Whereas mesenchymal CTCs are considered to be more malignant
than epithelial CTCs, factors responsible for this aggressiveness have not been
thoroughly defined. This study analyzed the molecular profile related to
metastasis formation potential of CTC-enriched blood fractions obtained by marker
unbiased isolation from breast cancer patients without (N-) and with lymph nodes 
metastases (N+).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples drawn from 117 patients with early-stage
breast cancer were enriched for CTCs using density gradient centrifugation and
negative selection with anti-CD45 covered magnetic particles. In the resulting
CTC-enriched blood fractions, expression of CK19, MGB1, VIM, TWIST1, SNAIL, SLUG,
HER2, CXCR4 and uPAR was analyzed with qPCR. Results were correlated with
patients' clinicopathological data.
RESULTS: CTCs (defined as expression of either CK19, MGB1 or HER2) were detected 
in 41% (20/49) of N- and 69% (34/49) of N+ patients (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.004). CTC-enriched
blood fractions of N+ patients were more frequently VIM (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.02), SNAIL
(P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.059) and uPAR-positive (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.03). Positive VIM, CXCR4 and uPAR status
correlated with >3 lymph nodes involved (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.003, P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.01 and P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.045,
respectively). In the multivariate logistic regression MGB1 and VIM-positivity
were independently related to lymph node involvement with corresponding overall
risk of 3.2 and 4.2. Moreover, mesenchymal CTC-enriched blood fractions
(CK19-/VIM+ and MGB1+ or HER2+) had 4.88 and 7.85-times elevated expression of
CXCR4 and uPAR, respectively, compared with epithelial CTC-enriched blood
fractions (CK19+/VIM- and MGB1+ or HER2+).
CONCLUSIONS: Tumors of N+ patients have superior CTC-seeding and metastatic
potential compared with N- patients. These differences can be attributed to VIM, 
uPAR and CXCR4 expression, which endow tumor cells with particularly malignant
phenotypes.

OBJECTIVE: Valve calcification involves transdifferentiation of valve
interstitial cells (VICs) into osteoblasts. Twist-related protein 1 (TWIST1) has 
been established as a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation in both
mouse and human mesenchymal stem cells, but its function in human aortic VICs is 
unknown. In our study, we determined the mechanism of TWIST1 action in regulating
osteoblastic transdifferentiation of human aortic VICs.
METHODS: Human calcified and noncalcified aortic valves were examined for TWIST1 
expression. Human aortic VICs were isolated and cultured.
RESULTS: The data showed that calcified aortic valves express lower levels of
TWIST1. In vitro experiments showed that TWIST1 overexpression inhibited the
transdifferentiation of VICs into osteoblasts by decreasing the expression of
runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and its downstream osteoblastic
markers. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation and dual luciferase assays, we
found that TWIST1 repressed the expression of RUNX2 by directly binding to an
E-box located at -820 bp of the RUNX2 P2 promoter region and inhibiting its
activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study results suggest that TWIST1 could play an important role
in preventing human aortic valve calcification by negatively regulating
osteoblastic transdifferentiation of human aortic VICs through direct inhibition 
of RUNX2.

MicroRNA-543 suppresses endometrial cancer oncogenicity via targeting FAK and
TWIST1 expression.

(1)Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, The Military General Hospital of
Beijing PLA, Beijing, 100700, China.

INTRODUCTION: Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a critical mediator of extracellular
matrix signaling, cell survival, proliferation and motility. Twist homolog 1
(TWIST1) is a transcription factor and serves as a powerful oncogene. Increased
FAK and TWIST1 expression are observed in a variety of solid human tumors and
correlate with metastasis and poor survival.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we identify miR-543 as a direct regulator of FAK and
TWIST1 expression in endometrial cancer.
RESULTS: Forced expression of miR-543 in endometrial cancer cell lines decreases 
both endogenous FAK and TWIST1 mRNA and protein levels. Forced expression of
miR-543 in aggressive endometrial cancer cell lines also impairs tumor cell
monolayer proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, migration and invasion.
Endogenous miR-543 expression is decreased in malignant versus normal endometrium
tissue and the levels of miR-543 inversely correlate with mRNA levels of FAK and 
TWIST1.
CONCLUSIONS: miR-543 expression is decreased in endometrial cancer and serves as 
a tumor suppressor by targeting FAK and TWIST1 expression.

TWIST1 plays a crucial role in dentinogenesis, and its activity depends on both a
dimerization partner selection and phosphorylation. Other factors, like Id
proteins, can affect the availability of dimerization partners for TWIST1,
subsequently leading to diverse biological outcomes. The purpose of this study
was to evaluate an impact of Id1 expression on differentiation of dental pulp
stem cells (DPSCs). The altered expression of Id1 was achieved by transfection of
human DPSCs with lentiviral vectors either driving an entire sequence of Id1,
hence leading to Id1 overexpression, or carrying the Id1 silencing sequence. We
observed that both overexpression and silencing of Id1 modulated human DPSC
differentiation. Id1 overexpression resulted in a prevailing formation of TWIST1 
homodimer and increased expression of genes encoding dentin sialophosphoprotein
and dentin matrix protein 1, which confirm an enhanced odontogenic
differentiation of DPSCs. Concurrently, Id1 silencing produced an opposite
effect, slowing DPSC differentiation. These results highlight Id1 as an important
modulator of molecular events during DPSC commitment and differentiation, which
should be considered in dental research on tissue engineering. Moreover, we
assume that the balance between TWIST1 dimerization forms in DPSCs might function
in a cell-type-specific manner.

Conserved transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in aortic valve development and
disease.

Wirrig EE(1), Yutzey KE.

Author information: 
(1)From The Heart Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center,
Cincinnati, OH.

There is increasing evidence for activation of developmental transcriptional
regulatory pathways in heart valve disease. Here, we review molecular regulatory 
mechanisms involved in heart valve progenitor development, leaflet morphogenesis,
and extracellular matrix organization that also are active in diseased aortic
valves. These include regulators of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transitions, such 
as the Notch pathway effector RBPJ, and the valve progenitor markers Twist1,
Msx1/2, and Sox9. Little is known of the potential reparative or pathological
functions of these developmental mechanisms in adult aortic valves, but it is
tempting to speculate that valve progenitor cells could contribute to repair in
the context of disease. Likewise, loss of either RBPJ or Sox9 leads to aortic
valve calcification in mice, supporting a potential therapeutic role in
prevention of disease. During aortic valve calcification, transcriptional
regulators of osteogenic development are activated in addition to valve
progenitor regulatory programs. Specifically, the transcription factor Runx2 and 
its downstream target genes are induced in calcified valves. Runx2 and osteogenic
genes also are induced with vascular calcification, but activation of valve
progenitor markers and the cellular context of expression are likely to be
different for valve and vascular calcification. Additional research is necessary 
to determine whether developmental mechanisms contribute to valve repair or
whether these pathways can be harnessed for new treatments of heart valve
disease.

Tumor malignancy is associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
process and resistance to chemotherapy. However, little is known about the
relationship between the EMT and the multidrug-resistance gene in thyroid tumor
progression. We investigated whether the expression of the ABCG2/BCRP gene is
associated with ZEB1 and other EMT inducer genes involved in tumor
dedifferentiation. We established a subpopulation of cells that express the
ABCG2/BCRP gene derived from the thyroid papillary carcinoma cell line (TPC-1),
the so-called TPC-1 MITO-resistant subline. The most relevant findings in these
TPC-1 selected cells were a statistically significant upregulation of ZEB1 and
TWIST1 (35- and 15-fold change respectively), no changes in the relative
expression of vimentin and SNAIL1, and no expression of E-cadherin. The TPC-1
MITO-resistant subline displayed a faster migration and greater invasive ability 
than parental cells in correlation with a significant upregulation of the
survivin (BIRC5) gene (twofold change, P<0.05). The knockdown of ZEB1 promoted
nuclear re-expression of E-cadherin, reduced expression of vimentin, N-cadherin, 
and BIRC5 genes, and reduced cell migration (P<0.05). Analysis of human thyroid
carcinoma showed a slight overexpression of the ABCG2/BCRP at stages I and II
(P<0.01), and a higher overexpression at stages III and IV (P<0.01). SNAIL1,
TWIST1, and ZEB1 genes showed higher expression at stages III and IV than at
stages I and II. E- and N-cadherin genes were upregulated at stages I and II of
the disease (ninefold and tenfold change, respectively, P<0.01) but downregulated
at stages III and IV (fourfold lower, P<0.01). These results could be a promising
starting point for further study of the role of the ABCG2/BCRP gene in the
progression of thyroid tumor.

METHODS: The CNE-1 cell line was treated with different concentrations of BH and 
effects on cell viability and proliferation were evaluated using the Cell
Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Anti-migratory and anti-invasive actions of BH were
investigated using wound healing assays and the Millicell Hanging cell culture
insert system, respectively. Expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
(EMT)-related gene twist (Twist) was analyzed by real-time PCR and Western
blotting. Apoptosis was estimated with an annexin-V fluorescein (FITC) apoptosis 
detection kit, as well as with reference to levels of activated caspase-3 of
CNE-1 cells before and after treatment with BH utilizing fluorescence
spectroscopy.
RESULTS: BH was capable of reducing proliferation and viability of CNE-1 cells in
a dose- and time-dependent manner, also demonstrating anti-migratory and
anti-invasive capacities which correlated with reduction in expression of Twist. 
Finally, BH was able to induce significant amounts of apoptosis in CNE-1 cells,
as demonstrated by an increase in the activity of caspase-3 and in annexin-V
staining following treatment.
CONCLUSION: BH extracted from rhizoma coptidis demonstrated an ability to block
proliferation, induce apoptosis, and impair the migration and invasion of the
CNE-1 cell line Considering these properties, our results suggest that BH could
be an important compound for consideration in the treatment of nasopharyngeal
carcinoma.

In vitro tissue models are useful tools for the development of novel therapy
strategies in cartilage repair and care. The limited availability of human
primary tissue and high costs of animal models hamper preclinical tests of
innovative substances and techniques. In this study we tested the potential of
porcine chondrocyte micromass cultures to mimic human articular cartilage and
essential aspects of osteoarthritis (OA) in vitro. Primary chondrocytes were
enzymatically isolated from porcine femoral condyles and were maintained in
96-multiwell format to establish micromass cultures in a high-throughput scale.
Recombinant porcine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) was used to induce
OA-like changes documented on histological (Safranin O, collagen type II
staining), biochemical (hydroxyproline assay, dimethylmethylene blue method), and
gene expression level (Affymetrix porcine microarray, real time PCR) and were
compared with published data from human articular cartilage and human micromass
cultures. After 14 days in micromass culture, porcine primary chondrocytes
produced ECM rich in proteoglycans and collagens. On gene expression level,
significant correlations of detected genes with porcine cartilage (r = 0.90),
human cartilage (r = 0.71), and human micromass culture (r = 0.75) were observed 
including 34 cartilage markers such as COL2A1, COMP, and aggrecan. TNF-a
stimulation led to significant proteoglycan (-75%) and collagen depletion (-50%).
Comparative expression pattern analysis revealed the involvement of catabolic
enzymes (MMP1, -2, -13, ADAM10), chemokines (IL8, CCL2, CXCL2, CXCL12, CCXL14),
and genes associated with cell death (TNFSF10, PMAIPI, AHR) and skeletal
development (GPNMB, FRZB) including transcription factors (WIF1, DLX5, TWIST1)
and growth factors (IGFBP1, -3, TGFB1) consistent with published data from human 
OA cartilage. Expression of genes related to cartilage ECM formation (COL2A1,
COL9A1, COMP, aggrecan) as well as hypertrophic bone formation (COL1A1, COL10A1) 
was predominantly found decreased. These findings indicating significant
parallels between human articular cartilage and the presented porcine micromass
model and vice versa confirm the applicability of known cartilage marker and
their characteristics in the porcine micromass model. TNF-a treatment enabled the
initiation of typical OA reaction patterns in terms of extensive ECM loss, cell
death, formation of an inflammatory environment through the induction of genes
coding for chemokines and enzymes, and the modulation of genes involved in
skeletal development such as growth factors, transcription factors, and cartilage
ECM-forming genes. In conclusion, the porcine micromass model represents an
alternative tissue platform for the evaluation of innovative substances and
techniques for the treatment of OA.

CPEB1 promotes differentiation and suppresses EMT in mammary epithelial cells.

Downregulation of CPEB1, a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein, in a mouse
mammary epithelial cell line (CID-9) causes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition 
(EMT), based on several criteria. First, CPEB1 knockdown decreases protein levels
of E-cadherin and ß-catenin but increases those of vimentin and Twist1. Second,
the motility of CPEB1-depleted cells is increased. Third, CID-9 cells normally
form growth-arrested, polarized and three-dimensional acini upon culture in
extracellular matrix, but CPEB1-deficient CID-9 cells form nonpolarized
proliferating colonies lacking a central cavity. CPEB1 downregulates Twist1
expression by binding to its mRNA, shortening its poly(A) tract and repressing
its translation. CID-9 cultures contain both myoepithelial and luminal epithelial
cells. CPEB1 increases during CID-9 cell differentiation, is predominantly
expressed in myoepithelial cells, and its knockdown prevents expression of the
myoepithelial marker p63. CPEB1 is present in proliferating subpopulations of
pure luminal epithelial cells (SCp2) and myoepithelial cells (SCg6), but its
depletion increases Twist1 only in SCg6 cells and fails to downregulate
E-cadherin in SCp2 cells. We propose that myoepithelial cells prevent EMT by
influencing the polarity and proliferation of luminal epithelial cells in a
mechanism that requires translational silencing of myoepithelial Twist1 by CPEB1.

TWIST1 expression in breast cancer cells facilitates bone metastasis formation.

The transcription factor TWIST1 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition and/or 
escape to the oncogenic-induced failsafe program, facilitating the intravasation 
of breast cancer cells in the systemic circulation and their dissemination to the
lungs. Its involvement in breast cancer bone metastasis is unknown. To address
this question, human osteotropic MDA-MB-231/B02 breast cancer cells were stably
transfected with a Tet-inducible vector encoding for TWIST1, whose expression was
specifically repressed in the presence of doxycycline (dox). The intra-arterial
inoculation of transfectants expressing TWIST1 in immunodeficient mice
substantially increased the extent of osteolytic lesions in these animals, being 
50% larger than that of animals bearing mock-transfected tumors, as determined by
radiography. This difference was accompanied by a sharp reduction of the bone
volume (indicating a higher bone destruction) and a twofold increase in the tumor
volume compared with mice bearing mock-transfected tumors, as determined by
histomorphometry. Importantly, the suppression of TWIST1 expression in
MDA-MB-231/B02 cells in the presence of dox abolished the stimulatory effect of
TWIST1 on bone metastasis formation in vivo. Additionally, examination of the
bone marrow from untreated and dox-treated animals on day 7 after tumor cell
inoculation, at which time there was no evidence of radiographic osteolytic
lesions, revealed that the number of tumor cell colonies that were recovered from
the bone marrow of untreated mice was dramatically increased compared with that
of dox-fed animals. In vitro, TWIST1 expression promoted tumor cell invasion and 
enhanced microRNA 10b (miR-10b) expression, a proinvasive factor, but was
dispensable for growth of tumor cells. In vivo, the repression of miR-10b
substantially decreased the presence of TWIST1-expressing breast cancer cells in 
the bone marrow. Overall, these results establish that TWIST1 facilitates breast 
cancer bone metastasis formation through a mechanism dependent of miR-10b, which 
leads to increase tumor burden and bone destruction.

Victoria Hospital, Belfast, UK.

The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has increased dramatically over recent
years and Barrett's esophagus is considered the most established risk factor for 
its development. Endoscopic surveillance of Barrett's esophagus is therefore
recommended but hinges on histological interpretation of randomly taken biopsies 
which is poorly reproducible. The use of biomarkers presents an opportunity to
improve our ability to risk-stratify these patients.We examined three biomarkers 
namely p504s, CD133, and Twist in the setting of Barrett's esophagus, low-grade
dysplasia, and esophageal adenocarcinoma to evaluate differential expression
between benign, dysplastic, and malignant Barrett's tissue in an exploratory
cross-sectional study. Twenty-five cases each of Barrett's esophagus, low-grade
dysplasia, and esophageal adenocarcinoma were included along-with 25 cases of
esophagectomy resections for Barrett's adenocarcinoma. The biomarkers were
immunostained on automated Ventana(®) immunostainer. The biopsies were assessed
for biomarker expression by two independent observers. Granular cytoplasmic
staining of p504s was observed in dysplastic Barrett's biopsies and esophageal
adenocarcinoma but not in Barrett's esophagus. Apical and membranous CD133
expression was also observed in dysplastic Barrett's and esophageal
adenocarcinoma. Nuclear Twist expression was seen predominantly in stromal cells.
There was increased p504s expression in dysplastic Barrett's esophagus and
esophageal adenocarcinoma compared with controls. CD133 expression was detected
for the first time in esophageal adenocarcinoma and dysplastic Barrett's
esophagus. Twist expression was not convincing enough to be labeled as Barrett's 
biomarker. p504s and CD133 have the potential to differentiate benign from
malignant Barrett's tissue in this exploratory study. Their validity should be
established in prospective longitudinal studies.

The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a highly conserved cellular
program, plays an important role in normal embryogenesis and cancer metastasis.
Twist1, a master regulator of embryonic morphogenesis, is overexpressed in breast
cancer and contributes to metastasis by promoting EMT. In exploring the mechanism
underlying the increased Twist1 in breast cancer cells, we found that the
transcription factor SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 5(Sox5) is up-regulation 
in breast cancer cells and depletion of Sox5 inhibits breast cancer cell
proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, depletion of Sox5 in breast 
cancer cells caused a dramatic decrease in Twist1 and chromosome
immunoprecipitation assay showed that Sox5 can bind directly to the Twist1
promoter, suggesting that Sox5 transactivates Twist1 expression. We further
demonstrated that knockdown of Sox5 up-regulated epithelial phenotype cell
biomarker (E-cadherin) and down-regulated mesenchymal phenotype cell biomarkers
(N-cadherin, Vimentin, and Fibronectin 1), resulting in suppression of EMT. Our
study suggests that Sox5 transactivates Twist1 expression and plays an important 
role in the regulation of breast cancer progression.

Dissemination of epithelial cells is a critical step in metastatic spread.
Molecular models of dissemination focus on loss of E-cadherin or repression of
cell adhesion through an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). We sought to
define the minimum molecular events necessary to induce dissemination of cells
out of primary murine mammary epithelium. Deletion of E-cadherin disrupted
epithelial architecture and morphogenesis but only rarely resulted in
dissemination. In contrast, expression of the EMT transcription factor Twist1
induced rapid dissemination of cytokeratin-positive epithelial cells. Twist1
induced dramatic transcriptional changes in extracellular compartment and
cell-matrix adhesion genes but not in cell-cell adhesion genes. Surprisingly, we 
observed disseminating cells with membrane-localized E-cadherin and ß-catenin,
and E-cadherin knockdown strongly inhibited Twist1-induced single cell
dissemination. Dissemination can therefore occur with retention of epithelial
cell identity. The spread of cancer cells during metastasis could similarly
involve activation of an epithelial motility program without requiring a
transition from epithelial to mesenchymal character.

OBJECTIVES: The functions of hypoxia and subsequent hypoxia-inducible factor-1a
(HIF-1a) activation in vasculogenic mimicry (VM) are currently unclear. This
study aimed to investigate the effects of hypoxia on VM formation in ovarian
cancer, and explore the possible mechanism involved.
METHODS: The expression levels of HIF-1a, E-cadherin, vimentin, Twist1, Slug, and
VE-cadherin proteins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 71 specimens of
epithelial ovarian cancer. The results were correlated with VM and survival
analysis. We used a well-established in vitro model of a three-dimensional
culture to compare VM formation under hypoxia and normoxia in ovarian cancer cell
lines SKOV3 and OVCAR3. To explore the potential mechanism, we examined the
effects of hypoxia on the mRNA and protein expression levels of both E-cadherin
and vimentin.
RESULTS: HIF-1a expression was correlated with loss of E-cadherin expression and 
up-regulated vimentin expression in 11 of the 18 VM-positive patients. Ovarian
cancer with evidence of VM was significantly more likely to have high Twist1,
Slug, and VE-cadherin expression levels. VM was observed in vitro under hypoxia. 
The ovarian cancer cells presented morphological epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT)-like changes (more fibroblastoid morphology and loss of cellular
cohesiveness) under hypoxic conditions. The mRNA and protein levels demonstrated 
the induction of EMT after hypoxia. Clinicopathological analysis revealed that
both VM and HIF-1a expression levels presented shorter survival durations.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxia contributed to VM formation by inducing EMT. These results
may offer new insights for consideration in ovarian cancer treatment strategies.

Craniosynostosis (CS) is a relatively common birth defect resulting from the
premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures. Human genetic studies have
identified several genes in association with CS. One such gene that has been
implicated in both syndromic (Saethre-Chotzen syndrome) and nonsyndromic forms of
CS in humans is TWIST1. In this study, a heterozygous Twist1 knock out
(Twist1(+/-) ) mouse model was used to study the craniofacial shape changes
associated with the partial loss of function. A geometric morphometric approach
was used to analyze landmark data derived from microcomputed tomography scans to 
compare craniofacial shape between 17 Twist1(+/-) mice and 26 of their
Twist1(+/+) (wild type) littermate controls at 15 days of age. The results show
that despite the purported wide variation in synostotic severity, Twist1(+/-)
mice have a consistent pattern of craniofacial dysmorphology affecting all major 
regions of the skull. Similar to Saethre-Chotzen, the calvarium is acrocephalic
and wide with an overall brachycephalic shape. Mutant mice also exhibited a
shortened cranial base and a wider and shorted face, consistent with coronal CS
associated phenotypes. The results suggest that these differences are at least
partially the direct result of the Twist1 haploinsufficiency on the developing
craniofacial skeleton. This study provides a quantitative phenotype complement to
the developmental and molecular genetic research previously done on Twist1. These
results can be used to generate further hypotheses about the effect of Twist1 and
premature suture fusion on the entire craniofacial skeleton.

DNA methylation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) represents a frequent and early 
epigenetic event with potential applications for cancer detection and disease
evolution. Our aim was to examine the stratification and prognostic biomarker
role of the methylation of a novel panel of TSGs in bladder cancer. The
methylation status of 18 TSGs was evaluated in bladder cancer cells (n=14) and
paraffin-embedded primary bladder tumors (n=61), using a methylation-specific
multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay (MS-MLPA). Recurrence,
progression, and disease-specific survival were analyzed using univariate and
multivariate Cox models. PRDM2, HLTF, ID4, DLC1, BNIP3, H2AFX, CACNA1G, TGIF, and
CACNA1A were discovered methylated in bladder cancer. The methylation of RUNX3
(p=0.026), TWIST1 (p=0.009), SFRP4 (p=0.002), and CCND2 (p=0.027) correlated to
tumor stage. Univariate analyses indicated prognostic associations for recurrence
(DLC1, SFRP5, H2AFX, CACNA1G), progression (DLC1, SFRP5, CACNA1G),
disease-specific (PRDM2, DLC1, SFRP5, CACNA1G, and TIMP3), and overall survival
(SFRP5 and TIMP3). In multivariate analyses, several TSGs remained as independent
prognosticators for recurrence (SFRP5, H2AFX), progression (CACNA1G), and
disease-specific survival (SFRP5). Thus, a novel set of TSGs was identified,
frequently methylated in bladder cancer cells and tumors. TSG methylation allowed
histopathologic and outcome stratification using paraffin-embedded tumors. This
is clinically relevant by offering a strategy for the management of patients
affected with uroepithelial neoplasias in pathology routine laboratories.

cell lung cancer cells.

BACKGROUND: mTOR, which can form mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) or mTOR Complex 2
(mTORC2) depending on its binding partners, is frequently deregulated in the
pulmonary neoplastic conditions and interstitial lung diseases of the patients
treated with rapalogs. In this study, we investigated the relationship between
mTOR signaling and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) by dissecting mTOR
pathways.
METHODS: Components of mTOR signaling pathway were silenced by shRNA in a panel
of non-small cell lung cancer cell lines and protein expression of epithelial and
mesenchymal markers were evaluated by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry.
mRNA level of the E-cadherin repressor complexes were evaluated by qRT-PCR.
RESULTS: IGF-1 treatment decreased expression of the E-cadherin and rapamycin
increased its expression, suggesting hyperactivation of mTOR signaling relates to
the loss of E-cadherin. Genetic ablation of rapamycin-insensitive companion of
mTOR (Rictor), a component of mTORC2, did not influence E-cadherin expression,
whereas genetic ablation of regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor), a
component of mTORC1, led to a decrease in E-cadherin expression at the mRNA
level. Increased phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 and GSK-3ß at Ser9 were
observed in the Raptor-silenced NSCLC cells. Of the E-cadherin repressor
complexes tested, Snail, Zeb2, and Twist1 mRNAs were elevated in raptor-silenced 
A549 cells, and Zeb2 and Twist1 mRNAs were elevated in Raptor-silenced H2009
cells. These findings were recapitulated by treatment with the GSK-3ß inhibitor, 
LiCl. Raptor knockdown A549 cells showed increased expression of N-cadherin and
vimentin with mesenchymal phenotypic changes.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, selective inhibition of mTORC1 leads to
hyperactivation of the AKT/GSK-3ß pathway, inducing E-cadherin repressor
complexes and EMT. These findings imply the existence of a feedback inhibition
loop of mTORC1 onto mTORC2 that plays a role in the homeostasis of E-cadherin
expression and EMT, requiring caution in the clinical use of rapalog and
selective mTORC1 inhibitors.

Neural crest cells are specified at the border between the neural plate and the
epiderm. They are capable of differentiating into various somatic cell types,
including craniofacial and peripheral nerve tissues. Notch signaling plays
important roles during neurogenesis; however, its function during human neural
crest development is poorly understood. Here, we generated self-renewing
premigratory neural-crest-like cells (pNCCs) from human pluripotent stem cells
(hPSCs) and investigated the roles of Notch signaling during neural crest
differentiation. pNCCs expressed various neural-crest-specifier genes, including 
SLUG (also known as SNAI2), SOX10 and TWIST1, and were able to differentiate into
most neural crest derivatives. Blocking Notch signaling during the pNCC
differentiation suppressed the expression of neural-crest-specifier genes. By
contrast, ectopic expression of activated Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD1)
augmented the expression of neural-crest-specifier genes, and NICD1 was found to 
bind to their promoter regions. Notch activity was also required for the
maintenance of the premigratory neural crest state, and the suppression of Notch 
signaling led to the generation of neural-crest-derived neurons. Taken together, 
we provide a protocol for the generation of pNCCs and show that Notch signaling
regulates the formation, migration and differentiation of neural crest from
hPSCs.

Craniosynostosis is caused by premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures
leading to deformity of the cranium. Depending on the type and number of the
sutures involved and the order of their fusion, different forms of deformities
may develop. Two main types of craniosynostosis can be distinguished:
non-syndromic (isolated) and syndromic forms. In the latter group the cranial
deformity is usually associated with dysmorphic features, limb anomalies and
other symptoms while in non-syndromic form the cranial deformity can be seen
only. The type and severity of associated anomalies in the syndromic form are
different. Early fusion of sutures can be caused by both environmental and
genetic factors. In the present paper the authors aim to review the clinical
features and genetic background of craniosynostosis focusing on some common
syndromes.

Twist is a key transcription activator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT). It remains unclear how Twist induces gene expression. Here we report a
mechanism by which Twist recruits BRD4 to direct WNT5A expression in basal-like
breast cancer (BLBC). Twist contains a "histone H4-mimic" GK-X-GK motif that is
diacetylated by Tip60. The diacetylated Twist binds the second bromodomain of
BRD4, whose first bromodomain interacts with acetylated H4, thereby constructing 
an activated Twist/BRD4/P-TEFb/RNA-Pol II complex at the WNT5A promoter and
enhancer. Pharmacologic inhibition of the Twist-BRD4 association reduced WNT5A
expression and suppressed invasion, cancer stem cell (CSC)-like properties, and
tumorigenicity of BLBC cells. Our study indicates that the interaction with BRD4 
is critical for the oncogenic function of Twist in BLBC.

OBJECTIVE: Testing for high risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is increasing;
however due to limitations in specificity there remains a need for better triage 
tests. Research efforts have focused recently on methylation of human genes which
show promise as diagnostic classifiers.
METHODS: Methylation of 26 genes: APC, CADM1, CCND2, CDH13, CDKN2A, CTNNB1,
DAPK1, DPYS, EDNRB, EPB41L3, ESR1, GSTP1, HIN1, JAM3, LMX1, MAL, MDR1, PAX1,
PTGS2, RARB, RASSF1, SLIT2, SOX1, SPARC, TERT and TWIST1 was measured by
pyrosequencing in cytology specimens from a pilot set of women with normal or
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) histology. Six genes were
selected for testing in Predictors 1, a colposcopy referral study comprising 799 
women. The three genes EPB41L3, DPYS and MAL were further tested in a second
colposcopy referral study, Predictors 2, comprising 884 women.
RESULTS: The six genes selected from the pilot: EPB41L3, EDNRB, LMX1, DPYS, MAL
and CADM1 showed significantly elevated methylation in CIN2 and CIN3 (CIN2/3)
versus =CIN1 in Predictors 1 (p<0.01). Highest methylation was observed in cancer
tissues. EPB41L3 methylation was the best single classifier of CIN2/3 in both
HR-HPV positive (p<0.0001) and negative samples (p=0.02). Logistic regression
modeling showed that other genes did not add significantly to EPB41L3 and in
Predictors 2, its classifier value was validated with AUC 0.69 (95% CI
0.65-0.73).
CONCLUSION: Several methylated genes show promise for detecting CIN2/3 of which
EPB41L3 seems the best. Methylated human gene biomarkers used in combination may 
be clinically useful for triage of women with HR-HPV infections.

In the present study, we isolated and screened an antitumor polysaccharide
(PGP2a) from the roots of Panax ginseng. Chemical composition analysis indicated 
PGP2a was an acidic protein-polysaccharide. The average molecular weight was
estimated to be 3.2 × 10(4)Da. According to gas chromatography (GC) result, PGP2a
consisted of galactose, arabinose, glucose and galacturonic acid in the molar
ratio of 3.7:1.6:0.5:5.4, respectively. MTT assay showed that PGP2a had a potent 
inhibitory effect on the growth of HGC-27 cells in a dose-dependent fashion.
Furthermore, the number of HGC-27 cells arrested in G2/M phase, and the
percentage of apoptotic cells were increased in response to PGP2a treatment along
with concentration increasing. Moreover, western blotting analysis showed that
protein expressions of Twist and AKR1C2 were suppressed by PGP2a, whereas an
increase of NF1 was observed at protein level. Taken together, these findings
suggested that PGP2a could be developed as a novel antitumor agent acting on
Twist related gene for human gastric cancer therapy.

Clusterin (CLU) is cytoprotective molecular chaperone that is highly expressed in
castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). CRPC is also characterized by
increased insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I responsiveness which induces
prostate cancer survival and CLU expression. However, how IGF-I induces CLU
expression and whether CLU is required for IGF-mediated growth signaling remain
unknown. Here we show that IGF-I induced CLU via STAT3-Twist1 signaling pathway. 
In response to IGF-I, STAT3 was phosphorylated, translocated to the nucleus and
bound to the Twist1 promoter to activate Twist1 transcription. In turn, Twist1
bound to E-boxes on the CLU promoter and activated CLU transcription. Inversely, 
we demonstrated that knocking down Twist1 abrogated IGF-I induced CLU expression,
indicating that Twist1 mediated IGF-I-induced CLU expression. When PTEN knockout 
mice were crossed with lit/lit mice, the resultant IGF-I deficiency suppressed
Twist1 as well as CLU gene expression in mouse prostate glands. Moreover, both
Twist1 and CLU knockdown suppressed prostate cancer growth accelerated by IGF-I, 
suggesting the relevance of this signaling not only in an in vitro, but also in
an in vivo. Collectively, this study indicates that IGF-I induces CLU expression 
through sequential activation of STAT3 and Twist1, and suggests that this
signaling cascade plays a critical role in prostate cancer pathogenesis.

Prostate cancer (PCa) metastasis to bone is lethal and there is no adequate
animal model for studying the mechanisms underlying the metastatic process. Here,
we report that receptor activator of NF-<U+03BA>B ligand (RANKL) expressed by PCa cells 
consistently induced colonization or metastasis to bone in animal models.
RANK-mediated signaling established a premetastatic niche through a feed-forward 
loop, involving the induction of RANKL and c-Met, but repression of androgen
receptor (AR) expression and AR signaling pathways. Site-directed mutagenesis and
transcription factor (TF) deletion/interference assays identified common TF
complexes, c-Myc/Max, and AP4 as critical regulatory nodes. RANKL-RANK signaling 
activated a number of master regulator TFs that control the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (Twist1, Slug, Zeb1, and Zeb2), stem cell
properties (Sox2, Myc, Oct3/4, and Nanog), neuroendocrine differentiation (Sox9, 
HIF1a, and FoxA2), and osteomimicry (c-Myc/Max, Sox2, Sox9, HIF1a, and Runx2).
Abrogating RANK or its downstream c-Myc/Max or c-Met signaling network minimized 
or abolished skeletal metastasis in mice. RANKL-expressing LNCaP cells recruited 
and induced neighboring non metastatic LNCaP cells to express RANKL,
c-Met/activated c-Met, while downregulating AR expression. These initially
non-metastatic cells, once retrieved from the tumors, acquired the potential to
colonize and grow in bone. These findings identify a novel mechanism of tumor
growth in bone that involves tumor cell reprogramming via RANK-RANKL signaling,
as well as a form of signal amplification that mediates recruitment and stable
transformation of non-metastatic bystander dormant cells.

BACKGROUND: Supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor (sPNET) is a malignant
brain tumor with poor prognosis. New model systems that replicate sPNET's
molecular subtype(s) and maintain cancer stem cell (CSC) pool are needed.
METHODS: A fresh surgical specimen of a pediatric sPNET was directly injected
into the right cerebrum of Rag2/SCID mice. The xenograft tumors were serially
sub-transplanted in mouse brains, characterized histopathologically, and
subclassified into molecular subtype through qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical
analysis. CSCs were identified through flow cytometric profiling of putative CSC 
markers (CD133, CD15, CD24, CD44, and CD117), functional examination of
neurosphere forming efficiency in vitro, and tumor formation capacity in vivo. To
establish a neurosphere line, neurospheres were propagated in serum-free medium.
RESULTS: Formation of intracerebral xenograft tumors was confirmed in 4 of the 5 
mice injected with the patient tumor. These xenograft tumors were
sub-transplanted in vivo 5 times. They replicated the histopathological features 
of the original patient tumor and expressed the molecular markers (TWIST1 and
FOXJ1) of group 3 sPNET. CD133(+) and CD15(+) cells were found to have strong
neurosphere-forming efficiency in vitro and potent tumor-forming capacity (with
as few as 100 cells) in vivo. A neurosphere line BXD-2664PNET-NS was established 
that preserved stem cell features and expressed group 3 markers.
CONCLUSION: We have established a group 3 sPNET xenograft mouse model
(IC-2664PNET) with matching neurosphere line (BXD-2664PNET-NS) and identified
CD133(+) and CD15(+) cells as the major CSC subpopulations. This novel model
system should facilitate biological studies and preclinical drug screenings for
childhood sPNET.

The FERM domain containing protein Kindlin-3 has been recognized as a major
regulator of integrin function in hematopoietic cells, but its role in neoplasia 
is totally unknown. We have examined the relationship between Kindlin-3 and
breast cancer in mouse models and human tissues. Human breast tumors showed a
~7-fold elevation in Kindlin-3 mRNA compared with nonneoplastic tissue by
quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Kindlin-3 overexpression in a breast
cancer cell line increased primary tumor growth and lung metastasis by 2.5- and
3-fold, respectively, when implanted into mice compared with cells expressing
vector alone. Mechanistically, the Kindlin-3-overexpressing cells displayed a
2.2-fold increase in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion and
enhanced ß1 integrin activation. Increased VEGF secretion resulted from enhanced 
production of Twist, a transcription factor that promotes tumor angiogenesis.
Knockdown of Twist diminished VEGF production, and knockdown of ß1 integrins
diminished Twist and VEGF production by Kindlin-3-overexpressing cells, while
nontargeting small interfering RNA had no effect on expression of these gene
products. Thus, Kindlin-3 influences breast cancer progression by influencing the
crosstalk between ß1 integrins and Twist to increase VEGF production. This
signaling cascade enhances breast cancer cell invasion and tumor angiogenesis and
metastasis.

miR-33a is up-regulated in chemoresistant osteosarcoma and promotes osteosarcoma 
cell resistance to cisplatin by down-regulating TWIST.

BACKGROUND: miRNAs are involved in osteosarcoma (OS) chemoresistance, and TWIST
reportedly enhances cisplatin-induced OS cell apoptosis by inhibiting multiple
signaling pathways. In this study, we profiled miRNAs differentially expressed in
chemoresistant OS, with a focus to identify miRNAs that regulate TWIST expression
and OS chemoresistance.
METHODS: OS patients who showed <90% tumor necrosis after neochemotherapy were
defined as poor responders (chemoresistant), and those who showed =90% tumor
necrosis were defined as good responders (control). miRNA microarray analysis was
carried out with a discovery cohort (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>12) of age-, sex- and tumor
stage-matched chemoresistant and control OS patients.
RESULTS: Among the up-regulated miRNAs in chemoresistant OS samples, miR-33a was 
verified to down-regulate TWIST expression, which was supported by an inverse
miRNA-33a/TWIST expression trend in the validation cohort (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>70),
target-sequence-specific inhibition of TWIST-3' untranslated region-luciferase
reporter activity by miR-33a, and alteration of TWIST expression by
overexpression or inhibition of miR-33a in human OS cell lines. In Saos-2 cells
treated with cisplatin, inhibition of miR-33a by antagomir-33a markedly increased
cell apoptosis, which was enhanced by overexpression of TWIST. The
apoptosis-inducing effect of TWIST overexpression was reversed by overexpression 
of miR-33a. In MG-63 cells, overexpression of miR-33a significantly decreased
cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis, which was enhanced by knockdown of TWIST.
Antagomir-33a significantly increased cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis, which was
reversed by knockdown of TWIST.
CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated in this study that miR-33a is up-regulated in
chemoresistant OS and that the miR-33a level is negatively correlated with the
TWIST protein level in OS. Our in vitro data indicate that miR-33a promotes OS
cell resistance to cisplatin by down-regulating TWIST; on the other hand,
inhibition of miR-33a by antagomir-33a enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis in OS
cells by up-regulating TWIST expression. The findings suggest that inhibition of 
miR-33a/TWIST signaling could be a potential new strategy to enhance neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy for OS.

Clinical significance of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated markers in 
malignant pleural mesothelioma.

Epithelioid tumors with aggressive behavior have been reported; however, the
epithelioid type of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) has a less aggressive
behavior. Few studies have evaluated the prognostic value of
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in MPM. We hypothesized that
mesenchymal characteristics might predominate in the tumors. Tumor specimens were
collected from 33 consecutive patients. We analyzed the EMT expression levels in 
tumor samples by an immunohistochemical analysis. Positive expression of
E-cadherin, <U+03B3>-catenin, vimentin, fibronectin, Twist and YB-1 was observed in 25, 
14, 21, 1, 19 and 18 patients, respectively. No significant association between
these markers and the clinicopathological characteristics was found. <U+03B3>-Catenin
demonstrated a trend towards decreased expression in sarcomatoid tumors compared 
to epithelioid tumors. On the other hand, a trend was noted towards higher
expression of vimentin, Twist and YB-1 in sarcomatoid tumors. The survival curves
demonstrated that the patients with negative <U+03B3>-catenin and positive Twist
staining had a tendency to have a worse prognosis. Although the individual
proteins might not significantly affect the progression of MPM, the combination
of <U+03B3>-catenin and Twist staining can predict the prognosis of patients with MPM.

Author information: 
(1)From the Departments of *Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, and
Neurosurgery, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA.

BACKGROUND: Most types of craniosynostosis cause predictable changes in cranial
shape. However, the phenotype of combined metopic and unilateral coronal
synostoses is anomalous. The purpose of this observational study was to better
clarify the clinical and radiographic features of this rare entity.
METHODS: A retrospective review of a craniofacial database was performed.
Patients with combined metopic and unilateral coronal synostoses were included in
this study. Data collected included demographic information, physical and
radiographic findings, genetic evaluation, treatment, and operative outcomes.
RESULTS: Of 687 patients treated between 1989 and 2010, only 3 patients had
combined metopic and unilateral coronal synostoses. All patients were diagnosed
through computed tomography on the first day of life. Phenotypic features
included the following: (1) narrowed forehead with a prominent midline ridge, (2)
severe bilateral brow retrusion with an acute indentation on the side of the
patient coronal suture, (3) facial and nasal angulation similar to isolated
unilateral coronal synostosis, and (4) anterior displacement of the ear on the
fused side. In addition, the cranial vertex was deviated toward the side of the
open coronal suture. Two patients had a head circumference below the 25th
percentile; 2 of the 3 had a TWIST gene mutation consistent with Saethre-Chotzen 
syndrome. One patient was managed through fronto-orbital advancement and required
a revision. The other 2 patients had early endoscopic release, followed by
postoperative helmet therapy; one improved but still required open cranial
remodeling. The other has near-normal phenotype, and no further surgery is
planned.
CONCLUSIONS: Combined metopic and unilateral coronal synostoses present a rare
and unusual phenotype. Although early intervention improves the deformity,
revisional procedures are usually required.

BVES inhibition triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human
hepatocellular carcinoma.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Metastasis contributes to the poor prognosis of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanism through which a primary HCC cell develops
into a metastatic phenotype is not well understood. In this study, we set out to 
elucidate how blood vessel epicardial substance (BVES), a novel adhesion molecule
regulating tight junction formation, mediates invasion and metastasis in human
HCC cells.
METHODS: qRT-PCR, western blot and IHC were used to detect the expression of BVES
in HCC samples and HCC cell lines. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against human 
BVES were synthesized and used to transfect Huh7 cells. Then, the interference
efficiency and the expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin and epithelial
marker E-cadherin were measured by qRT-PCR and western blot. F-actin cytoskeleton
was detected using TRITC-conjugated phalloidin. After inhibition of BVES, wound
healing experiment and transwell assay were used to analyze the migratory and
invasive ability of Huh7 cells.
RESULTS: BVES was down-regulated in human HCC tissues and HCC cell lines with
high metastatic potential. After BVES inhibition, Huh7 cells exhibited some
morphological changes including cytoskeleton rearrangement and junctional
disruption. Cell migration and invasion were increased concomitant with increased
expression of vimentin, IL-6, MMP2, MMP9 and decreased expression of E-cadherin. 
Finally, we found the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
transcription factors Snail1 and Twist1 was significantly increased in BVES
knockdown cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that down-regulation of BVES in HCC induces EMT,
thus promoting invasion and metastasis in HCC cells.

Medicine, Konyang University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.

BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been known to induce
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and prostate cancer cell progression.
However, a detailed underlying mechanism by which EGF induces EMT and prostate
cancer cell progression remained to be answered. Hypoxia-inducible factor
(HIF)-1a and TWIST1 are transcription factors implicated in EMT and cancer
metastasis. The purpose of this study is to determine the underlying mechanism of
EGF-induced TWIST1 expression and prostate cancer invasion.
METHODS: siRNAs were used to silence genes. Immunoblotting, quantitative RT-PCR
and immunofluorescence analysis were used to examine protein or mRNA expression. 
Modified Boyden chamber and invasion assay kit with Matrigel-coated inserts were 
used to determine prostate cancer cell migration and invasion, respectively.
RESULTS: We observed that EGF induced HIF-1a expression and morphological change 
of prostate cancer epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells. Silencing HIF-1a
expression dramatically reduced EGF-induced TWIST1 expression and prostate cancer
cell EMT. Conversely, transfection of the cells with HIF-1a siRNA reversed the
reduced E-cadherin expression by EGF. Pretreatment of the cells with
pharmacological inhibitors of reactive oxygen species [ROS, N-acetylcysteine
(NAC)] and STAT3 (WP1066) but not p38 MAPK (SB203580) significantly reduced
EGF-induced HIF-1a mRNA and protein expression. Further, pretreatment of the
cells with NAC attenuated EGF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. In addition, we
showed that TWIST1 mediated EGF-induced N-cadherin expression, leading to
prostate cancer invasion.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a mechanism by which EGF promotes prostate cancer
cell progression through a ROS/STAT3/HIF-1a/TWIST1/N-cadherin signaling cascade, 
providing novel biomarkers and promising therapeutic targets for prostate cancer 
cell progression.

Tumor cell invasion is a major contributor to cancer morbidity, and is of
particular importance in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the highest
grade and most aggressive primary brain tumor. Tumor cell invasion and the
expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are required for GBM
invasion, are enhanced by inhibitor of DNA binding (Id) gene family members, Id1,
Id2 and Id3, which can be highly expressed in glioma. Id4 is expressed in GBM at 
more variable levels than these other family members and we sought to determine
its role in invasion. We found, unexpectedly, that invasion was dramatically
inhibited in cells expressing Id4 as a result of decreased MMP2, a secreted
proteinase key for brain tumor invasion. We demonstrate that Id4 decreased MMP2
expression by a direct inhibitory interaction with Twist1, a basic
helix-loop-helix transcription factor known to increase MMP2 expression.
Importantly, using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we show that Id4 expression
correlates with survival of glioblastoma patients and inversely correlates with
MMP2 expression. These data suggest that the upregulation of MMP2 resulting from 
decreased Id4 expression in GBM may contribute to the morbidity and mortality of 
GBM patients.

Since its discovery in biopsies from breast cancer patients, the effect of
corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) on carcinoma progression is still unclear. 
Transforming growth factorß1 (TGFß1) promotes Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition
(EMT) and induces Snail1 and Twist1 expressions. Loss of epithelial cadherin
(E-cadherin) mainly repressed by Snail1 and Twist1, has been considered as
hallmark of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). Two breast cancer cell
lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were used to investigate the effect of CRH on
TGFß1-induced EMT by transwell chamber. And HEK293 cells were transiently
transfected with CRHR1 or CRHR2 to explore the definite effects of CRH receptor. 
We reported that CRH inhibited migration of human breast cancer cells through
downregulation of Snail1 and Twist1, and subsequent upregulation of E-cadherin.
CRH inhibited TGFß1-mediated migration of MCF-7 via both CRHR1 and CRHR2 while
this inhibition in MDA-MB-231 was mainly via CRHR2. Ectopic re-expression of
CRHR1 or CRHR2 respectively in HEK293 cells increased E-cadherin expression after
CRH stimulation. Furthermore, CRH repressed expression of mesenchymal marker,
N-cadherin and induced expression of Occludin, inhibiting EMT in MCF-7 &
MDA-MB-231. Our results suggest that CRH may function as a tumor suppressor, at
least partly by regulating TGFß1-mediated EMT. These results may contribute to
uncovering the effect of CRH in breast tumorigenesis and progression.

Prostaglandin E2 inhibits in-vitro mineral deposition by human periodontal
ligament cells via modulating the expression of TWIST1 and RUNX2.

University, Bangkok, Thailand.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been shown to be able to
influence both bone formation and resorption. The purpose of this study was to
investigate the effect of PGE2 on the osteogenic differentiation of human
periodontal ligament (HPDL) cells.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: HPDL cells were cultured with 0.001-1 µm PGE2 in osteogenic
medium. In-vitro mineral deposition was determined by Alizarin Red S staining,
and gene expression was determined by real-time PCR.
RESULTS: PGE2 inhibited in-vitro mineral deposition by HPDL cells in a
dose-dependent manner. PCR analyses showed that PGE2 upregulated the expression
of Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), but had no effect on osteocalcin 
expression. Upregulation of TWIST-related protein1 (TWIST1), a functional
antagonist of RUNX2, was also observed. In addition, increased levels of RUNX2
and TWIST1 proteins, induced by PGE2, were detected by western blot analysis.
Using a chemical activator of E prostanoid (EP) receptors as well as small
interfering RNA against an EP receptor, it was shown that PGE2 regulated RUNX2
and TWIST1 via the EP2 receptor. The role of protein kinase A in the inductive
effect of PGE2 was also demonstrated.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study revealed that PGE2 modulates the osteogenic
differentiation of HPDL cells via regulating the expression of RUNX2 and TWIST1. 
The results suggest a possible role for PGE2 in regulating the homeostasis of
periodontal ligament tissue.

Bioinformatic analysis of Msx1 and Msx2 involved in craniofacial development.

People's Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine,Shanghai Key
Laboratory of Stomatology, Shanghai; and Emergency Department and Department of
Orthopaedics, the First People's Hospital of Lian Yun Gang, Lianyungang, China.

Msx1 and Msx2 were revealed to be candidate genes for some craniofacial
deformities, such as cleft lip with/without cleft palate (CL/P) and
craniosynostosis. Many other genes were demonstrated to have a cross-talk with
MSX genes in causing these defects. However, there is no systematic evaluation
for these MSX gene-related factors. In this study, we performed systematic
bioinformatic analysis for MSX genes by combining using GeneDecks, DAVID, and
STRING database, and the results showed that there were numerous genes related to
MSX genes, such as Irf6, TP63, Dlx2, Dlx5, Pax3, Pax9, Bmp4, Tgf-beta2, and
Tgf-beta3 that have been demonstrated to be involved in CL/P, and Fgfr2, Fgfr1,
Fgfr3, and Twist1 that were involved in craniosynostosis. Many of these genes
could be enriched into different gene groups involved in different signaling
ways, different craniofacial deformities, and different biological process. These
findings could make us analyze the function of MSX gens in a gene network. In
addition, our findings showed that Sumo, a novel gene whose polymorphisms were
demonstrated to be associated with nonsyndromic CL/P by genome-wide association
study, has protein-protein interaction with MSX1, which may offer us an
alternative method to perform bioinformatic analysis for genes found by
genome-wide association study and can make us predict the disrupted protein
function due to the mutation in a gene DNA sequence. These findings may guide us 
to perform further functional studies in the future.

Cervical carcinoma is associated with high propensity for local invasion and
lymph node metastasis. However, the molecular alterations that drive progression 
and metastasis of cervical cancer remain unclear. Cellular senescence has been
proposed as the mechanism that protects an organism against cancer progression
and metastasis. In addition, Twist, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription
factor, has been suggested as an oncogene because it is overexpressed in many
types of human cancer. This gene also exhibits a positive function in regulating 
invasion and metastasis. In this study, Twist was strongly and positively
expressed in normal tissue, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) IA-IIA, and SCC
IIB-IIIB (4.3%, 44%, and 88.9%, respectively). The strong positive expressions of
the senescence marker CBX3 were 39.1%, 32%, and 15.6%, respectively. The strong
positive expressions of Twist in the SCC groups with or without lymph node
metastasis were 80.8% and 50%. For CBX3, such expressions were 7.7% and 29.5%,
respectively. Results also showed that the expression of Twist was inversely
correlated with that of CBX3. Moreover, the knockdown of Twist with target siRNA 
in SiHa triggered the induction of the chromatin marker of the cellular
senescence CBX3 and senescence-associated ß-galactosidase activity. Our results
suggested that the expression of Twist increased during the progression and
metastasis of cervical cancer. Furthermore, Twist-induced senescence bypass is
important in this process.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important factor in cancer
invasiveness and metastatic progression. During EMT, cancer cells acquire stem
cell properties. The role of EMT and stemness in colon cancer has not been fully 
understood. We aimed to demonstrate the clinical significance of EMT and the stem
cell phenotype in colorectal cancer. Two hundred and thirty-one surgically
resected colon cancer cases were included in the present study. mRNAs of
E-cadherin, TWIST1 and SNAI1 were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (n=109). Immunohistochemical staining was performed for 
six markers (ALDH1, TGF-ß1, E-cadherin, ß-catenin, TWSIT1 and SNAI1) (n=231). We 
assessed clinicopathological characteristics according to the expression of the
stem cell phenotype and EMT markers. Based on the results of qRT-PCR, TWIST1 and 
SNAI1 significantly influenced node metastasis (P=0.04 and P=0.02, respectively).
High TWIST1 and SNAI1 mRNA expression was associated with poor overall survival
according to the univariate analysis (P<0.01 and P=0.01, respectively) and the
multivariate analysis (P=0.04 and P=0.04, respectively). ALDH1 expression as
detected by immunohistochemical staining was associated with high nodal stage,
advanced clinical stage, lymphatic invasion and poor survival (P=0.01, P=0.04,
P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively) and with the expression of TGF-ß1 and ß-catenin.
In conclusion, in human colorectal cancer, the EMT markers TWIST1 and SNAI1 are
suggested as important markers of poor prognosis. Their expression is associated 
with the expression of putative stem cell marker ALDH1, and ALDH1 is associated
with the expression of TGF-ß1.

Human epithelial cells undergo morphological and molecular changes leading to
terminal differentiation and replicative senescence after a finite number of cell
divisions during serial subculture. However, the target genes and their
functional significance in the senescence and differentiation in normal human
oral keratinocytes have been poorly defined. Here, we demonstrated normal human
oral keratinocytes transcriptional signature profiling to senescence and
differentiation. Using microarray analysis, our findings indicated that the gene 
expression profiles induced by serial subculture are distinct classes of gene.
The greatest number of these altered genes was identified as being related to
biological pathways of transport, cell proliferation, cell cycle, defense and
immune response, cell death, transcription, apoptosis, and inflammatory response,
suggesting that the serial subculture is able to induce a multitude of specific
gene expression changes during senescence and differentiation. Several highly
upregulated genes (IL-1ß, S100A8, S100A9, MMP1, MMP9, IL-8, BHLHB2, HES1, and
TWIST1) in response to the serial subculture in normal human oral keratinocytes
were observed. In vitro and in vivo studies also exhibited a close relationship
between senescence and differentiation of primary oral keratinocytes and
expression of inflammatory molecules. These results suggest a new approach to
determine the biological events underlying the pathogenesis of oral keratinocyte 
aging.

Identification of key regulators for the migration and invasion of rheumatoid
synoviocytes through a systems approach.

Rheumatoid synoviocytes, which consist of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) and
synovial macrophages (SMs), are crucial for the progression of rheumatoid
arthritis (RA). Particularly, FLSs of RA patients (RA-FLSs) exhibit invasive
characteristics reminiscent of cancer cells, destroying cartilage and bone.
RA-FLSs and SMs originate differently from mesenchymal and myeloid cells,
respectively, but share many pathologic functions. However, the molecular
signatures and biological networks representing the distinct and shared features 
of the two cell types are unknown. We performed global transcriptome profiling of
FLSs and SMs obtained from RA and osteoarthritis patients. By comparing the
transcriptomes, we identified distinct molecular signatures and cellular
processes defining invasiveness of RA-FLSs and proinflammatory properties of
RA-SMs, respectively. Interestingly, under the interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß)-stimulated 
condition, the RA-FLSs newly acquired proinflammatory signature dominant in
RA-SMs without losing invasive properties. We next reconstructed a network model 
that delineates the shared, RA-FLS-dominant (invasive), and RA-SM-dominant
(inflammatory) processes. From the network model, we selected 13 genes, including
periostin, osteoblast-specific factor (POSTN) and twist basic helix-loop-helix
transcription factor 1 (TWIST1), as key regulator candidates responsible for FLS 
invasiveness. Of note, POSTN and TWIST1 expressions were elevated in independent 
RA-FLSs and further instigated by IL-1ß. Functional assays demonstrated the
requirement of POSTN and TWIST1 for migration and invasion of RA-FLSs stimulated 
with IL-1ß. Together, our systems approach to rheumatoid synovitis provides a
basis for identifying key regulators responsible for pathological features of
RA-FLSs and -SMs, demonstrating how a certain type of cells acquires functional
redundancy under chronic inflammatory conditions.

The establishment of lethal metastases depends on the capacity of a small number 
of cancer cells to regenerate a tumor after entering a target organ. Stankic and 
colleagues have identified a role for the inhibitor of differentiation protein,
ID1, as a critical regulator of breast cancer stem-like properties and metastatic
colonization. Under the control of tumor growth factor-beta signaling, ID1
induces mesenchymal-epithelial transition at the metastatic site by antagonizing 
the activity of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist1. This
study sheds light on mechanisms that initiate metastatic outgrowth, and
strengthens the concept that epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity is crucial at
different stages of metastasis.

Although the kinase receptor TrkA may play an important role in acute myeloid
leukemia (AML), its involvement in other types of leukemia has not been reported.
Furthermore, how it contributes to leukemogenesis is unknown. Here, we describe a
molecular network that is important for TrkA function in leukemogenesis. We found
that TrkA is frequently overexpressed in other types of leukemia such as acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) including AML. In addition, TrkA was overexpressed
in patients with MDS or secondary AML evolving from MDS. TrkA induced significant
hematological malignancies by inducing PLK-1 and Twist-1, and enhanced survival
and proliferation of leukemia, which was correlated with activation of the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR pathway. Moreover, endogenous TrkA
associated with c-Src complexes was detected in leukemia. Suppression of c-Src
activation by TrkA resulted in markedly decreased expression of PLK-1 and Twist-1
via suppressed activation of Akt/mTOR cascades. These data suggest that TrkA
plays a key role in leukemogenesis and reveal an unexpected physiological role
for TrkA in the pathogenesis of leukemia. These data have important implications 
for understanding various hematological malignancies.

Architecture of epigenetic reprogramming following Twist1-mediated
epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

Yamazaki J, Raynal NJ, Long H, Tahara T, Tinnirello A, Ramachandran P, Zhang XY, 
Liang S, Mani SA, Issa JP.

BACKGROUND: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is known to impart metastasis
and stemness characteristics in breast cancer. To characterize the epigenetic
reprogramming following Twist1-induced EMT, we characterized the epigenetic and
transcriptome landscapes using whole-genome transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq,
DNA methylation by digital restriction enzyme analysis of methylation (DREAM) and
histone modifications by CHIP-seq of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in immortalized human
mammary epithelial cells relative to cells induced to undergo EMT by Twist1.
RESULTS: EMT is accompanied by focal hypermethylation and widespread global DNA
hypomethylation, predominantly within transcriptionally repressed gene bodies. At
the chromatin level, the number of gene promoters marked by H3K4me3 increases by 
more than one fifth; H3K27me3 undergoes dynamic genomic redistribution
characterized by loss at half of gene promoters and overall reduction of peak
size by almost half. This is paralleled by increased phosphorylation of EZH2 at
serine 21. Among genes with highly altered mRNA expression, 23.1% switch between 
H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 marks, and those point to the master EMT targets and
regulators CDH1, PDGFRa and ESRP1. Strikingly, Twist1 increases the number of
bivalent genes by more than two fold. Inhibition of the H3K27 methyltransferases 
EZH2 and EZH1, which form part of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2),
blocks EMT and stemness properties.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that the EMT program requires epigenetic
remodeling by the Polycomb and Trithorax complexes leading to increased cellular 
plasticity. This suggests that inhibiting epigenetic remodeling and thus decrease
plasticity will prevent EMT, and the associated breast cancer metastasis.

transcription factors such as AP2, Gbx2, Pax3 and Zic1. Among them, Pax3 and Zic1
are both necessary and sufficient to trigger a complete neural crest
developmental program. However, their gene targets in the neural crest regulatory
network remain unknown. Here, through a transcriptome analysis of frog
microdissected neural border, we identified an extended gene signature for the
premigratory neural crest, and we defined novel potential members of the
regulatory network. This signature includes 34 novel genes, as well as 44 known
genes expressed at the neural border. Using another microarray analysis which
combined Pax3 and Zic1 gain-of-function and protein translation blockade, we
uncovered 25 Pax3 and Zic1 direct targets within this signature. We demonstrated 
that the neural border specifiers Pax3 and Zic1 are direct upstream regulators of
neural crest specifiers Snail1/2, Foxd3, Twist1, and Tfap2b. In addition, they
may modulate the transcriptional output of multiple signaling pathways involved
in neural crest development (Wnt, Retinoic Acid) through the induction of key
pathway regulators (Axin2 and Cyp26c1). We also found that Pax3 could maintain
its own expression through a positive autoregulatory feedback loop. These
hierarchical inductions, feedback loops, and pathway modulations provide novel
tools to understand the neural crest induction network.

INTRODUCTION: Abnormal gene methylation has been observed in several cancers. A
prior study reported methylation of TWIST1 and NID2 as a quantitative biomarker
for urothelial carcinoma, but external validation has yet to be performed. We
sought to externally validate a urine-based methylation assay combining TWIST1
and NID2 and assess its clinical utility.
METHODS: A prospective trial was conducted comparing the methylation assay to
cystoscopy and biopsy in patients with hematuria or prior non-muscle invasive
bladder cancer. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive
values, and likelihood ratios of the methylation assay were calculated. Area
under the receiver operating characteristic curves for each gene and the combined
assay were computed. Bayesian analyses were performed to assess utility of the
assay for a variety of clinical scenarios.
RESULTS: Complete data were available for 111 patients. In validating the prior
assay definition in the current cohort, sensitivity and specificity were 79% and 
63%, respectively, and when optimized for the current cohort were 75% and 71%,
respectively. The area under the curve for the assay was 0.73 compared with
biopsy and 0.71 compared with cystoscopy.
CONCLUSIONS: We failed to replicate the excellent performance of the methylation 
assay in this external validation; however, this assay may have utility for
screening or surveillance for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.

RATIONALE: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a key role in the
development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer.
OBJECTIVES: There are five major EMT regulatory genes (Snai1, Slug, Zeb1, Zeb2,
and Twist1) involved in EMT. We hypothesized that germline variants in these
genes may influence the development of both diseases.
METHODS: Seven genetic variants were genotyped in two two-stage case-control
studies with 2,072 lung cancer cases and 2,077 control subjects, and 1,791
patients with COPD and 1,940 control subjects to show their associations with
development of both diseases.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: An exon variant c.353T>C(p.Val118Ala) of Snai1
harbored decreased risks of lung cancer (CT/CC vs. TT: odds ratio [OR], 0.76; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.90) and COPD (CC vs. CT vs. TT: OR, 0.75; 95%
CI, 0.63-0.89), and c.353T>C affected lung cancer risk indirectly through COPD
(COPD accounted for 6.78% of effect that the variant had on lung cancer).
Moreover, c.353T>C was correlated with lung cancer stages in smoking patients (P 
= 0.013), and those with the c.353C genotypes were less likely to have metastasis
at diagnosis than those with the c.353TT genotype (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41-0.88). 
The c.353C allele encoding p.118Ala attenuated Snai1's ability to up-regulate
mesenchymal biomarkers (i.e., fibronectin and vimentin) expression, and to
promote EMT-like changes, including morphologic changes, cell migration, and
invasion. However, these effects were not observed for the other variants.
CONCLUSIONS: The functional germline variant c.353T>C (p.Val118Ala) of Snai1
confers consistently decreased risks of lung cancer and COPD, and this variant
affects lung cancer risk through a mediation effect of COPD.

PURPOSE: The progression of prostate cancer to metastatic and
castration-resistant disease represents a critical step. We previously showed
that the transcription factor Twist1, which promotes epithelial-mesenchymal
transition, was involved in castration-resistant progression. Similarly, protein 
kinase C (PKC) has been implicated in both metastatic progression and castration 
resistance in prostate cancer.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of PKC/Twist1 
signaling in castration resistance, and to apply this information to the
development of a novel therapeutic concept using PKC inhibitor Ro31-8220 against 
prostate cancer using various prostate cancer cell lines.
RESULTS: Androgen deprivation and the next-generation antiandrogen enzalutamide
induced PKC activation and Twist1 expression, which were reversed by the PKC
inhibitor Ro31-8220. Ro31-8220 suppressed cell proliferation in
androgen-dependent prostate cancer LNCaP cells, which was augmented by its
combination with androgen deprivation or enzalutamide. The favorable anticancer
effects of the combination of Ro31-8220 and enzalutamide were also observed in
castration-resistant C4-2 and 22Rv1 cells. Furthermore, PKC phosphorylation was
elevated in castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant cells compared with
their parental cells, leading to persistent sensitivity to Ro-31-8220 in
castration- and enzalutamide-resistant cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings indicate that PKC/Twist1 signaling
contributes to castration resistance as well as enzalutamide resistance in
prostate cancer, and suggest that therapeutics targeting PKC/Twist1 signaling,
such as PKC inhibitors, represent a promising novel therapeutic strategy for
prostate cancer, especially castration-resistant prostate cancer, when combined
with enzalutamide.

    Breast Cancer Res. 2014;16(2):305.

ID genes are required for breast cancer colonization of the lungs, but the
mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Id1 expression induces a 
stem-like phenotype in breast cancer cells while retaining epithelial properties,
contrary to the notion that cancer stem-like properties are inextricably linked
to the mesenchymal state. During metastatic colonization, Id1 induces a
mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), specifically in cells whose
mesenchymal state is dependent on the Id1 target protein Twist1, but not at the
primary site, where this state is controlled by the zinc finger protein Snail1.
Knockdown of Id expression in metastasizing cells prevents MET and dramatically
reduces lung colonization. Furthermore, Id1 is induced by transforming growth
factor (TGF)-ß only in cells that have first undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT), demonstrating that EMT is a prerequisite for subsequent
Id1-induced MET during lung colonization. Collectively, these studies underscore 
the importance of Id-mediated phenotypic switching during distinct stages of
breast cancer metastasis.

Carbon nanotube-induced pulmonary granulomatous disease: Twist1 and alveolar
macrophage M1 activation.

Sarcoidosis, a chronic granulomatous disease of unknown cause, has been linked to
several environmental risk factors, among which are some that may favor carbon
nanotube formation. Using gene array data, we initially observed that
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from sarcoidosis patients displayed elevated
mRNA of the transcription factor, Twist1, among many M1-associated genes compared
to healthy controls. Based on this observation we hypothesized that Twist1 mRNA
and protein expression might become elevated in alveolar macrophages from animals
bearing granulomas induced by carbon nanotube instillation. To address this
hypothesis, wild-type and macrophage-specific peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor gamma (PPAR<U+03B3>) knock out mice were given oropharyngeal instillation of
multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). BAL cells obtained 60 days later exhibited
significantly elevated Twist1 mRNA expression in granuloma-bearing wild-type or
PPAR<U+03B3> knock out alveolar macrophages compared to sham controls. Overall, Twist1
expression levels in PPAR<U+03B3> knock out mice were higher than those of wild-type.
Concurrently, BAL cells obtained from sarcoidosis patients and healthy controls
validated gene array data: qPCR and protein analysis showed significantly
elevated Twist1 in sarcoidosis compared to healthy controls. In vitro studies of 
alveolar macrophages from healthy controls indicated that Twist1 was inducible by
classical (M1) macrophage activation stimuli (LPS, TNFa) but not by IL-4, an
inducer of alternative (M2) macrophage activation. Findings suggest that Twist1
represents a PPAR<U+03B3>-sensitive alveolar macrophage M1 biomarker which is induced by
inflammatory granulomatous disease in the MWCNT model and in human sarcoidosis.

Loss of E-cadherin activates EGFR-MEK/ERK signaling, which promotes invasion via 
the ZEB1/MMP2 axis in non-small cell lung cancer.

Loss of E-cadherin, a hallmark of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), can
significantly affect metastatic dissemination. However, the molecular mechanism
of EMT-associated metastatic dissemination by loss of E-cadherin still remains
unclear in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). In the present study, we show
that the knockdown of E-cadherin was sufficient to convert A549 NSCLC cells into 
mesenchymal type with the concurrent up-regulation of typical EMT inducers such
as ZEB1 and TWIST1. Interestingly, the EMT-induced cells by E-cadherin depletion 
facilitate invasion in a matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2)-dependent manner with 
aberrant activation of EGFR signaling. We demonstrated that the elevated
invasiveness was a result of the activated EGFR-MEK/ERK signaling, which in turn 
leads to ZEB1 dependent MMP2 induction. These results suggest that the
EGFR-MEK/ERK/ZEB1/MMP2 axis is responsible for promoted invasion in EMT-induced
NSCLCs. Consistently, ERK activation and loss of E-cadherin were both observed in
the disseminating cancer cells at the invasive tumor fronts in NSCLS cancer
tissues. Thereby, these data suggest that the EGFR-MEK/ERK signaling would be a
promising molecular target to control aberrant MMP2 expression and consequent
invasion in the EMT-induced NSCSLs.

A survey of zeb1, twist and claudin 1 and 4 expression during placental
development and disease.

We investigated zeb1, twist and claudins 1 and 4 in normal and diseased placental
tissues. Eighty cases of placental tissues from all three trimesters and from
different diseases were studied immunohistochemically to determine the expression
of zeb1, twist and claudins 1 and 4. Zeb1 was more strongly expressed in
endothelial and mesenchymal cells of the villous structures during the last two
trimesters, suggesting that it plays a role in the development of placental blood
vessels. In contrast, twist was more strongly expressed in the trophoblastic
cells during these trimesters. The endothelial and stromal expression of zeb1 and
the epithelial expression of twist were disturbed in those placentas with
chromosomal aberrations. Claudin 4 was strongly expressed in trophoblastic cells 
during all trimesters. Its expression was especially strong in molar disease,
suggesting that it could participate in trophoblastic aggregation and disturbed
attachment of trophoblastic cells in the expanded villi. Claudin 4 expression was
also increased in the placentas of diabetic mothers and in toxaemia. Claudin 1
did not show any specific disease associations. The study implicates that twist
and zeb1 are involved in placental maturation, whereas claudin 4 appears to be
connected with placental diseases such as diabetes, toxaemia or molar disease.

BACKGROUND: Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) have an important role in metastatic 
processes, but details of their basic characteristics remain elusive. We
hypothesised that CD44-expressing CTCs show a mesenchymal phenotype and high
potential for survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS: Circulating CD44(+)CD90(+) cells, previously shown to be
tumour-initiating cells, were sorted from human blood and their genetic
characteristics were compared with those of tumour cells from primary tissues.
The mechanism underlying the high survival potential of CD44-expressing cells in 
the circulatory system was investigated in vitro.
RESULTS: CD44(+)CD90(+) cells in the blood acquired epithelial-mesenchymal
transition, and CD44 expression remarkably increased from the tissue to the
blood. In Li7 and HLE cells, the CD44(high) population showed higher anoikis
resistance and sphere-forming ability than did the CD44(low) population. This
difference was found to be attributed to the upregulation of Twist1 and Akt
signal in the CD44(high) population. Twist1 knockdown showed remarkable reduction
in anoikis resistance, sphere formation, and Akt signal in HLE cells. In
addition, mesenchymal markers and CD44s expression were downregulated in the
Twist1 knockdown.
CONCLUSIONS: CD44s symbolises the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype
regulating anchorage-independent capacity. CD44s-expressing tumour cells in
peripheral blood are clinically important therapeutic targets in HCC.

SALL4, a zinc-finger transcriptional factor for embryonic stem cell self-renewal 
and pluripotency, has been suggested to be involved in tumorigenesis. The role of
SALL4 in human gastric cancer, however, remains largely unknown. In this study,
we demonstrated that SALL4 was aberrantly expressed at both mRNA and protein
levels in human gastric cancer tissues, and SALL4 level was highly correlated
with lymph node metastasis. Enforced expression of SALL4 enhanced the
proliferation and migration of human gastric cancer cells, whereas knockdown of
SALL4 by siRNA led to the opposite effects. In addition, SALL4 overexpression
promoted the growth and metastasis of gastric xenograft tumor in vivo. SALL4
overexpression induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in gastric cancer 
cells, with increased expression of Twist1, N-cadherin and decreased expression
of E-cadherin. Moreover, SALL4 promoted the acquirement of stemness in gastric
cancer cells through the induction of Bmi-1 and Lin28B. Taken together, our
findings indicate that SALL4 has oncogenic roles in gastric cancer through the
modulation of EMT and cell stemness, suggesting SALL4 as a novel target for human
gastric cancer diagnosis and therapy.

Tumor necrosis factor a induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition and promotes
metastasis via NF-<U+03BA>B signaling pathway-mediated TWIST expression in
hypopharyngeal cancer.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important mechanism in cancer
metastasis. Tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) can induce cancer invasion and
metastasis associated with EMT. However, the underlying mechanisms are not
entirely clear. Therefore, we investigated whether TNFa has an effect on EMT and 
invasion and metastasis in human hypopharyngeal cancer FaDu cells, and further
explored the potential mechanisms. In the present study, we demonstrated that
TNFa induced EMT in FaDu cells and promoted FaDu cell migration and invasion.
TNFa-induced EMT was characterized by a change from well organized cell-cell
adhesion and cell polarity to loss of cell-cell contacts, cell scattering and
increased expression of vimentin and N-cadherin accompanied by a decrease in
E-cadherin. Furthermore, we found that p65 translocated to the nucleus after TNFa
stimulation and increased the nuclear expression of TWIST. We demonstrated that
TNFa treatment also increased the expression of TWIST by activating the NF-<U+03BA>B
signaling pathway. While p65 was inhibited by siRNA-65 or BAY11-7082 (inhibitor
of NF-<U+03BA>B), TWIST expression was also decreased. Therefore, we conclude that TNFa 
induces EMT and promotes metastasis via NF-<U+03BA>B signaling pathway-mediated TWIST
expression in hypopharyngeal cancer.

Krüppel-like factor 17 (KLF17), a member of the KLF transcription factor family, 
has been shown to inhibit the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor
growth. However, the expression, the cellular function and the mechanism of KLF17
in endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC; a dominant type of endometrial cancer)
remain elusive. Here, we report that among the KLF family members, KLF17 was
consistently upregulated in EEC cell lines compared with immortalized endometrial
epithelial cells. Overexpression of KLF17 in EEC cell lines induced EMT and
promoted cell invasion and drug resistance, resulting in increased expression of 
TWIST1. In contrast, KLF17 suppression reversed EMT, diminished cell invasion,
restored drug sensitivity and suppressed TWIST1 expression. Luciferase assays,
site-directed mutagenesis and transcription factor DNA-binding analysis
demonstrated that KLF17 transactivates TWIST1 expression by directly binding to
the TWIST1 promoter. Knockdown of TWIST1 prevented KLF17-induced EMT. Consistent 
with these results, both KLF17 and TWIST1 levels were found to be elevated in
EECs compared with normal tissues. KLF17 expression positively correlated with
tumor grade but inversely correlated with estrogen and progesterone receptor
expression. Thus, KLF17 may have an oncogenic role during EEC progression via
initiating EMT through the regulation of TWIST1.

Breast cancers can metastasize via hematogenous and lymphatic routes, however in 
some patients only one type of metastases are detected, suggesting a certain
proclivity in metastatic patterns. Since epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 
plays an important role in cancer dissemination it would be worthwhile to find if
a specific profile of EMT gene expression exists that is related to either
lymphatic or hematogenous dissemination. Our study aimed at evaluating gene
expression profile of EMT-related markers in primary tumors (PT) and correlated
them with the pattern of metastatic spread. From 99 early breast cancer patients 
peripheral blood samples (N = 99), matched PT (N = 47) and lymph node metastases 
(LNM; N = 22) were collected. Expression of TWIST1, SNAI1, SNAI2 and VIM was
analyzed in those samples. Additionally expression of CK19, MGB1 and HER2 was
measured in CTCs-enriched blood fractions (CTCs-EBF). Results were correlated
with each other and with clinico-pathological data of the patients. Results show 
that the mesenchymal phenotype of CTCs-EBF correlated with poor
clinico-pathological characteristics of the patients. Additionally, PT shared
more similarities with LNM than with CTCs-EBF. Nevertheless, LNM showed increased
expression of EMT-related markers than PT; and EMT itself in PT did not seem to
be necessary for lymphatic dissemination.

Twist1 promotes gastric cancer cell proliferation through up-regulation of FoxM1.

Qian J(1), Luo Y, Gu X, Zhan W, Wang X.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medical Oncology, Changzheng Hospital, Shanghai, China.

Twist-related protein 1 (Twist1), also known as class A basic helix-loop-helix
protein 38 (bHLHa38), has been implicated in cell lineage determination and
differentiation. Previous studies demonstrate that Twist1 expression is
up-regulated in gastric cancer with poor clinical outcomes. Besides, Twist1 is
suggested to be involved in progression of human gastric cancer. However, its
biological functions remain largely unexplored. In the present study, we show
that Twist 1 overexpression leads to a significant up-regulation of FoxM1, which 
plays a key role in cell cycle progression in gastric cancer cells. In contrast, 
knockdown of Twist 1 reduces FoxM1 expression, suggesting that FoxM1 might be a
direct transcriptional target of Twist 1. At the molecular level, we further
reveal that Twist 1 could bind to the promoter region of FoxM1, and subsequently 
recruit p300 to induce FoxM1 mRNA transcription. Therefore, our results uncover a
previous unknown Twist 1/FoxM1 regulatory pathway, which may help to understand

Some higher vertebrates can display unique muscle regenerative abilities through 
dedifferentiation. Research evidence suggests that induced dedifferentiation can 
be achieved in mammalian cells. TWIST is a bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix)
transcription factor that is expressed during embryonic development and plays
critical roles in diverse developmental systems including myogenesis. Several
experiments demonstrated its role in inhibition of muscle cell differentiation.
We have previously shown that overexpression of TWIST can reverse muscle cell
differentiation in the presence of growth factors. Here we show that TWIST
reverses muscle cell differentiation through binding and down-regulation of
myogenin. Moreover, it can reverse cellular morphology in the absence of growth
factors.

PURPOSE: Our publications demonstrate that physiological concentrations of
oestrogen (E2) induce endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress which finally
result in apoptosis in E2-deprived breast cancer cells, MCF-7:5C. c-Src is
involved in the process of E2-induced stress. To mimic the clinical
administration of c-Src inhibitors, we treated cells with either E2, a c-Src
inhibitor PP2, or the combination for 8 weeks to further explore the apoptotic
potential of the c-Src inhibitor and E2 on MCF-7:5C cells.
METHODS: Protein levels of receptors and signalling pathways were examined by
immunoblotting. Expression of mRNA was detected through real-time polymerase
chain reaction (PCR). Cell cycles were analysed by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Long-term treatment with PP2 alone or E2 alone decreased cell growth. In
contrast, a combination of PP2 and E2 blocked apoptosis and the resulting cell
line (MCF-7:PF) was unique, as they grew vigorously in culture with physiological
levels of E2, which could be blocked by the pure antioestrogen ICI182,780. One
major change was that PP2 collaborated with E2 to increase the level of
insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor beta (IGF-1Rß). Blockade of IGF-1Rß
completely abolished E2-stimulated growth in MCF-7:PF cells. Furthermore,
combination treatment up-regulated transcription factors, Twist1 and Snail, and
repressed E-cadherin expression which made MCF-7:PF cells display a
characteristic phenotype of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
CONCLUSIONS: These data illustrate the role of the c-Src inhibitor to block
E2-induced apoptosis and enhance E2-stimulated growth. Caution must be exercised 
when considering c-Src inhibitors in clinical trials following the development of
acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors, especially in the presence of the
patient's own oestrogen.

OBJECTIVE: Twist, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, plays a key role
in the metastatic progression of human cancer. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9
is an endopeptidase that digests basement membrane type IV collagen, therefore
being possibly related to tumor progression. It has been reported that Twist and 
matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) are expressed in gastric cancers. However, the
exact roles of Twist and MMP-9 in tumor metastasis and prognosis remain unclear. 
The aim of this study was to casts light on this question.
METHODS: Twist and MMP-9 expression in tissue sections of 37 gastric carcinomas
was evaluated with immunohistochemistry. The staining results were compared with 
clinicopathologic features and to patients'outcome.
RESULTS: Twist positive expression was significantly increased in gastric cancer 
cases with lymph node metastasis (P=0.023). But no correlations were found
between MMP-9 overexpression and clinicopathologic features, such as recurrence, 
TNM stage, and lymph node metastasis. Overall survival (OS) was significantly
correlated with recurrence, serosa invasion, TNM stages, distant metastasis, and 
MMP-9 (P=0.027, 0.021, 0.000, 0.024 and 0.036, respectively). Disease-free
survival (DFS) was prominently related to recurrence location, serosa invasion
and TNM stages (P=0.000, 0.038 and 0.003, respectively). In the Cox regression
multivariate analysis, TNM stage, distant metastasis and MMP-9 were significantly
associated with prognosis of gastric cancer (P=0.002, 0.019, and 0.032,
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed Twist positive expression to be significantly
correlated with lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer. MMP-9 overexpression is 
associated with OS, suggesting that MMP-9 is a prognostic indicator for survival 
in patients with gastric cancer.

BACKGROUND: Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis has found application in a limited
number of genetic diseases due to the difficulty in detecting a few copies of
fetal mutated sequences in the presence of a large excess of wild-type maternal
alleles, even in the case of single-base mutations.
METHODS: We developed conditions for the enrichment of fetal mutated alleles in
maternal plasma based on CO-amplification at lower denaturation temperature-PCR
(COLD-PCR). In particular, we applied a full COLD-PCR protocol to the
identification of a p.A87_G92del mutation in the TWIST1 gene causing
craniosynostosis in a couple at risk for the disease.
RESULTS: The use of the COLD-PCR protocol coupled with direct sequencing enabled 
correct identification of the fetal paternally inherited mutated allele, in
accordance with the result obtained on DNA extracted from chorionic villi.
CONCLUSIONS: COLD-PCR proved to be a simple and powerful tool for the
identification of minority mutated alleles even in the case of a moderately large
deletion (18 bp) and confirmed to be very suitable for non-invasive prenatal
diagnosis of a variety of genetic diseases.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is presently recognized as an
important event and the initiating stage for tumor invasion and metastasis.
Several EMT inducers have been identified, among which the big family of
helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factors are rising as a novel and promising 
family of proteins in EMT mediation, such as Twist1, Twist2, E47, and HIFs, etc. 
Due to the variety and complexities of HLH members, the pathways and mechanisms
they employ to promote EMT are also complex and characteristic. In this review,
we will discuss the roles of various HLH proteins in the regulation and
sustenance of the EMT and multiple cellular mechanisms, attempting to provide a
novel and broadened view towards the link between HLH proteins and EMT.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the leading causes of
cancer deaths worldwide. In recent studies, a crucial link has been discovered
between the acquisition of metastatic traits and tumour-initiating abilities in
cancer cells during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Herein, we
demonstrated that the ectopic expression of TWIST1, the EMT regulator, in HNSCC
FaDu cells triggered EMT and resulted in the acquisition of a mesenchymal
phenotype. Moreover, FaDu-pFLAG-TWIST1 cancer cell populations that were induced 
to EMT displayed an increased proportion of cells with the CD44 marker, which is 
associated with tumour initiation. Interestingly, we found that emodin treatment 
reduced the tumour-initiating abilities and inhibited cell migration and invasion
in FaDu-pFLAG-TWIST1 cells. Emodin directly inhibited TWIST1 expression,
upregulated E-cadherin mRNA and protein expression, and downregulated vimentin
mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, we found that emodin inhibited TWIST1
binding to the E-cadherin promoter and repressed E-cadherin transcription
activity. We also found that emodin inhibited TWIST1-induced EMT by inhibiting
the ß-catenin and Akt pathways. More interestingly, emodin significantly
inhibited TWIST1-induced invasion in vivo. Therefore, emodin might be applicable 
to anticancer therapy and could be a potential new therapeutic drug for HNSCC.

BACKGROUND: Locoregional recurrence and distant metastases are ominous events in 
patients with advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The objective of this
study was to identify functional biomarkers that are predictive of OSCC
progression to metastasis.
METHODS: The expression profile of a network of epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) genes was investigated in a large cohort of patients with progressive OSCC 
using a complimentary DNA microarray platform coupled to quantitative reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analyses.
Therapeutic potential was investigated in vitro and in vivo using an orthotopic
mouse model of metastatic OSCC growing in the tongue microenvironment.
RESULTS: Among deregulated EMT genes, the Twist-related protein 1 (TWIST1)
transcription factor and several of its regulated genes were significantly
overexpressed across advanced stages of OSCC. This result was corroborated by the
clinical observation that Twist1 up-regulation predicted the occurrence of lymph 
node and lung metastases as well as poor patient survival. In support of Twist1
as a driver of OSCC progression, the up-regulation of Twist1 was observed in
cells isolated from patients with metastatic OSCC. The inhibition of Twist1 in
these metastatic cells induced a potent inhibition of cell invasiveness in vitro 
as well as progression in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: The current results provide evidence for the prognostic value and
therapeutic potential of a network of Twist genes in patients with advanced OSCC.

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tumor cells is deemed to be
closely associated with tumor metastasis. CXCR4 has been proved to play an
important role in the process of tumor metastasis. This study illustrates the
function and expression of CXCR4 silencing and the EMT related genes in the human
glioma cell line U87. The results showed that CXCR4 silencing could inhibit the
cell invasive and adhesion potentials, expression of N-cadherin, vimentin,
ß-catenin, TGF-ß1, p-Smad2, and p-Akt, and the activity of transcription factors 
NF-<U+03BA>B, AP-1, Snail, and twist. Meanwhile, CXCR4 silencing could also up-regulate 
the expression of E-cadherin, indicating that silencing of CXCR4 expression can
inhibit the expression of EMT related genes in U87 cells. The study would provide
a potential theoretical basis for the further exploration of the role of CXCR4 in
human glioma.

Maxillofacial Surgery, Guanghua School and Research Institute of Stomatology, Sun
Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510055, PR China.

Although many researches have been undertaken to disclose the mechanisms of
chemoresistance, the mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study is to
elucidate the role of miR-181a-Twist1 pathway in the chemoresistance of tongue
squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC). We found that cisplatin-induced chemoresistance
in TSCC cell lines underwent EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) and was
accompanied by enhancing metastatic potential (migration and invasion in vitro), 
miR-181a downregulation and Twist1 upregulation. Functional analyses indicated
that miR-181a reversed chemoresistance, inhibited EMT and metastatic potential in
TSCC cells. Twist1 was confirmed as a direct miR-181a target gene by luciferase
reporter gene assays. Twist1 knockdown by siRNA led to a reversal of the
chemoresistance, inhibited EMT and metastatic potential in TSCC cells. Our study 
demonstrates that miR-181a-Twist1 pathway may play an important role in the
development of cisplatin-chemoresistance, with EMT and an increase the metastatic
potential of TSCC cells.

Inhibition of ZNF746 suppresses invasion and epithelial to mesenchymal transition
in H460 non-small cell lung cancer cells.

Although ZNF746, also known as Parkin-interacting substrate (PARIS), has been
reported to suppress peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <U+03B3> coactivator-1a 
(PGC-1a) and its target gene NRF-1 leading to the neurodegeneration in
Parkinson's disease, its function in tumorigenesis has yet to be investigated.
Thus, in the present study, the role of ZNF746 in the invasion and epithelial to 
mesenchymal transition (EMT) in H460 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells was
investigated. Invasion assay showed that inhibition of ZNF746 using siRNA
transfection inhibited the invasion of H460 NSCLC cells using Boyden chamber.
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed that the silencing of ZNF746 attenuated
the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)1, MMP2 and MMP9, but not MMP7,
in H460 NSCLC cells. Immunoblotting assay revealed that the expression of
E-cadherin and ß-catenin of epithelial phenotype was upregulated, while Slug was 
downregulated in ZNF746 siRNA-transfected H460 NSCLC cells. Accordingly, the mRNA
expression of E-cadherin was upregulated while vimentin or Slug, Twist, ZEB as
EMT key transcriptional factors were suppressed in ZNF746 siRNA-transfected H460 
NSCLC cells. Also, mRNA expression of transcriptional marker Nanog and
Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4), known to enhance malignancy and
metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma, was suppressed in ZNF746 siRNA-transfected
H460 NSCLC cells. Notably, the endogenous expression of ZNF746 was induced in
parallel with Twist at the protein level during hypoxia. Overall, our findings
suggest that inhibition of ZNF746 suppresses the invasion and EMT molecules in
H460 NSCLC cells and ZNF746 may be an important target molecule in lung
tumorigenesis.

Craniosynostosis is one of the most common craniofacial disorders encountered in 
clinical genetics practice, with an overall incidence of 1 in 2,500. Between 30% 
and 70% of syndromic craniosynostoses are caused by mutations in hotspots in the 
fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes or in the TWIST1 gene with the
difference in detection rates likely to be related to different study populations
within craniofacial centers. Here we present results from molecular testing of an
Australia and New Zealand cohort of 630 individuals with a diagnosis of
craniosynostosis. Data were obtained by Sanger sequencing of FGFR1, FGFR2, and
FGFR3 hotspot exons and the TWIST1 gene, as well as copy number detection of
TWIST1. Of the 630 probands, there were 231 who had one of 80 distinct mutations 
(36%). Among the 80 mutations, 17 novel sequence variants were detected in three 
of the four genes screened. In addition to the proband cohort there were 96
individuals who underwent predictive or prenatal testing as part of family
studies. Dysmorphic features consistent with the known FGFR1-3/TWIST1-associated 
syndromes were predictive for mutation detection. We also show a statistically
significant association between splice site mutations in FGFR2 and a clinical
diagnosis of Pfeiffer syndrome, more severe clinical phenotypes associated with
FGFR2 exon 10 versus exon 8 mutations, and more frequent surgical procedures in
the presence of a pathogenic mutation. Targeting gene hot spot areas for mutation
analysis is a useful strategy to maximize the success of molecular diagnosis for 
individuals with craniosynostosis.

MART-10, a less calcemic vitamin D analog, is more potent than
1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in inhibiting the metastatic potential of MCF-7 breast 
cancer cells in vitro.

With the recent advance in breast cancer therapy, the survival rate of breast
cancer patients has improved greatly. In spite of the progress, 25-50% of breast 
cancer patients eventually will develop metastasis. Due to limited early
detection methods, metastasis is usually diagnosed at the late stages beyond
recovery likely due to resistance to currently available breast cancer therapies.
Thus, a new strategy to prevent cancer cell growth and repress tumor metastasis
is desirable. The active form of vitamin D3, 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
[1a,25(OH)2D3], has anti-invasion and anti-migration properties in pre-clinical
studies, yet its clinical application has been hampered by its hypercalcemic side
effect. Previously, we have demonstrated that a new class of less-calcemic
vitamin D analog, 19-nor-2a-(3-hydroxypropyl)-1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
(MART-10), is 1000-fold more active than 1a,25(OH)2D3 in suppressing MCF-7 cells 
growth through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. In the current study,
we show for the first time that MART-10 is more active than 1a,25(OH)2D3 in
preventing MCF-7 cell invasion and migration likely mediated through the
upregulation of E-cadherin, and the downregulation of Snail, Slug, and Twist, the
transcription factors implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as
well as MMP-13. Based on the current in vitro and the highly anti-tumor
characteristics of MART-10 in a pancreatic xenograft model, MART-10 is deemed as 
a promising candidate for breast cancer treatment. Further in vivo animal study
comparing MART-10 with 1a,25(OH)2D3 and other potent and less calcemic analogs of
vitamin D is warranted.

Although it is becoming clear that certain miRNAs fulfil a fundamental role in
the regulation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a comprehensive
study of the miRNAs associated with this process has yet to be performed. Here,
we profiled the signature of miRNA expression in an in vitro model of EMT,
ectopically expressing in MDCK cells one of seven EMT transcription factors
(SNAI1, SNAI2, ZEB1, ZEB2, TWIST1, TWIST2 or E47) or the EMT inducer LOXL2. In
this way, we identified a core subset of deregulated miRNAs that were further
validated in vivo, studying endometrial carcinosarcoma (ECS), a tumour entity
that represents an extreme example of phenotypic plasticity. Moreover, epigenetic
silencing through DNA methylation of miRNA genes of the miR-200 family and
miR-205 that are down-regulated during EMT was evident in both the in vitro (MDCK
transfectants) and in vivo (ECS) models of EMT. The strong correlation between
expression and DNA methylation suggests a major role for this epigenetic mark in 
the regulation of the miR-141-200c locus.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of death of both men and women across the world.
Overexpression and activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor-1
(EGFR1) are frequently observed and associated with poor prognosis. To inhibit
the function of EGFR1, multiple antibodies and small-molecule tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKI) that target EGFR1 have been developed. Even though some patients
respond to these TKI, subsequent studies reveal that this is not the case for all
nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. In this study, we determine whether
activation and expression levels of EGFR1, ERK, AKT, STAT3, and TWIST1 are
dependent on the activating mutations of EGFR1. Protein lysates and DNA have been
isolated from tumor and corresponding normal tissues of 16 NSCLC patients.
Genomic-DNA is used to sequence the exons 18, 19, and 21 of EGFR1, and exon 2 of 
k-RAS. Protein lysates were used to determine the expression or phosphorylation
levels of EGFR, STAT3, ERK, AKT, and TWIST1. Our results revealed that 16 tumor
samples of NSCLC patients showed no mutation in any of the indicated exons of
EGFR1 and k-RAS albeit significant levels of activation or expression of the
above-mentined oncogenes. In NSCLC patients, the tumor micro-environment can be
as important as the activating mutations of EGFR1. TK therapy may also be
considered for patients who show high levels of activation of EGFR1 even in the
absence of activating mutations.

The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transient (EMT) is associated with tumor
metastasis. Twist is one of the key transcription factors for EMT and relates to 
tumor cell migration. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently emerged as
important regulatory molecules involved in a broad range of biological processes 
and complicated diseases. However, it is unknown whether a signal network and
lncRNAs are involved in Twist-induced EMT program. Taking MCF10A/Twist as a
model, more than 99 lncRNAs and 3164 genes are regulated in the Twist-induced EMT
process using lncRNA-array and cDNA micro-array. We establish a downstream signal
network associated with EMT induced by Twist using bioinformatic analysis (Gene
Ontology, pathway analysis) and experimental data. A set of multiple canonical
signal pathways (such as WNT, MAPK, JAK/STAT, TGF-ß, mTOR, Hedgehog and P53
signaling pathways) and several lncRNAs [such as lncRNA (chr6, 26124411-26139312,
+), lncRNA (chr1, 41944445-41949874, -), lncRNA (chr17, 44833874-44834830, +)]
are altered in MCF10A/Twist cells. More interestingly, lncRNA (chr17,
44833874-44834830, +), lncRNA (chr17, 21142183-21156578, -), lncRNA (chr6,
26124411-26139312, +) and lncRNA (chr19, 438420-2083745, -) may be involved in
regulation or activation of WNT signaling pathway in the Twist-induced EMT
process. These findings first determine that Twist contributes to invasion and
metastasis by inducing wide-ranging transcriptional and functional changes of
lncRNAs and signal pathways in our study.

traits during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is an important mechanism in
cancer metastasis. Although transcription factors including SNAIL, SLUG, and
TWIST1 regulate the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, other unknown
transcription factors could also be involved. Identification of the full
complement of transcription factors is essential for a more complete
understanding of gene regulation in this process. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) technologies have been used to detect
genome-wide binding of transcription factors; here, we developed a systematic
approach to integrate existing ChIP-Seq and transcriptome data. We scanned
multiple transcription factors to investigate their functional impact on the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in the human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell
line.
RESULTS: Among the transcription factors tested, impact scores identified the
forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) as the most significant transcription factor in
the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. FOXA1 physically associates with the
promoters of its predicted target genes. Several critical
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition effectors involved in cellular adhesion and 
cellular communication were identified in the regulatory network of FOXA1,
including FOXA2, FGA, FGB, FGG, and FGL1. The implication of FOXA1 in the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via its regulatory network indicates that
FOXA1 may play an important role in the initiation of lung cancer metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified FOXA1 as a potentially important transcription factor 
and negative regulator in the initial stages of lung cancer metastasis. FOXA1 may
modulate the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via its transcriptional
regulatory network. Further, this study demonstrates how ChIP-Seq and expression 
data could be integrated to delineate the impact of transcription factors on a
specific biological process.

BACKGROUND: Gankyrin has shown to be overexpressed in human liver cancers and
plays a complex role in hepatocarcinogenesis. Panobinostat (LBH589), a new
hydroxamic acid-derived histone deacetylase inhibitor has shown promising
anticancer effects recently. Here, we investigated the potential of LBH589 as a
form of treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS: Gankyrin plasmid was transfected into HCC cells, and the cells were
selected for more than 4 weeks by incubation with G418 for overexpression clones.
The therapeutic effects of LBH589 were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Cell
proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, invasive potential, and
epithelial-mesenchy-mal transition (EMT) were examined.
RESULTS: LBH589 significantly inhibited HCC growth and metastasis in vitro and in
vivo. Western blotting analysis indicated that LBH589 could decrease the
expression of gankyrin and subsequently reduced serine-phosphorylated Akt and
tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 expression although the total Akt and STAT3 were
unaffected. LBH589 inhibited metastasis in vitro via down-regulation of
N-cadherin, vimentin, TWIST1, VEGF and up-regulation of E-cadherin. LBH589 also
induced apoptosis and G1 phase arrest in HCC cell lines. Ectopic expression of
gankyrin attenuated the effects of LBH589, which indicates that gankyrin might
play an important role in LBH589 mediated anticancer effects. Lastly, in vivo
study indicated that LBH589 inhibited tumor growth and metastasis, without
discernable adverse effects comparing to control group, with abrogating
gankyrin/STAT3/Akt pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that LBH589 could inhibit HCC growth and
metastasis through down-regulating gankyrin/STAT3/Akt pathway. LBH589 may present
itself as a novel therapeutic strategy for HCC.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) form a family of enzymes, which have fundamental
roles in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression and contribute to the
growth, differentiation, and apoptosis of cancer cells. In this study, we firstly
investigated the biological function of HDAC5 in osteosarcoma cells. We found
that mRNA and protein levels of HDAC5 were upregulated in osteosarcoma tissues
and cell lines. Furthermore, overexpression of HDAC5 could promote cell
proliferation in osteosarcoma cell lines. In contrast, HDAC5 knockdown using
small interfering RNA inhibited cell proliferation. At the molecular level, we
demonstrated that HDAC5 promoted mRNA expression of twist 1, which has been
reported as an oncogene. Together, these results highlighted for the first time
an unrecognized link between HDAC5 and osteosarcoma progression and demonstrated 
that its specific inhibition might contribute to the treatment of tumorigenesis.

TWIST1.

Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among females, with tumor
metastasis being primarily responsible for breast cancer-associated mortality.
Current literatures have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are implicated in tumor
metastasis. In this study, we found that the expression of miR-720 was
significantly downregulated in primary breast cancer, with greater downregulation
in metastatic tumors. Statistical analysis of 105 cases of primary human breast
cancer demonstrated that decreased expression of miR-720 was correlated with
lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, reexpression of miR-720 in breast cancer
cells remarkably inhibited cell invasiveness and migration both in vitro and in
vivo. Mechanistically, downregulation of TWIST1, a promoter of metastasis that
was identified as a direct functional target of miR-720, was attributed to the
inhibition of metastasis. Consistent with the reduced TWIST1 levels in breast
cancer, reexpression of miR-720 upregulated epithelial markers (E-cadherin and
ß-catenin) and downregulated mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, fibronectin,
vimentin and matrix metalloproteinase-2). Expression of miR-720 was inversely
associated with TWIST1 in human breast cancer tissues. Knockdown of TWIST1
expression by small interfering RNA exhibited similar effects to reintroduction
of miR-720, whereas overexpression of TWIST1 (without the 3'-untranslated region)
abrogated miR-720-mediated metastasis inhibition. Collectively, our data indicate
that miR-720 is frequently decreased in breast cancer and manifests
antimetastatic activity by downregulating TWIST1, presenting a novel mechanism of
miRNA-mediated regulation of tumor metastasis.

Aberrant expression of embryonic epithelial-mesenchymal transition-inducing
transcription factors (EMT-TFs) in epithelial cells triggers EMT, neoplastic
transformation, stemness, and metastatic dissemination. We found that regulation 
and functions of EMT-TFs are different in malignant melanoma. SNAIL2 and ZEB2
transcription factors are expressed in normal melanocytes and behave as
tumor-suppressor proteins by activating an MITF-dependent melanocyte
differentiation program. In response to NRAS/BRAF activation, EMT-TF network
undergoes a profound reorganization in favor of TWIST1 and ZEB1. This reversible 
switch cooperates with BRAF in promoting dedifferentiation and neoplastic
transformation of melanocytes. We detected EMT-TF reprogramming in late-stage
melanoma in association with enhanced phospho-ERK levels. This switch results in 
E-cadherin loss, enhanced invasion, and constitutes an independent factor of poor
prognosis in melanoma patients.

Melanoma patients frequently have elevated serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), 
which is correlated with a poor prognosis. IL-6 activates STAT3 phosphorylation, 
inducing the transcription of genes that regulate tumor cell proliferation and
antiapoptosis. In addition, recent evidence suggests that IL-6 induces the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and enhances the invasiveness of tumor cells
of epithelial origin. However, it is unknown whether IL-6 affects mesenchymal
tumor cells. In this study, we examined the effects of IL-6 on melanoma cells and
found that IL-6 can enhance their metastatic potential by regulating the
expression of Twist and N-cadherin. First, we confirmed that human melanoma
tissues express IL-6 (especially at the lesion site), the IL-6 receptor,
N-cadherin, and nuclear Twist. Next, we found that IL-6 induces STAT3
phosphorylation in WM-266-4 human melanoma cells, resulting in transient
upregulation of Twist, which is a key regulator of metastasis. Importantly, the
expression of N-cadherin, a protein downstream of Twist, was also increased on
the cell surface after treatment with IL-6. These cells showed enhanced
invasiveness, assessed using an invasion assay, and formed more metastatic
nodules in the lungs of NOD-SCID mice after an intravenous injection.
Importantly, melanoma cells with knocked-down N-cadherin formed less lung nodules
compared with control in the NOD-SCID mouse model. Our data suggest that
increased serum IL-6 in cancer patients could increase the invasiveness of
melanoma cells and accelerate metastasis. Blocking IL-6 in the melanoma
microenvironment may therefore inhibit disease progression.

Synovial sarcoma is an aggressive mesenchymal tumor with dual differentiation;
epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation. However, the molecular mechanisms
behind tumorigenesis and dual differentiation have remained elusive. In this
study, we investigated whether Twist1 is an essential transcription factor for
maintaining tumor-initiating cell properties in synovial sarcoma. First, we
identified that Twist1 is overexpressed in most cases of synovial sarcoma (SS)
samples as well as in two synovial sarcoma cell lines (HSSYII, SW982).
Additionally, Twist1 depletion led to down-regulation of mesenchymal markers and 
up-regulation of epithelial markers in SS cell lines. The migratory and invasive 
abilities of SS cell lines were also significantly reduced following the loss of 
Twist1. These results indicate that Twist1 plays an essential role in the
maintenance of mesenchymal character in SS. Furthermore, knock-down of Twist1
induced G1 cycle arrest and apoptosis as well as remarkable reduction in the
sphere-forming cell subpopulation and side population cells. Moreover, Twist1
knock-down profoundly inhibited the growth of synovial sarcoma xenograft in nude 
mice compared to controls indicating that Twist1 is essential for tumor
initiating cell properties. To explore transcriptional regulation by Twist1 at
the genomic level, Chromatin immunoprecipiation-solexa whole genome sequencing
(ChIP-SEQ) and cDNA microarray analysis were performed. Mesenchymal
differentiation/proliferation and PDGF related genes were found to be affected by
Twist1. Finally, depletion of SS18-SSX fusion oncoprotein by RNA inference
induced down-regulation of Twist1, implying that Twist1 is regulated by SS18-SSX.
Hence, our results suggest that Twist1 is an essential transcription factor for
the maintenance of mesenchymal characters and tumor initiating properties of
synovial sarcoma.

Distinctive genotypic and phenotypic features of ovarian cancer via
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) have been correlated with drug resistance
and disease recurrence. We investigated whether therapeutic reversal of EMT could
re-sensitize ovarian cancer cells (OCCs) to existing chemotherapy. We report that
epimorphin, a morphogenic protein, has pivotal control over mesenchymal versus
epithelial cell lineage decision of the putative OCCs. Exposure to epimorphin
induced morphological changes reminiscent of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition
(MET), but in a dose dependent manner, i.e., at 10 µg/mL of epimorphin cells
obtain a more mesenchymal-like morphology while at 20 µg/mL of epimorphin cells
display an epithelial morphology. The latter changes were accompanied by
suppression of mesenchymal markers, such as vimentin (~8-fold<U+2193>, p<0.02), Twist1
(~7-fold<U+2193>, p<0.03), dystroglycan (~4-fold<U+2193>, p<0.01) and palladin (~3-fold<U+2193>,
p<0.01). Conversely, significant elevations of KLF4 (~28-fold<U+2191>, p<0.002),
ß-catenin (~6-fold<U+2191>, p<0.004), EpCAM (~6-fold<U+2191>, p<0.0002) and occludin
(~15-fold<U+2191>, p<0.004) mRNAs as part of the commitment to the epithelial cell
lineage were detected in response to 20 µg/mL of exogenous epimorphin. Changes in
occludin mRNA levels were accompanied by a parallel, albeit weaker expression at 
the protein level (~5-fold<U+2191>, p<0.001). Likewise, acquisition of epithelial-like
properties, including mucin1, CK19, and ß-catenin gene expression, was also
obtained following epimorphin treatment. Further, MMP3 production was found to be
reduced whereas laminin secretion was strongly amplified upon epimorphin-induced 
MET. These results suggest there is a dosage window for actions of epimorphin on 
cellular differentiation, wherein it can either suppress or enhance epithelial
differentiation of OCCs. Importantly, induction of epithelial-like phenotypes by 
epimorphin led to an enhanced sensitivity to carboplatin. Overall, we demonstrate
that epimorphin can revert OCCs away from their mesenchymal phenotype and toward 
an epithelial phenotype, thereby enhancing their sensitivity to a front-line
chemotherapeutic agent.

Twist1 controls lung vascular permeability and endotoxin-induced pulmonary edema 
by altering Tie2 expression.

and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.

Tight regulation of vascular permeability is necessary for normal development and
deregulated vascular barrier function contributes to the pathogenesis of various 
diseases, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, cancer and inflammation.
The angiopoietin (Ang)-Tie2 pathway is known to control vascular permeability.
However, the mechanism by which the expression of Tie2 is regulated to control
vascular permeability has not been fully elucidated. Here we show that
transcription factor Twist1 modulates pulmonary vascular leakage by altering the 
expression of Tie2 in a context-dependent way. Twist1 knockdown in cultured human
lung microvascular endothelial cells decreases Tie2 expression and
phosphorylation and increases RhoA activity, which disrupts cell-cell junctional 
integrity and increases vascular permeability in vitro. In physiological
conditions, where Ang1 is dominant, pulmonary vascular permeability is elevated
in the Tie2-specific Twist1 knockout mice. However, depletion of Twist1 and
resultant suppression of Tie2 expression prevent increase in vascular
permeability in an endotoxin-induced lung injury model, where the balance of Angs
shifts toward Ang2. These results suggest that Twist1-Tie2-Angs signaling is
important for controlling vascular permeability and modulation of this mechanism 
may lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches for pulmonary edema and
other diseases caused by abnormal vascular permeability.

Subpopulation of proepicardial cells is derived from the somatic mesoderm in the 
chick embryo.

RATIONALE: The proepicardium (PE) is a transient structure forming at the venous 
pole of the heart and gives rise to the epicardium, fibroblasts, and smooth
muscle cells. The embryological origin of the PE is presently unclear.
Asymmetrical formation of the PE on the right inflow tract is a conserved feature
of many vertebrate embryos, and in the chicken is under the control of fibroblast
growth factor 8 and snail homolog 1.
OBJECTIVE: To gain further insight into the process of asymmetrical PE formation,
we studied the role of TWIST1 during PE formation in the chick embryo.
METHODS AND RESULTS: TWIST1 is asymmetrically expressed on the right side in the 
somatic mesoderm under the control of snail homolog 1. Fate mapping experiments
revealed a contribution of the somatic mesoderm to the PE. After colonization of 
the heart, this cell lineage gives rise to the epicardium, smooth muscle cells,
and potentially fibroblast. Suppression of TWIST1 function in the right coelomic 
cavity caused a severe disruption of the villous protrusions of the PE and Wilms 
tumor 1 and transcription factor 21 expression. Rescue with the corresponding
mouse cDNA normalized gene expression and PE morphology. Forced expression of
TWIST1 on the left side induced ectopic expression domains of Wilms tumor 1 and
transcription factor 21.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of the PE has its origin outside of the
currently proposed domain in the splanchnic layer of the lateral plate mesoderm. 
The phenotype in embryos subjected to TWIST1 loss- or gain-of-function suggests
an important contribution of somatic mesoderm to the mesothelial cell layer of
the PE.

PURPOSE: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition enhances tumor cell motility and has a
critical role in invasion and metastasis in a number of carcinomas. A set of
transcription factors acts as a master regulator of the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition process. To our knowledge it is unknown whether epithelial-mesenchymal
transition is important for clear cell renal cell carcinoma progression.
Therefore, we comprehensively assessed mRNA levels of epithelial-mesenchymal
transition associated genes in renal cell carcinoma as well as their prognostic
relevance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined the expression of a set of 46
epithelial-mesenchymal transition related genes by oligonucleotide microarray and
gene set enrichment analyses using RNA from 14 samples each of normal kidneys,
and G1 and G3 primary renal cell carcinomas. Expression of select
epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes was validated by real-time polymerase
chain reaction in normal kidneys, primary renal cell carcinomas and metastases in
an independent cohort of 112 patients. Results were combined with followup data
for survival analysis.
RESULTS: The epithelial-mesenchymal transition gene set was preferentially
expressed in primary renal cell carcinoma compared to normal tissue (false
discovery rate 0.01). No difference was found between G1 and G3 tumors.
Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed
down-regulation of critical epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes such as CDH2 
and ZEB1 in metastases, suggesting epithelial-mesenchymal transition reversal
during metastasis. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a better outcome in
patients with low CXCR4, vimentin, fibronectin and TWIST1 mRNA levels.
Multivariate analyses revealed that CXCR4 and VIM up-regulation represents an
independent prognostic marker for poor cancer specific survival in patients with 
renal cell carcinoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data provide strong evidence that
epithelial-mesenchymal transition occurs in renal cell carcinoma. Thus,
interference with epithelial-mesenchymal transition in renal cell carcinoma might
represent a future therapeutic option.

cell lines.

BACKGROUND: Increased motility and invasiveness of cancer cells are reminiscent
of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which occurs during cancer
progression and metastasis. Recent studies have indicated the expression of
receptor activator of nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B (RANK) in various solid tumors, including
breast cancer. Although activation of the RANK ligand (RANKL)/RANK system
promotes cell migration, metastasis, and anchorage-independent growth of
tumor-initiating cells, it remains to be investigated if RANKL induces EMT in
breast cancer cells. In this study, we investigated whether RANKL induces EMT in 
normal breast mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells, and the mechanism
underlying such induction.
METHODS: Expression levels of vimentin, N-cadherin, E-cadherin, Snail, Slug, and 
Twist were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cell migration and
invasion were assessed using Boyden chamber and invasion assays, respectively.
The effects of RANKL on signal transduction molecules were determined by western 
blot analyses.
RESULTS: We found that stimulation by RANKL altered the cell morphology to the
mesenchymal phenotype in normal breast epithelial and breast cancer cells. In
addition, RANKL increased the expression levels of vimentin, N-cadherin, Snail,
and Twist and decreased the expression of E-cadherin. We also found that RANKL
activated nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B), but not extracellular signal-regulated
kinase 1/2, Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and
signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. Moreover, dimethyl fumarate, 
a NF-<U+03BA>B inhibitor, inhibited RANKL-induced EMT, cell migration, and invasion, and
upregulated the expressions of Snail, Twist, vimentin, and N-cadherin.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that RANKL induces EMT by activating the NF-<U+03BA>B 
pathway and enhancing Snail and Twist expression. These findings suggest that the
RANKL/RANK system promotes tumor cell migration, invasion, and metastasis via the
induction of EMT.

BACKGROUND: HMLEs (HMLE-SNAIL and Kras-HMLE, Kras-HMLE-SNAIL pairs) serve as
excellent model system to interrogate the effect of SNAIL targeted agents that
reverse epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We had earlier developed a
SNAIL-p53 interaction inhibitor (GN-25) that was shown to suppress SNAIL
function. In this report, using systems biology and pathway network analysis, we 
show that GN-25 could cause reversal of EMT leading to mesenchymal-to-epithelial 
transition (MET) in a well-recognized HMLE-SNAIL and Kras-HMLE-SNAIL models.
RESULTS: GN-25 induced MET was found to be consistent with growth inhibition,
suppression of spheroid forming capacity and induction of apoptosis. Pathway
network analysis of mRNA expression using microarrays from GN-25 treated
Kras-HMLE-SNAIL cells showed an orchestrated global re-organization of EMT
network genes. The expression signatures were validated at the protein level
(down-regulation of mesenchymal markers such as TWIST1 and TWIST2 that was
concurrent with up-regulation of epithelial marker E-Cadherin), and RNAi studies 
validated SNAIL dependent mechanism of action of the drug. Most importantly,
GN-25 modulated many major transcription factors (TFs) such as inhibition of
oncogenic TFs Myc, TBX2, NR3C1 and led to enhancement in the expression of tumor 
suppressor TFs such as SMAD7, DD1T3, CEBPA, HOXA5, TFEB, IRF1, IRF7 and XBP1,
resulting in MET as well as cell death.
CONCLUSIONS: Our systems and network investigations provide convincing
pre-clinical evidence in support of the clinical application of GN-25 for the
reversal of EMT and thereby reducing cancer cell aggressiveness.

MicroRNA-106b modulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition by targeting TWIST1 in 
invasive endometrial cancer cell lines.

Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.

Type II endometrial carcinoma is an aggressive subtype of endometrial cancer
(EC). TWIST1, a helix-loop-helix transcription regulator, is known to induce
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and promote tumor metastasis. MicroRNAs
(miRNAs) also serve as important regulators of EMT and metastasis by regulating
EMT-related genes. In this study, we sought to explore the role of TWIST1 in
inducing EMT in representative type II EC cell lines, and to determine the miRNAs
involved in regulating TWIST1 gene expression. Functional analysis suggested that
TWIST1 contributes to the EMT phenotypes of EC cells, as evidenced by the
acquisition of fibroblast-like properties, enhanced invasiveness, and induction
of an EN-switch (downregulation of epithelial marker E-cadherin and upregulation 
of mesenchymal marker N-cadherin). Conversely, silencing of TWIST1 by siRNA
inhibited cell invasion and the mesenchymal phenotype, which was accompanied by a
reversion of the EN-switch. We also observed a novel post-transcriptional
regulatory mechanism of TWIST1 expression mediated by miR-106b via its direct
interaction with TWIST1 mRNAs at the 3'-untranslated region. Our data suggest
that TWIST1 is a critical inducer of EMT in invasive EC cells and that miR-106b
could suppress EC cell invasion by downregulating TWIST1 expression.

Evaluating molecular attributes in association with its epithelial and
sub-epithelial changes of oral sub-mucous fibrosis is meaningful in exploring the
plausibility of an epithelio-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignant
potentiality of this pathosis. In this study histopathological and histochemical 
attributes for basement membrane and connective tissue in biopsies of oral
sub-mucous fibrosis (n = 55) and normal oral mucosa (n = 16) were assessed and
expressions of p63, E-cadherin, ß-catenin, N-cadherin and TWIST were analyzed
immunohistochemically. The p63 and its isoforms (TA and <U+2206>N), PARD3, E-cadherin
and ß-catenin were also assessed transcriptomically by q-PCR and EMT players like
TWIST1, ZEB1, MMP9 and micro-RNA 205 were searched in gene expression
microarrays. Oral epithelium demonstrating impairment in progressive maturation
in oral sub-mucous fibrosis concomitantly experienced an increase in basement
membrane thickness and collagen deposition along with alteration in target
molecular expressions. In comparison to non-dysplastic conditions dysplastic
stages exhibited significant increase in p63 and p63<U+2206>N expressions whereas,
E-cadherin and ß-catenin exhibited loss from the membrane with concurrent
increase in cytoplasm. Further the N-cadherin and TWIST were gained remarkably
along with the appearance of nuclear accumulation features of ß-catenin. The
microarray search had noticed the up-regulation of TWIST1, ZEB1 and MMP9 along
with down regulation of micro-RNA 205. The simultaneous increase in basement
membrane thickness and sub-epithelial collagen deposition were the plausible
indicators for increased matrix stiffness with expected impact on oral epithelial
functional homoeostasis. This was corroborated with the increase in expressions
of epithelial master regulator p63 and its oncogenic isoform (<U+2206>N) along with
membranous loss of E-cadherin (EMT hallmark) and its associate ß-catein and gain 
of mesenchymal markers like N-cadherin and TWIST. These also became indicative
for the induction of epithelial to mesenchymal transitional mechanism in oral
sub-mucous fibrosis when connoted here with the relevant modulation in
expressions of EMT regulators.

Oleanolic acid suppresses migration and invasion of malignant glioma cells by
inactivating MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases/Extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(MAPK/ERK) pathway is essential for migration and invasion of malignant glioma.
It is efficient to inhibit migration and invasion of glioma cells by targeting
this pathway. Oleanolic acid (OA) has been well demonstrated to suppress
survival, growth and angiogenesis of glioma cells. However, it is still unknown
if OA affects the migration and invasion of glioma cells. We utilized U-87 MG
glioma cell lines and primary glioma cells from patients to study the effect of
OA on migration and invasion of glioma cells with multidisciplinary approaches.
In this study, we found that OA significantly decreased the ability of glioma
cells to migrate and invade. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of glioma
cells was also suppressed by OA treatment. Furthermore, MAPK/ERK pathway was
greatly inhibited in glioma cells under OA treatment. MAPK/ERK reactivation
induced by a recombinant lentiviral vector, Lv-MEK, was able to rescue the
inhibitory effect of OA on migration and invasion of glioma cells. Taken
together, we provided evidences that OA was a MAPK/ERK pathway-targeting
anti-tumor agent. Although the concentrations we used exceeded its physiological 
level, OA may be used to prevent migration and invasion of glioma cells by
developing its derivatives with enhanced bioactivity.

Expression of E-cadherin, Twist, and p53 and their prognostic value in patients
with oral squamous cell carcinoma.

PURPOSE: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and p53 play important roles in 
controlling cancer invasion and metastasis. However, discrepancies still exist in
the relationship between the expression of an epithelial marker E-cadherin and
predicting short survival of patients in many types of cancer. In this study, we 
aimed to determine the levels of E-cadherin, Twist, and p53 in tumor tissues from
patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and their clinical
significances.
METHODS: The protein expression of 112 OSCC tumor and 16 benign tissues was
examined by immunohistochemistry staining. Overall survival rates of 112 OSCC
patients were measured using Kaplan-Meier estimates and the log-rank tests.
RESULTS: E-cadherin and p53 downregulation were found in 70 of 112 (62.5 %) and
66 of 112 (59.0 %), respectively, and Twist overexpression was found in 72 of 112
(64.3 %) studied cases of OSCC patients. Expression of E-cadherin was
significantly associated with tumor location (P = 0.004) and mortality (P =
0.010). Patients with lower E-cadherin expression (P = 0.024), betel quid chewing
(P = 0.006), smoking (P = 0.001), tumor size >2 cm (P = 0.001), advanced tumor
stage (P = 0.043), and recurrence (P < 0.001) exhibited a poorer outcome.
Multivariate analysis showed that E-cadherin is an independent marker for
survival prediction. Additionally, low E-cadherin expression is significantly
correlated with low p53 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: E-cadherin is an independent marker for survival prediction in OSCC.
Co-evaluation of E-cadherin and p53 expression might be a valuable tool for
predicting OSCC patient outcome.

Twist1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, plays a key role during
development and is a master regulator of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) that promotes cancer metastasis. Structure-function relationships of Twist1
to cancer-related phenotypes are underappreciated, so we studied the requirement 
of the conserved Twist box domain for metastatic phenotypes in prostate cancer.
Evidence suggests that Twist1 is overexpressed in clinical specimens and
correlated with aggressive/metastatic disease. Therefore, we examined a
transactivation mutant, Twist1-F191G, in prostate cancer cells using in vitro
assays, which mimic various stages of metastasis. Twist1 overexpression led to
elevated cytoskeletal stiffness and cell traction forces at the migratory edge of
cells based on biophysical single-cell measurements. Twist1 conferred additional 
cellular properties associated with cancer cell metastasis including increased
migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, and anchorage-independent growth. The
Twist box mutant was defective for these Twist1 phenotypes in vitro. Importantly,
we observed a high frequency of Twist1-induced metastatic lung tumors and
extrathoracic metastases in vivo using the experimental lung metastasis assay.
The Twist box was required for prostate cancer cells to colonize metastatic lung 
lesions and extrathoracic metastases. Comparative genomic profiling revealed
transcriptional programs directed by the Twist box that were associated with
cancer progression, such as Hoxa9. Mechanistically, Twist1 bound to the Hoxa9
promoter and positively regulated Hoxa9 expression in prostate cancer cells.
Finally, Hoxa9 was important for Twist1-induced cellular phenotypes associated
with metastasis. These data suggest that the Twist box domain is required for
Twist1 transcriptional programs and prostate cancer metastasis.IMPLICATIONS:
Targeting the Twist box domain of Twist1 may effectively limit prostate cancer
metastatic potential.

CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) is one of the underlying mechanisms in
colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aimed to define a methylome signature in CRC 
through a methylation microarray analysis and a compilation of promising CIMP
markers from the literature. Illumina HumanMethylation27 (IHM27) array data was
generated and analyzed based on statistical differences in methylation data (1st 
approach) or based on overall differences in methylation percentages using lower 
95% CI (2nd approach). Pyrosequencing was performed for the validation of nine
genes. A meta-analysis was used to identify CIMP and non-CIMP markers that were
hypermethylated in CRC but did not yet make it to the CIMP genes' list. Our 1st
approach for array data analysis demonstrated the limitations in selecting genes 
for further validation, highlighting the need for the 2nd bioinformatics approach
to adequately select genes with differential aberrant methylation. A more
comprehensive list, which included non-CIMP genes, such as APC, EVL, CD109, PTEN,
TWIST1, DCC, PTPRD, SFRP1, ICAM5, RASSF1A, EYA4, 30ST2, LAMA1, KCNQ5, ADHEF1, and
TFPI2, was established. Array data are useful to categorize and cluster colonic
lesions based on their global methylation profiles; however, its usefulness in
identifying robust methylation markers is limited and rely on the data analysis
method. We have identified 16 non-CIMP-panel genes for which we provide rationale
for inclusion in a more comprehensive characterization of CIMP+ CRCs. The
identification of a definitive list for methylome specific genes in CRC will
contribute to better clinical management of CRC patients.

Autism spectrum disorder, severe behaviour problems and duplication of the Xq12
to Xq13 region have recently been described in three male relatives. To describe 
the psychiatric comorbidity and dysmorphic features, including craniosynostosis, 
of two male siblings with autism and duplication of the Xq13 to Xq21 region, and 
attempt to narrow down the number of duplicated genes proposed to be leading to
global developmental delay and autism. We performed DNA sequencing of certain
exons of the TWIST1 gene, the FGFR2 gene and the FGFR3 gene. We also performed
microarray analysis of the DNA. In addition to autism, the two male siblings
exhibited severe learning disability, self-injurious behaviour, temper tantrums
and hyperactivity, and had no communicative language. Chromosomal analyses were
normal. Neither of the two siblings showed mutations of the sequenced exons known
to produce craniosynostosis. The microarray analysis detected an extra copy of a 
region on the long arm of chromosome X, chromosome band Xq13.1-q21.1. Comparison 
of our two cases with previously described patients allowed us to identify three 
genes predisposing for autism in the duplicated chromosomal region. Sagittal
craniosynostosis is also a new finding linked to the duplication.

Emerging evidence has suggested that cancer stem cells with expression of surface
biomarkers including CD133 and CD44 have more aggressive biological behavior,
including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which are closely related to
invasion. The upregulation and nuclear relocation of the EMT regulator Twist1
have been implicated in the tumor invasion and metastasis of human hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we aimed to isolate and characterize a small
population of CD133+ cells that existed in the HCC cell line SMMC-7721 by MACS
and investigated the possible roles of 8-bromo-7-methoxychrysin (BrMC), a
synthetic analogue of chrysin, in inhibiting the properties of CD133+
sphere-forming cells (SFCs) derived from the HCC cell line SMMC-7721, namely
liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs). Based on the data, BrMC inhibited the
proliferation, self-renewal and invasion of LCSCs in vitro and in vivo,
downregulated the expression of the LCSC biomarkers CD133 and CD44 and induced
EMT by downregulating the expression of Twist and ß-catenin in LCSCs. BrMC
potentiated the inhibition of LCSCs self-renewal after reduction of twist protein
levels, which was attenuated when twist was overexpressed. This study not only
provides an important experimental and theoretical basis for investigation of
BrMC in LCSCs, but also helps in the development of effective therapeutic
medicine for HCC.

Expression of developmental genes Twist1 and Twist2 is reactivated in many human 
tumors. Among their oncogenic activities, induction of epithelial to mesenchymal 
transition is believed to increase cell motility and invasiveness and may be
related to acquisition of cancer stem cell phenotype. In addition, Twist proteins
promote malignant conversion by overriding two oncogene-induced failsafe
programs: senescence and apoptosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also
important mediators of apoptosis, senescence and motility and are tightly linked 
to disease, notably to cancer. We report here that Twist factors and ROS are
functionally linked. In wild type cells both Twist1 and Twist2 exhibit
antioxidant properties. We show that Twist-driven modulation of oncogene-induced 
apoptosis is linked to its effects on oxidative stress. Finally, we identify
several targets that mediate Twist antioxidant activity. These findings unveil a 
new function of Twist factors that could be important in explaining their
pleiotropic role during carcinogenesis.

SaethreChotzen syndrome with an atypical phenotype: identification of TWIST
microdeletion by array CGH.

Cho E, Yang TH, Shin ES, Byeon JH, Kim GH, Eun BL.

SaethreChotzen syndrome is a very rare autosomal dominant congenital disorder
characterized by craniosynostosis and acrocephalosyndactyly. It is caused by a
mutation in TWIST1, located on chromosome 7p21. A shortage of functional TWIST1
protein affects the development and maturation of cells in the skull, face, and
limbs. The patient described in this report displayed craniofacial features
classic for SaethreChotzen syndrome, including craniosynostosis, low-set ears,
small pinna with prominent crura, a high-arched palate, and a simian crease on
the left hand. He did not have the limb anomalies commonly seen in patients with 
SaethreChotzen syndrome, and the results of conventional chromosome analysis
were normal. However, results of a microarray-based comparative genomic
hybridization (array CGH) study confirmed the karyotype
of46,XY.7p21.1p15.3(15,957,375-20,331,837)x1, a region that includes TWIST1.
Subsequent fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis confirmed this result. No
other chromosome was involved in the rearrangement. This case illustrates the
important contribution of array CGH to the identification of TWIST
microdeletions, even in a patient not showing the phenotype typical of
SaethreChotzen syndrome.

We report on a female patient with an exceedingly rare combination of
achondroplasia and multiple-suture craniosynostosis. Besides the specific
features of achondroplasia, synostosis of the metopic, coronal, lambdoid, and
squamosal sutures was found. Series of neurosurgical interventions were carried
out, principally for acrocephaly and posterior plagiocephaly. The most common
achondroplasia mutation, a p.Gly380Arg in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3
(FGFR3) gene, was detected. Cytogenetic and array CGH analyses, as well as
molecular genetic testing of FGFR1, 2, 3 and TWIST1 genes failed to identify any 
additional genetic alteration. It is suggested that this unusual phenotype is a
result of variable expressivity of the common achondroplasia mutation.

Inhibition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and pulmonary fibrosis by
methacycline.

A high-throughput small-molecule screen was conducted to identify inhibitors of
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that could be used as tool compounds to
test the importance of EMT signaling in vivo during fibrogenesis. Transforming
growth factor (TGF)-ß1-induced fibronectin expression and E-cadherin repression
in A549 cells were used as 48-hour endpoints in a cell-based imaging screen.
Compounds that directly blocked Smad2/3 phosphorylation were excluded. From 2,100
bioactive compounds, methacycline was identified as an inhibitor of A549 EMT with
the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of roughly 5 µM. In vitro,
methacycline inhibited TGF-ß1-induced a-smooth muscle actin, Snail1, and collagen
I of primary alveolar epithelial cells . Methacycline inhibited TGF-ß1-induced
non-Smad pathways, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38, and Akt activation,
but not Smad or ß-catenin transcriptional activity. Methacycline had no effect on
baseline c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38, or Akt activities or lung fibroblast
responses to TGF-ß1. In vivo, 100 mg/kg intraperitoneal methacycline delivered
daily beginning 10 days after intratracheal bleomycin improved survival at Day 17
(P < 0.01). Bleomycin-induced canonical EMT markers, Snail1, Twist1, collagen I, 
as well as fibronectin protein and mRNA, were attenuated by methacycline (Day
17). Methacycline did not attenuate inflammatory cell accumulation or alter
TGF-ß1-responsive genes in alveolar macrophages. These studies identify a novel
inhibitor of EMT as a potent suppressor of fibrogenesis, further supporting the
concept that EMT signaling is important to lung fibrosis. The findings also
provide support for testing the impact of methacycline or doxycycline, an active 
analog, on progression of human pulmonary fibrosis.

Gene expression studies of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) span a decade, yet
the pathogenesis is poorly understood and diagnosis remains a challenge. This
review examines the varied approaches to gene expression analysis of CTCL, with
emphasis on cell populations, control selection and expression data collection.
Despite discordant results, several dysregulated genes have been identified
across multiple studies, including PLS3, KIR3DL2, TWIST1 and STAT4. Here, we
provide an overview of the most consistently expressed genes across different
studies and bring them together through common pathways biologically relevant to 
CTCL. Four pathways - evasion of activation-induced cell death, T helper 2
lymphocyte differentiation, transforming growth factor-ß receptor expression, and
tumour necrosis factor receptor ligands - appear to encompass the most frequently
affected genes, hypothetically providing insight into the disease pathogenesis.

The incidence of craniosynostosis is one in every 1,800-2500 births. The
gene-environment model proposes that if a genetic predisposition is coupled with 
environmental exposures, the effects can be multiplicative resulting in severely 
abnormal phenotypes. At present, very little is known about the role of
gene-environment interactions in modulating craniosynostosis phenotypes, but
prior evidence suggests a role for endocrine factors. Here we provide a report of
the effects of thyroid hormone exposure on murine calvaria cells. Murine derived 
calvaria cells were exposed to critical doses of pharmaceutical thyroxine and
analyzed after 3 and 7 days of treatment. Endpoint assays were designed to
determine the effects of the hormone exposure on markers of osteogenesis and
included, proliferation assay, quantitative ALP activity assay, targeted qPCR for
mRNA expression of Runx2, Alp, Ocn, and Twist1, genechip array for 28,853
targets, and targeted osteogenic microarray with qPCR confirmations. Exposure to 
thyroxine stimulated the cells to express ALP in a dose dependent manner. There
were no patterns of difference observed for proliferation. Targeted RNA
expression data confirmed expression increases for Alp and Ocn at 7 days in
culture. The genechip array suggests substantive expression differences for 46
gene targets and the targeted osteogenesis microarray indicated 23 targets with
substantive differences. 11 gene targets were chosen for qPCR confirmation
because of their known association with bone or craniosynostosis (Col2a1, Dmp1,
Fgf1, 2, Igf1, Mmp9, Phex, Tnf, Htra1, Por, and Dcn). We confirmed substantive
increases in mRNA for Phex, FGF1, 2, Tnf, Dmp1, Htra1, Por, Igf1 and Mmp9, and
substantive decreases for Dcn. It appears thyroid hormone may exert its effects
through increasing osteogenesis. Targets isolated suggest a possible interaction 
for those gene products associated with calvarial suture growth and homeostasis
as well as craniosynostosis.

The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a de-differentiation process
that has been implicated in metastasis and the generation of cancer initiating
cells (CICs) in solid tumors. To examine EMT in non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), we utilized a three dimensional (3D) cell culture system in which cells 
were co-stimulated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and transforming growth
factor beta (TGFß). NSCLC spheroid cultures display elevated expression of EMT
master-switch transcription factors, TWIST1, SNAI1/Snail1, SNAI2/Slug and
ZEB2/Sip1, and are highly invasive. Mesenchymal NSCLC cultures show CIC
characteristics, displaying elevated expression of transcription factors KLF4,
SOX2, POU5F1/Oct4, MYCN, and KIT. As a result, these putative CIC display a
cancer "stem-like" phenotype by forming lung metastases under limiting cell
dilution. The pleiotropic transcription factor, NF-<U+03BA>B, has been implicated in EMT
and metastasis. Thus, we set out to develop a NSCLC model to further characterize
the role of NF-<U+03BA>B activation in the development of CICs. Here, we demonstrate
that induction of EMT in 3D cultures results in constitutive NF-<U+03BA>B activity.
Furthermore, inhibition of NF-<U+03BA>B resulted in the loss of TWIST1, SNAI2, and ZEB2 
induction, and a failure of cells to invade and metastasize. Our work indicates
that NF-<U+03BA>B is required for NSCLC metastasis, in part, by transcriptionally
upregulating master-switch transcription factors required for EMT.

Cytokine responsiveness is a critical component of the ability of cells to
respond to the extracellular milieu. Transcription factor-mediated regulation of 
cytokine receptor expression is a common mode of altering responses to the
external environment. We identify the transcription factor Twist1 as a component 
of a STAT3-induced feedback loop that controls IL-6 signals by directly
repressing Il6ra. Human and mouse T cells lacking Twist1 have an increased
ability to differentiate into Th17 cells. Mice with a T cell-specific deletion of
Twist1 demonstrate increased Th17 and T follicular helper cell development, early
onset experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and increased antigen-specific
antibody responses. Thus, Twist1 has a critical role in limiting both
cell-mediated and humoral immunity.

With an increase of neoadjuvant therapy, biopsy samples have become imperative
for cancer research; however, what kind of difference between surgical and
endoscopic biopsy samples in gene expression profiles was still unclear.
Recently, we reported artificially induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(aiEMT) in the surgical samples by comparison between gene expression profiles of
both samples of the esophagus. This was also found in mouse epithelium under an
ischemic condition for 4h. This study will evoke underestimation of the
prognostic evaluation power of EMT related markers in past cancer research and
prevalence of biopsy samples for in vivo expression profiling with low biases.

OBJECTIVE: Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) can significantly improve tissue
repair by providing regeneration potential within injured cardiovascular tissue; 
however, it is challenging to obtain a sufficient amount of functional EPCs from 
aged patients for autologous stem cell therapy. To overcome this issue, we aimed 
to establish adequate ex vivo expansion protocols and identify repair modulators 
of cellular senescence. The senescence repair circuit of hypoxia-preconditioned
senescent EPCs (hyp-old EPCs) was examined in an effort to enhance their
regenerative potential.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: Long-term culturing of EPCs in normoxic conditions markedly
induced the expression of p21, whereas siRNA targeting of p21 in old EPCs
significantly enhanced the proliferation potential of cells. Hyp-old EPCs
displayed increased hypoxia-inducible factor-1a and TWIST expression. siRNA
inhibition of TWIST, a target molecule of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1a,
markedly upregulated the expression of p21 in hyp-old EPCs by reprogramming
cell-cycle regulatory proteins. In a hindlimb model of ischemia, the
transplantation of hyp-old EPCs enhanced the blood flow ratio and capillary
density, improved cellular proliferation and cell survival at ischemic sites, and
augmented the secretion of pivotal tissue angiogenic cytokines. It has been
previously demonstrated that the restoration of old EPCs from a senescent state
by hypoxia preconditioning is tightly mediated by the downregulation of p21 via
the hypoxia-inducible factor-1a-TWIST axis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study introduces ex vivo expansion protocols involving hypoxic 
preconditioning that are suitable for efficiently expanding old EPCs without
senescence through modulation of the hypoxia-induced hypoxia-inducible
factor-1a-TWIST-p21 axis. In addition, the expanded cells are shown to be useful 
for therapeutic vasculogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common
malignancy in humans and approximately 5% metastasize, usually to regional lymph 
nodes. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process involving loss of 
intercellular adhesion, acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype and enhanced
migratory potential; epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin, are down-regulated
and mesenchymal proteins (Vimentin), increased.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of EMT markers in metastatic SCC (MSCC) 
and their corresponding metastases, and to correlate them with
clinico-pathological factors associated with an increased risk of metastasis.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective study that included 146 cSCC samples (51
primary non-metastatic, 56 primary metastatic, 39 lymphatic metastases).
Immunohistochemistry for E-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail, beta-catenin, Twist, Zeb1
and Podoplanin was performed.
RESULTS: Loss of membranous E-cadherin was observed in 77% cSCCs, with no
differences between MSCC and non-MSCC. Among the transcriptional factors
controlling EMT, no significant Snail1 expression was detected. Twist, Zeb1,
Vimentin, beta-catenin and Podoplanin were significantly overexpressed in MSCCs. 
Twist ectopic expression in SCC13 cells induced Zeb1, Vimentin and Podoplanin
expression and E-cadherin delocalization. These changes resulted in a scattered
migration pattern in vitro. Expression of EMT markers was decreased in the
metastases when compared with the corresponding primary tumors.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a partial EMT, characterized by the
expression of Twist but without a total E-cadherin depletion, is involved in the 
acquisition of invasive traits by cSCC, but the process is downregulated in lymph
node metastases.

Inducible knockout of Twist1 in young and adult mice prolongs hair growth cycle
and has mild effects on general health, supporting Twist1 as a preferential
cancer target.

Twist1 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, metastasis,
stemness, and chemotherapy resistance in cancer cells and thus is a potential
target for cancer therapy. However, Twist1-null mice are embryonic lethal, and
people with one Twist1 germline mutant allele develop Saethre-Chotzen syndrome;
it is questionable whether Twist1 can be targeted in patients without severe
adverse effects. We found that Twist1 is expressed in several tissues, including 
fibroblasts of the mammary glands and dermal papilla cells of the hair follicles.
We developed a tamoxifen-inducible Twist1 knockout mouse model; Twist1 knockout
in 6-week-old female mice did not affect mammary gland morphogenesis and function
during pregnancy and lactation. In both males and females, the knockout did not
influence body weight gain, heart rate, or total lean and fat components. The
knockout also did not alter blood pressure in males, although it slightly reduced
blood pressure in females. Although Twist1 is not cyclically expressed in dermal 
papilla cells, knockout of Twist1 at postnatal day 13 (when hair follicles have
developed) drastically extended the anagen phase and accelerated hair growth.
These results indicate that Twist1 is not essential for maintaining an overall
healthy condition in young and adult mice and that loss of function facilitates
hair growth in adulthood, supporting Twist1 as a preferential target for cancer
therapy.

Multiple drug resistance (MDR) occurring during chemotherapy is a major obstacle 
for treatment of cancers using chemotherapeutic drugs; thus, the mechanisms
underlying MDR have attracted intensive attention. Many studies have shown that
tumor-initiating cells exhibit a chemotherapeutic tolerance characteristic.
However, whether the MDR cells possess tumor-initiating cells properties and its 
underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we utilized a
well-established MDR cell line K562/A02 enriched by doxorubicin from K562 cells
to determine if the K562/A02 cells possess tumor-initiating properties and
investigated its potential molecular mechanisms. We observed that the expressions
of Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog, all of which are well-characterized stem cell markers, 
in K562/A02 cells were elevated in comparison to parental K562 cells; in
addition, we found that K562/A02 cells exhibited more potent in vitro and in vivo
tumor-initiating properties, as revealed by sphere assay, self-renewal assay,
soft agar assay, and animal studies. Furthermore, our data suggest that snail and
twist1, two well known transcriptional factors for the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) program, may be potentially involved in the acquisition of
tumor-initiating properties of K562/A02 cells. Thus, our study demonstrates that 
MDR K562/A02 cells possess tumor-initiating properties, most likely due to the
elevated expressions of snail and twist1.

Hydrogen peroxide promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition and stemness in
human malignant mesothelioma cells.

College of Veterinary Medicine, Seoul National University, South Korea.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to promote mesothelial carcinogenesis
that is closely associated with asbestos fibers and inflammation. Epithelial to
mesenchymal cell transition (EMT) is an important process involved in the
progression of tumors, providing cancer cells with aggressiveness. The present
study was performed to determine if EMT is induced by H2O2 in human malignant
mesothelioma (HMM) cells. Cultured HMM cells were treated with H2O2, followed by 
measuring expression levels of EMT-related genes and proteins.
Immunohistochemically, TWIST1 expression was confined to sarcomatous cells in HMM
tissues, but not in epithelioid cells. Treatment of HMM cells with H2O2 promoted 
EMT, as indicated by increased expression levels of vimentin, SLUG and TWIST1,
and decreased E-cadherin expression. Expression of stemness genes such as OCT4,
SOX2 and NANOG was also significantly increased by treatment of HMM cells with
H2O2. Alteration of these genes was mediated via activation of hypoxia inducible 
factor 1 alpha (HIF-1a) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-ß1).
Considering that treatment with H2O2 results in excess ROS, the present study
suggests that oxidative stress may play a critical role in HMM carcinogenesis by 
promoting EMT processes and enhancing the expression of stemness genes.

Twist, the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is involved in the
process of epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMTs), which play an essential 
role in cancer metastasis. Overexpression of Twist or its promoter methylation is
a common scenario in metastatic carcinomas. Twist is activated by a variety of
signal transduction pathways, including Akt, signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3, mitogen-activated protein kinase, Ras, and Wnt signaling.
Activated Twist upregulates N-cadherin and downregulates E-cadherin, which are
the hallmarks of EMT. Moreover, Twist plays an important role in some
physiological processes involved in metastasis, like angiogenesis, invadopodia,
extravasation, and chromosomal instability. Twist also protects cancer cells from
apoptotic cell death. In addition, Twist is responsible for the stemness of
cancer cells and the generation of drug resistance. Recently, targeting Twist has
gained significant interests in cancer therapeutics. The inactivation of Twist by
small RNA technology or chemotherapeutic approach has been proved successful.
Moreover, several inhibitors which are antagonistic to the upstream or downstream
molecules of Twist signaling pathways have also been identified. Development of
potential treatment strategies by targeting Twist has a great promise in cancer
therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-secreting hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC)
represent a genetically distinct subset of tumors often associated with a worse
prognosis. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie these phenotypic
differences remain poorly understood.
METHODS: HCC tumor samples from 27 patients were profiled using the Affymetrix
133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips. GeneGO Metacore software was used to identify altered
biologic pathways. Expression validation was confirmed by RT-PCR. Manipulation of
miR-675 by overexpression and antagomir-mediated knockdown was carried out with
subsequent evaluation of effects on cell behavior by cell cycle, proliferation,
invasion, and growth in soft agar assays.
RESULTS: We identified a strong relationship between primary tumor H19 gene
expression and elevated serum AFP. H19 has recently been identified to encode
microRNA-675 (miR-675), and we confirmed the relationship in an independent
sample of patients. Pathway analyses of the effect of miR-675 overexpression in
hepatoma cells revealed a predominant upregulation of cell adhesion and cell
cycle initiation pathways. We have demonstrated that miR-675 mediates increases
in proliferation and an accumulation of cells with tetraploid DNA content
associated with a repression of Rb. We also demonstrated that overexpression of
miR-675 alters cellular morphology, reduces invasive potential, and increases
anchorage-independent growth capacity. These findings are consistent with a
mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, associated with a reduction in the
expression of the key EMT mediator, Twist1.
CONCLUSIONS: Expression of the miR-675 in hepatocellular carcinoma links a
dramatic upregulation of proliferative and growth capacity with inhibition of
motility in HCC cells.

Resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibition is a common phenomenon in melanoma.
Cytokines and transcription factors have been attributed to contribute to the
loss of sensitivity towards these inhibitors. Here, we show that transforming
growth factor (TGF)-ß1 if combined with PLX4032, a BRAF inhibitor, or GSK1120212,
a MEK inhibitor, substantially increased cell death in BRAF-mutant melanoma cell 
lines. This increase was based on the combined regulatory decrease in Twist1, an 
antiapoptotic protein. Overexpression or silencing of Twist1 attenuated or
aggravated induction of apoptosis through PLX4032 or GSK1120212, respectively.
Exposure to tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a, however, led to increased Twist1
levels and oppositional decrease in cell death if exposed to PLX4032 or
GSK1120212. This increase in drug resistance again depended on Twist1 levels. Our
studies suggest that Twist1 as a common downstream target of multiple signalling 
cascades plays a crucial role in mediating drug resistance to BRAF- and
MEK-targeted molecular inhibitors.

Trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) is a member of the TFF-domain peptide family and
essential in regulating cell migration and maintaining mucosal integrity in
gastrointestinal tract. However, the role of TFF3 and its downstream regulating
mechanisms in cancer cell migration remain unclear. We previously reported that
TFF3 prolonged the up-regulation of Twist protein to modulate IL-8 secretion in
intestinal epithelial cells. In this study, we investigated the role of Twist
protein in TFF3-induced migration of SGC7901 cells. While Twist was activated by 
TFF3, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Twist abolished TFF3-induced cell migration.
Furthermore, the migration related marker CK-8 as well as ZO-1 and MMP-9 was also
regulated by TFF3 via a Twist-dependent mechanism. Our study suggests that Twist,
as an important potential downstream effector, plays a key role in TFF3-modulated
metastasis in gastric cancer and can be a promising therapeutic target against
intestinal-type gastric cancer.

expression and enhances tumor malignancy.

The circadian clock gene Period2 (PER2) has been suggested to be a tumor
suppressor. However, detailed mechanistic evidence has not been provided to
support this hypothesis. We found that loss of PER2 enhanced invasion and
activated expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes including
TWIST1, SLUG, and SNAIL. This finding was corroborated by clinical observation
that PER2 down-regulation was associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer
patients. We further demonstrated that PER2 served as a transcriptional
corepressor, which recruited polycomb proteins EZH2 and SUZ12 as well as HDAC2 to
octamer transcription factor 1 (OCT1) (POU2F1) binding sites of the TWIST1 and
SLUG promoters to repress expression of these EMT genes. Hypoxia, a condition
commonly observed in tumors, caused PER2 degradation and disrupted the PER2
repressor complex, leading to activation of EMT gene expression. This result was 
further supported by clinical data showing a significant negative correlation
between hypoxia and PER2. Thus, our findings clearly demonstrate the tumor
suppression function of PER2 and elucidate a pathway by which hypoxia promotes
EMT via degradation of PER2.

TrkC promotes survival and growth of leukemia cells through Akt-mTOR-dependent
up-regulation of PLK-1 and Twist-1.

It has been suggested that activation of receptor PTKs is important for
leukemogenesis and leukemia cell response to targeted therapy in hematological
malignancies including leukemia. PTKs induce activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway, which can result in prevention of apoptosis. Here, we describe an
important role of the TrkC-associated molecular network in the process of
leukemogenesis. TrkC was found to be frequently overexpressed in human leukemia
cells and leukemia subtypes. In U937 human leukemia cells, blockade of TrkC using
small hairpin RNA (shRNA) specific to TrkC or K562a, a specific inhibitor of
TrkC, resulted in a significant decrease in growth and survival of the cells,
which was closely associated with reduced mTOR level and Akt activity. In
addition, TrkC enhances the survival and proliferation of leukemia, which is
correlated with activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, TrkC significantly 
inhibits apoptosis via induction of the expression of PLK-1 and Twist-1 through
activation of AKT/mTor pathway; therefore, it plays a key role in leukemogenesis.
These findings reveal an unexpected physiological role for TrkC in the
pathogenesis of leukemia and have important implications for understanding
various hematological malignancies.

Association of URG11 and Twist with clinical pathological characteristics and
prognosis in patients with IgA nephropathy.

Author information:

Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China.

BACKGROUND: Our previous studies demonstrated that URG11 is involved in
hypoxia-induced tubular epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the development of 
kidney fibrosis in cellular and animal models. The objective of this study was to
determine the expression levels of URG11 in kidneys with IgA nephropathy (IgAN), 
and the association of URG11 with various clinical parameters.
METHODS: We analysed the degree of expression and localization of URG11 in
biopsies from kidneys with IgAN, and correlated their immunostaining levels with 
various clinical and histological parameters. We also analysed the correlation
between the expression of URG11 and Twist in the renal interstitium with renal
survival.
RESULTS: URG11 was strongly expressed in the cytoplasm of tubular epithelial
cells obtained from kidneys of patients with IgAN. However, there was little
positive staining for URG11 in the renal tubules of normal kidneys (P = 0.024).
URG11 protein levels in the tubulointerstitium were inversely correlated with
estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) (r = -0.305, P = 0.038) and the
percentage of tubulointerstitial fibrosis (r = 0.350, P = 0.023). Moreover, a
high level of URG11 correlated with the activation of Twist expression and
E-cadherin repression in patients with IgAN (P = 0.000 and 0.041, respectively). 
Multivariate analyses indicated that a combination of high URG11 and Twist
expression was an independent prognostic factor [relative ratio, RR 4.738 (95%
CI: 1.040, 21.591), P = 0.044] of IgAN.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that URG11 staining in renal biopsy specimens
might be a novel histological marker for progression in IgAN patients.

Bcl-w Enhances Mesenchymal Changes and Invasiveness of Glioblastoma Cells by
Inducing Nuclear Accumulation of ß-Catenin.

Medical Sciences, Seoul, Korea.

Bcl-w a pro-survival member of the Bcl-2 protein family, is expressed in a
variety of cancer types, including gastric and colorectal adenocarcinomas, as
well as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and lethal brain tumor
type. Previously, we demonstrated that Bcl-w is upregulated in gastric cancer
cells, particularly those displaying infiltrative morphology. These reports
propose that Bcl-w is strongly associated with aggressive characteristic, such as
invasive or mesenchymal phenotype of GBM. However, there is no information from
studies of the role of Bcl-w in GBM. In the current study, we showed that Bcl-w
is upregulated in human glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV) tissues, compared 
with normal and glioma (WHO grade III) tissues. Bcl-w promotes the mesenchymal
traits of glioblastoma cells by inducing vimentin expression via activation of
transcription factors, ß-catenin, Twist1 and Snail in glioblastoma U251 cells.
Moreover, Bcl-w induces invasiveness by promoting MMP-2 and FAK activation via
the PI3K-p-Akt-p-GSK3ß-ß-catenin pathway. We further confirmed that Bcl-w has the
capacity to induce invasiveness in several human cancer cell lines. In
particular, Bcl-w-stimulated ß-catenin is translocated into the nucleus as a
transcription factor and promotes the expression of target genes, such as
mesenchymal markers or MMPs, thereby increasing mesenchymal traits and
invasiveness. Our findings collectively indicate that Bcl-w functions as a
positive regulator of invasiveness by inducing mesenchymal changes and that
trigger their aggressiveness of glioblastoma cells.

We observed a patient with a Saethre-Chotzen-like phenotype with severe
neurological features. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (acrocephalosyndactyly type III; 
SCS; OMIM #101400) is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndrome
characterized by craniofacial and mild limb abnormalities. The phenotypic
features of chromosomal microdeletions involving the 7p21.1, where the twist
homolog 1 gene (TWIST1) responsible for SCS is located, are recognized as a
contiguous gene deletion syndrome with SCS and other phenotypic manifestations.
In this study, we identified microdeletions in 4q13.2 and 7p21.1 in a patient
with SCS and severe neurological features including developmental delay and
autistic behavior. In comparison to other SCS patients with intragenic mutations 
or small deletions in 7p21.1, neurological features seen in this patient were
extremely severe, likely modified by a concurrent deletion of 4q13.2. Both
microdeletions were de novo and paternal in origin. Further information on such
concurrent chromosomal deletions should be accumulated for better understanding
of the mechanism.

Sox2 suppresses the invasiveness of breast cancer cells via a mechanism that is
dependent on Twist1 and the status of Sox2 transcription activity.

BACKGROUND: Sox2, an embryonic stem cell marker, is aberrantly expressed in a
subset of breast cancer (BC). While the aberrant expression of Sox2 has been
shown to significantly correlate with a number of clinicopathologic parameters in
BC, its biological significance in BC is incompletely understood.
METHODS: In-vitro invasion assay was used to evaluate whether the expression of
Sox2 is linked to the invasiveness of MCF7 and ZR751 cells. Quantitative reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and/or Western blots were used 
to assess if Sox2 modulates the expression of factors known to regulate
epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), such as Twist1. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was used to assess the binding of Sox2 to the promoter
region of Twist1.
RESULTS: We found that siRNA knockdown of Sox2 expression significantly increased
the invasiveness of MCF7 and ZR751 cells. However, when MCF7 cells were separated
into two distinct subsets based on their differential responsiveness to the Sox2 
reporter, the Sox2-mediated effects on invasiveness was observed only in
'reporter un-responsive' cells (RU cells) but not 'reporter responsive' cells (RR
cells). Correlating with these findings, siRNA knockdown of Sox2 in RU cells, but
not RR cells, dramatically increased the expression of Twist1. Accordingly, using
ChIP, we found evidence that Sox2 binds to the promoter region of Twist1 in RU
cells only. Lastly, siRNA knockdown of Twist1 largely abrogated the regulatory
effect of Sox2 on the invasiveness in RU cells, suggesting that the observed
Sox2-mediated effects are Twist1-dependent.
CONCLUSION: Sox2 regulates the invasiveness of BC cells via a mechanism that is
dependent on Twist1 and the transcriptional status of Sox2. Our results have
further highlighted a new level of biological complexity and heterogeneity of BC 
cells that may carry significant clinical implications.

activity.

Sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2) is well known as one of the "stemness"
factors and is often expressed in cancers including breast cancer. In this study,
we developed a reporter system using fluorescent protein driven by the promoter
for SOX2 gene to detect and isolate living SOX2-positive cells. Using this
system, we determined that SOX2 promoter activities were well correlated with
SOX2 mRNA expression levels in 5 breast cancer cell lines, and that the cell
population with positive SOX2 promoter activity (pSp-T(+)) isolated from one of
the 5 cell lines, MCF-7 cells, showed a high SOX2 protein expression and high
sphere-forming activity compared with very low promoter activity (pSp-T(low/-)). 
The pSp-T(+) population expressed higher mRNA levels of several stemness-related 
genes such as CD44, ABCB1, NANOG and TWIST1 than the pSp-T(low/-) population
whereas the two populations expressed CD24 at similar levels. These results
suggest that the cell population with SOX2 promoter activity contains cancer stem
cell (CSC)-like cells which show different expression profiles from those of
CSC-marker genes previously recognized in human breast cancers.

BACKGROUND: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) still remains an obscure
event in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC).
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression of E-cadherin, ß-catenin, Snail,
Slug, Twist and Vimentin was analysed in 87 VSCC, controlled for human
papillomavirus (HPV) positivity, considering tumour front and central tumour as
different morphological categories from the same tumour.
RESULTS: Lower ß-catenin and higher Vimentin expression was associated with
invasive front when compared with the central tumour (P=0.013 and P=0.001,
respectively). Higher expression of E-cadherin in central tumour was
significantly related to absence of vascular and perineural invasion, lower
invasion depth and =2 lymph node involvement. Loss of ß-catenin and high Slug,
Snail and Twist expression was associated with HPV-negative tumours. Moreover,
ß-catenin lower expression associated with gain in Slug expression predicts a
subgroup with worst outcome (P=0.001). Lower expression of ß-catenin in both
central tumour and invasive front correlated with lower overall survival (P=0.021
and P=0.011, respectively). Also, multivariate analysis showed that lower
ß-catenin expression was independently associated with poorer outcome (P=0.044).
CONCLUSION: Human papillomavirus-related tumours show better prognosis and
outcome; besides, they do not progress through EMT phenomenon.
Immunohistochemical analysis of ß-catenin in invasive tumour front is a key issue
for establishing prognosis of vulva cancer.

Interaction between docetaxel resistance and castration resistance in prostate
cancer: implications of Twist1, YB-1, and androgen receptor.

BACKGROUND: Taxanes, including docetaxel, are currently the only cytotoxic
chemotherapeutic agents proven to confer survival benefit in patients with
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, the merits of taxanes
remain modest, and efforts are needed to improve their therapeutic efficacy.
METHODS: We evaluated the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to various agents 
using cytotoxicity assays. Gene and protein expression levels were evaluated by
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analysis,
respectively.
RESULTS: Hydrogen peroxide-resistant and castration-resistant cells that
overexpressed Twist1 and Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) were cross-resistant to
cytotoxic agents, including docetaxel. Twist1 regulated YB-1 expression in
prostate cancer cells, supported by the induction of Twist1 and YB-1 by
transforming-growth factor-ß, which is critical for taxane resistance. Twist1
and/or YB-1 were activated in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells, and YB-1
was activated by docetaxel treatment. Conversely, Twist1 and YB-1 knockdown
sensitized prostate cancer cells to cytotoxic agents, including docetaxel. In
addition, androgen receptor (AR) knockdown increased cellular sensitivity to
docetaxel, though AR expression in docetaxel-resistant LNCaP cells was
paradoxically lower than in parental cells. Intriguingly, androgen deprivation
treatment was more effective in docetaxel-resistant LNCaP cells compared with
parental cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Twist1/YB-1 and AR signaling promote docetaxel resistance in CRPC
cells. However, docetaxel-resistant cells were collaterally sensitive to androgen
deprivation because of down-regulation of AR expression, suggesting that the
therapeutic effect of initial taxane treatment in hormone-naïve prostate cancer
may be superior to that of salvage taxane treatment in CRPC.

Paulo, Brazil.

There is some evidence of Twist participation in oral carcinogenesis; however,
little is known about its interaction with E-cadherin in oral squamous cell
carcinoma (OSCC) development. This experimental study included an
immunohistochemical analysis of Twist and E-cadherin proteins in
paraffin-embedded specimens of oral leukoplakia (OL), OSCC, and normal oral
mucosa. In addition, it was also performed a Western blot and
double-immunofluorescence analysis of Twist and E-cadherin expression in OSCC
cell lines. Significant differences in Twist and E-cadherin immunoexpression were
observed between normal oral mucosa and OL, with an inverse relation since the
earliest stages of oral dysplasia (r = -0,512; P < 0.001). Western blot and
double-immunofluorescence analysis showed differences in Twist and E-cadherin
expression among human oral keratinocytes and OSCC cell lines suggesting that
downregulation of E-cadherin occurs in a dependent manner of Twist in OSCC. Our
results showed a possible value of Twist and E-cadherin in the prediction of risk
of oral epithelium malignant transformation.

line by AKT activation.

In addition to potent anticancer effects of selenite, a modest therapeutic effect
of sodium selenate has been demonstrated in prostate cancer patients. Selenate
acts by activating protein phosphatase 2A, which inhibits various signal
transduction cascades, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT
pathway. The human colorectal carcinoma cell line DLD-1 harbors a constitutive
active mutation in PIK3CA encoding the PI3K p110a catalytic subunit. Thus, we
examined the anticancer effect of sodium selenate in DLD-1 cells. As expected,
selenate significantly decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis at a 50% 
inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.88mM, whereas selenite was much more potent 
at an IC50 of 0.0061mM. Surprisingly, at lower concentrations (0.04-0.16mM),
selenate induced changes in cell morphology and motility that are characteristic 
of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, selenate-induced EMT
was associated with AKT activation, increased expression of the EMT-inducing
transcription factor TWIST1 and the mesenchymal cell-specific intermediate
filament vimentin, and decreased expression of the epithelial cell-specific
adhesion molecule E-cadherin. The critical role of AKT activation in
selenate-induced EMT was identified using the AKT inhibitor Akti-1/2, which
suppressed EMT-associated cell motility and invasion. These results suggest that 
although sodium selenate is a potential anticancer drug, deleterious effects of
EMT induction should be taken into careful consideration.

The proto-oncogene TWIST1 is regulated by microRNAs.

Upregulation of the proto-oncogene Twist1 is highly correlated with acquired drug
resistance and poor prognosis in human cancers. Altered expression of this
multifunctional transcription factor is also associated with inherited skeletal
malformations. The mammalian Twist1 3'UTRs are highly conserved and contain a
number of potential regulatory elements including miRNA target sites. We analyzed
the translational regulation of TWIST1 using luciferase reporter assays in a
variety of cell lines. Among several miRNAs tested, miR-145a-5p, miR-151-5p and a
combination of miR-145a-5p + miR-151-5p and miR-151-5p + miR-337-3p were able to 
significantly repress Twist1 translation. This phenomena was confirmed with both 
exogenous and endogenous miRNAs and was dependent on the presence of the
predicted target sites in the 3'UTR. Furthermore, the repression was sensitive to
LNA-modified miRNA antagonists and resulted in decreased migratory potential of
murine embryonic fibroblast cells. Understanding the in vivo mechanisms of this
oncogene's regulation might open up a possibility for therapeutic interference by
gene specific cancer therapies.

Molecular Analysis of Twist1 and FGF Receptors in a Rabbit Model of
Craniosynostosis: Likely Exclusion as the Loci of Origin.

Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of the cranial vault sutures. We have
previously described a colony of rabbits with a heritable pattern of
nonsyndromic, coronal suture synostosis; however, the underlying genetic defect
remains unknown. We now report a molecular analysis to determine if four genes
implicated in human craniosynostosis, TWIST1 and fibroblast growth factor
receptors 1-3 (FGFR1-3), could be the loci of the causative mutation in this
unique rabbit model. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified
within the Twist1, FGFR1, and FGFR2 genes, and the allelic patterns of these
silent mutations were examined in 22 craniosynostotic rabbits. SNP analysis of
the Twist1, FGFR1, and FGFR2 genes indicated that none were the locus of origin
of the craniosynostotic phenotype. In addition, no structural mutations were
identified by direct sequence analysis of Twist1 and FGFR3 cDNAs. These data
indicate that the causative locus for heritable craniosynostosis in this rabbit
model is not within the Twist1, FGFR1, and FGFR2 genes. Although a locus in
intronic or flanking sequences of FGFR3 remains possible, no direct structural
mutation was identified for FGFR3.

Malignant cell transformation, invasion, and metastasis are dependent on the
coordinated rewiring of gene expression. A major component in the scaffold of
these reprogramming events is one in which epithelial cells lose intercellular
connections and polarity to adopt a more motile mesenchymal phenotype, which is
largely supported by a robust transcriptional machinery consisting mostly of
developmental transcription factors. This study demonstrates that the winged
helix transcription factor, FOXQ1, contributes to this rewiring process, in part 
by directly modulating the transcription of TWIST1, itself a key mediator of
metastasis that transcriptionally regulates the expression of important molecules
involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Forced expression and
RNA-mediated silencing of FOXQ1 led to enhanced and suppressed mRNA and protein
levels of TWIST1, respectively. Mechanistically, FOXQ1 enhanced the reporter
activity of TWIST1 and directly interacted with its promoter. Furthermore,
enhanced expression of FOXQ1 resulted in increased migration and invasion in
colorectal cancer cell lines, whereas knockdown studies showed the opposite
effect. Moreover, using the in vivo chicken chorioallantoic membrane metastasis
assay model, FOXQ1 significantly enhanced distant metastasis with minimal effects
on tumor growth.IMPLICATIONS: These findings reveal FOXQ1 as a modulator of
TWIST1-mediated metastatic phenotypes and support its potential as a biomarker of
metastasis.

Hypoxia: a master regulator of microRNA biogenesis and activity.

Nallamshetty S(1), Chan SY, Loscalzo J.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 
Boston, MA 02115, USA.

Hypoxia, or low oxygen tension, is a unique environmental stress that induces
global changes in a complex regulatory network of transcription factors and
signaling proteins to coordinate cellular adaptations in metabolism,
proliferation, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Several lines of evidence now establish
microRNAs (miRNAs), which are short noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression 
through posttranscriptional mechanisms, as key elements in this response to
hypoxia. Oxygen deprivation induces a distinct shift in the expression of a
specific group of miRNAs, termed hypoxamirs, and emerging evidence indicates that
hypoxia regulates several facets of hypoxamir transcription, maturation, and
function. Transcription factors such as hypoxia-inducible factor are upregulated 
under conditions of low oxygen availability and directly activate the
transcription of a subset of hypoxamirs. Conversely, hypoxia selectively
represses other hypoxamirs through less well characterized mechanisms. In
addition, oxygen deprivation has been directly implicated in epigenetic
modifications such as DNA demethylation that control specific miRNA
transcription. Finally, hypoxia also modulates the activity of key proteins that 
control posttranscriptional events in the maturation and activity of miRNAs.
Collectively, these findings establish hypoxia as an important proximal regulator
of miRNA biogenesis and function. It will be important for future studies to
address the relative contributions of transcriptional and posttranscriptional
events in the regulation of specific hypoxamirs and how such miRNAs are
coordinated in order to integrate into the complex hierarchical regulatory
network induced by hypoxia.

line SKOV3.

Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal female malignancies and epigenetic
abnormalities are thought to play a vital role in the pathogenesis, development
and progression of ovarian cancer. Our goal was to investigate whether the
combination of trichostatin A (TSA) and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) was
superior to single agent on tumorigenicity of ovarian cancer cells. We found that
tumorigenicity and metastasis of SKOV3 cells were significantly suppressed by the
combination of TSA and decitabine in xenograft mouse models. Migration capacity
was markedly suppressed through the induction of E-cadherin and suppression of
N-cadherin when treated with TSA and decitabine. Invasion was also suppressed at 
least partially through inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 with the combined
treatment. The combination drugs markedly inhibited spheroid formation and
significantly impaired migration and invasion capacity of spheroid derived cells 
through inhibition of Twist, N-cadherin, MMP-2, MMP-9 and induction of
E-cadherin. Epigenetically, the activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and
histone deacetylases (HDACs) were markedly inhibited when TSA was used in
combination with decitabine, especially the expression of DNMT3A/3B and HDAC1/2. 
Acetylation of histone H3 and H4 were more markedly stimulated with the
combination than with either agent alone. The expression level of lysine-specific
demethylase-1 (LSD1) was also suppressed. The transcription activity marker
dimethylated-H3K4 was induced, but the dimethylated-H3K9 was suppressed by
exposure to the combined drugs. These results suggest that the combination of TSA
and decitabine significantly suppresses tumorigenicity by inhibiting migration
and invasion of ovarian cancer cells via regulating the expression of the
cadherins and MMPs, which may be epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation and 
histone modification.

Lipocalin-2 negatively modulates the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in
hepatocellular carcinoma through the epidermal growth factor
(TGF-beta1)/Lcn2/Twist1 pathway.

Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Chonbuk National University Medical
School and Hospital, Jeonju, Jeonbuk, South Korea.

Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2) is preferentially expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
However, the functional role of Lcn2 in HCC progression is still poorly
understood, particularly with respect to its involvement in invasion and
metastasis. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Lcn2 is
associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC and to
elucidate the underlying signaling pathway(s). Lcn2 was preferentially expressed 
in well-differentiated HCC versus liver cirrhosis tissues, and its expression was
positively correlated with the stage of HCC. The characteristics of EMT were
reversed by adenoviral transduction of Lcn2 into SH-J1 cells, including the
down-regulation of N-cadherin, vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and
fibronectin, and the concomitant up-regulation of CK8, CK18, and desmoplakin
I/II. Knockdown of Lcn2 by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in HKK-2 cells expressing
high levels of Lcn2 was associated with EMT. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) or
transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-ß1) treatment resulted in down-regulation
of Lcn2, accompanied by an increase in Twist1 expression and EMT in HCC cells.
Stable Lcn2 expression in SH-J1 cells reduced Twist1 expression, inhibited cell
proliferation and invasion in vitro, and suppressed tumor growth and metastasis
in a mouse model. Furthermore, EGF or TGF-ß1 treatment barely changed EMT marker 
expression in SH-J1 cells ectopically expressing Lcn2. Ectopic expression of
Twist1 induced EMT marker expression even in cells expressing Lcn2, indicating
that Lcn2 functions downstream of growth factors and upstream of
Twist1.CONCLUSION: Together, our findings indicate that Lcn2 can negatively
modulate the EMT in HCC cells through an EGF (or TGF-ß1)/Lcn2/Twist1 pathway.
Thus, Lcn2 may be a candidate metastasis suppressor and a potential therapeutic

WAVE2 regulates epithelial morphology and cadherin isoform switching through
regulation of Twist and Abl.

Tennessee, United States of America.

BACKGROUND: Epithelial morphogenesis is a dynamic process that involves
coordination of signaling and actin cytoskeletal rearrangements.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed the contribution of the branched actin regulator 
WAVE2 in the development of 3-dimensional (3D) epithelial structures.
WAVE2-knockdown (WAVE2-KD) cells formed large multi-lobular acini that continued 
to proliferate at an abnormally late stage compared to control acini.
Immunostaining of the cell-cell junctions of WAVE2-KD acini revealed weak and
heterogeneous E-cadherin staining despite little change in actin filament
localization to the same junctions. Analysis of cadherin expression demonstrated 
a decrease in E-cadherin and an increase in N-cadherin protein and mRNA abundance
in total cell lysates. In addition, WAVE2-KD cells exhibited an increase in the
mRNA levels of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated
transcription factor Twist1. KD of Twist1 expression in WAVE2-KD cells reversed
the cadherin switching and completely rescued the aberrant 3D morphological
phenotype. Activity of the WAVE2 complex binding partner Abl kinase was also
increased in WAVE2-KD cells, as assessed by tyrosine phosphorylation of the Abl
substrate CrkL. Inhibition of Abl with STI571 rescued the multi-lobular WAVE2-KD 
3D phenotype whereas overexpression of Abl kinase phenocopied the WAVE2-KD
phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: The WAVE2 complex regulates breast epithelial morphology by a
complex mechanism involving repression of Twist1 expression and Abl kinase
activity. These data reveal a critical role for WAVE2 complex in regulation of
cellular signaling and epithelial morphogenesis.

Recruitment of normal stem cells to an oncogenic phenotype by noncontiguous
carcinogen-transformed epithelia depends on the transforming carcinogen.

Program, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes

Carolina, USA.

BACKGROUND: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) drive tumor initiation, progression, and
metastasis. The microenvironment is critical to the fate of CSCs. We have found
that a normal stem cell (NSC) line from human prostate (WPE-stem) is recruited
into CSC-like cells by nearby, but noncontiguous, arsenic-transformed isogenic
malignant epithelial cells (MECs).
OBJECTIVE: It is unknown whether this recruitment of NSCs into CSCs by noncontact
co-culture is specific to arsenic-transformed MECs. Thus, we used co-culture to
examine the effects of neighboring noncontiguous cadmium-transformed MECs
(Cd-MECs) and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-transformed MECs (MNU-MECs) on NSCs.
RESULTS: After 2 weeks of noncontact Cd-MEC co-culture, NSCs showed elevated
metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and MMP-2 secretion, increased invasiveness,
increased colony formation, decreased PTEN expression, and formation of
aggressive, highly branched duct-like structures from single cells in Matrigel,
all characteristics typical of cancer cells. These oncogenic characteristics did 
not occur in NSCs co-cultured with MNU-MECs. The NSCs co-cultured with Cd-MECs
retained self-renewal capacity, as evidenced by multiple passages (> 3) of
structures formed in Matrigel. Cd-MEC-co-cultured NSCs also showed molecular
(increased VIM, SNAIL1, and TWIST1 expression; decreased E-CAD expression) and
morphologic evidence of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition typical for
conversion to CSCs. Dysregulated expression of SC-renewal genes, including ABCG2,
OCT-4, and WNT-3, also occurred in NSCs during oncogenic transformation induced
by noncontact co-culture with Cd-MECs.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that Cd-MECs can recruit nearby NSCs into a
CSC-like phenotype, but MNU-MECs do not. Thus, the recruitment of NSCs into CSCs 
by nearby MECs is dependent on the carcinogen originally used to malignantly
transform the MECs.

Presence of Twist1-positive neoplastic cells in the stroma of chromosome-unstable
colorectal tumors.

G, Roncalli M, Mantovani A, Malesci A, Laghi L.

Author information:

Center, Rozzano, Italy.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cancer cells undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) to become invasive, allowing tumors to progress. However, there is no
direct evidence that human cancer cells undergo an EMT. In mouse cancer cells,
up-regulation of transcription factor Twist1 was shown to promote an EMT. We
searched the stroma of human colorectal tumor samples for TWIST1-positive cells
with a mesenchymal phenotype and neoplastic genotype.
METHODS: We measured the expression of TWIST1 in human colorectal cancer (CRC)
cell lines and examined the effects of overexpression or knockdown in vitro and
in mice. We used immunohistochemistry to measure levels of TWIST1 in 201
colorectal tumor samples. In 20 samples, immunostaining was combined with
fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses. Levels of TWIST1 messenger RNA
(mRNA) were measured in blood samples from 15 patients.
RESULTS: TWIST1 was required to maintain the mesenchymal phenotype and
invasiveness of the microsatellite-stable CoLo741 cells (which express endogenous
TWIST1) and SW480 (expressing transgenic TWIST1). TWIST1 mRNA was not translated 
in CRC cells with microsatellite instability (HCT116). Syngenic TWIST1-positive
colon carcinoma cells (CT26) that invaded tissues surrounding tumors acquired a
mesenchymal phenotype. The presence of TWIST1-positive cells in the stroma of
human colorectal tumors correlated with microsatellite stability (P = .05), stage
IV cancer (P = .02), and disease-free survival time (P < .01). Trisomies of
chromosome 7 and/or chromosome 20 were detected in 17 of 20 colorectal tumor
samples, each of which contained TWIST1-positive cells with matching chromosomal 
gains in the tumor stroma (86 of 776 counted cells; 11.1%). No trisomy was
observed in TWIST1-negative stromal cells (0 of 1249 cells; P < .001). Levels of 
TWIST1 mRNA were significantly higher in blood samples from patients with CRC
than controls.
CONCLUSIONS: The stroma of human colorectal tumors contains TWIST1-positive
cancer cells with mesenchymal phenotypes. Patients with CRC have higher levels of
TWIST1 mRNA than healthy individuals.

Twist1 in tumor cells and a-smooth muscle actin in stromal cells are possible
biomarkers for metastatic giant basal cell carcinoma.

We previously reported a case of giant basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in a
75-year-old Japanese man, who subsequently developed a pulmonary metastasis. With
regard to the pathogenesis of metastasis of BCC, recently, it has been reported
that high levels of expression of Twist1 and N-cadherin in primary and metastatic
tumor cells, suggesting that Twist1 expression and an epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) of tumor cells are important for the promotion of tumor invasion
and subsequent metastasis. In this report, we identified the expressions of
Twist1 in tumor cells and a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) in stromal cells in the
primary and metastatic sites of giant BCC. These results suggest that
Twist1-induced EMT of tumor cells might have been associated with distant organ
metastasis in our case, and the presence of a-SMA-positive myofibroblasts
surrounding a BCC nest can be one of hallmarks of the aggressiveness of BCC.

Hypermethylation of TWIST1 and NID2 in tumor tissues and voided urine in urinary 
bladder cancer patients.

Yegin Z(1), Gunes S, Buyukalpelli R.

Author information:

Bladder cancer like other cancers arises from the accumulation of many genetic
and epigenetic changes that lead to the activation of proto-oncogenes or
inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. We aimed to investigate the methylation
patterns of Twist homolog 1 (TWIST1) and nidogen-2 (NID2) genes in bladder
cancer. Fifty six histologically confirmed bladder tumor samples and paired 24
urine samples constituted the study group and was compared with 15 age- and
gender-matched noncancerous individuals. DNA was purified from both tumor and
urine samples. The methylation status of the two genes was analyzed by
methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) in both urinary bladder cell
carcinoma samples and urine samples. Sensitivity and specificity values of the
method were assessed and compared with the results of the cytology test.
Methylation of TWIST1 and NID2 was detected in 98.2% and 96.4% of the tumor
samples, and in 87.5% and 95.8% of the urine samples, respectively. The
sensitivity of TWIST1 and NID2 genes (87.5% and 95.8% in urine samples,
respectively), was higher compared with urine cytology (62.5%) for cancer
detection. The sensitivity of any of the two genes was 88.8% (8/9) for low-grade 
cases. The sensitivity of urine cytology was 33.3% for the same low-grade cases. 
To be used in the early noninvasive diagnosis of bladder cancer, the combined
methylation analysis of TWIST1 and NID2 genes may be a simple, noninvasive,
sensitive, and specific method for detecting cancer cells in urine.

TWIST1 promoter methylation is associated with prognosis in tonsillar squamous
cell carcinoma.

Tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas (TSCC) frequently present with locally
advanced diseases and cervical metastases, which are associated with poor
prognoses. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is critical for tumor
invasiveness and metastatic potential. Recent studies have shown that
TWIST1-inducing EMT is overexpressed and hypermethylated in several cancers,
indicating disease progression. The aim of the present study was to determine the
clinical and prognostic significance of TWIST1 hypermethylation and EMT-related
protein expression in TSCC. Methylation levels of TWIST1 promoter were analyzed
by quantitative real-time methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction.
Immunohistochemical analyses of TWIST1, Snail, and SMAD nuclear interacting
protein-1 (SNIP1) were performed in 65 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks
of surgically resected specimens. TWIST1 promoter hypermethylation was found in
27.7% (18/65) of TSCCs. TWIST1 promoter hypermethylation was associated with poor
differentiation (P = .012). Contralateral cervical lymph node metastasis was more
frequently observed in TWIST1-methylated tumors (P = .029). High protein
expressions of TWIST1, Snail, and SNIP1 were observed in 14 TSCC specimens
(21.5%), 21 TSCC specimens (32.3%), and 38 TSCC specimens (58.5%), respectively. 
SNIP1 expression correlated significantly with TWIST1 methylation (P = .001),
whereas TWIST1 protein expression did not. Contralateral cervical lymph node
metastasis was an independent risk factor of the decreased overall survival rate 
(P = .002). TWIST1 methylation (P = .031) and pN stage (P = .037) were
independent factors of poor prognoses affecting disease-free survival. TWIST1
promoter hypermethylation may be a useful molecular marker for predicting
prognoses and contralateral cervical lymph node metastases in patients with TSCC.

Mesodermal and neural crest derived ovine tibial and mandibular osteoblasts
display distinct molecular differences.

Reichert JC(1), Gohlke J, Friis TE, Quent VM, Hutmacher DW.

(1)Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of
Technology, 60 Musk Ave, 4059 Kelvin Grove, Queensland, Australia.

Mandibular osteoblasts originate from the neural crest and deposit bone
intramembranously, mesoderm derived tibial osteoblasts by endochondral
mechanisms. Bone synthesized by both cell types is identical in structure, yet
functional differences between the two cell types may exist. Thus, both matched
juvenile and adult mandibular and tibial osteoblasts were studied regarding their
proliferative capacity, their osteogenic potential and the expression of
osteogenic and origin related marker genes. Juvenile tibial cells proliferated at
the highest rate while juvenile mandibular cells exhibited higher ALP activity
depositing more mineralized matrix. Expression of Hoxa4 in tibial cells verified 
their mesodermal origin, whereas very low levels in mandibular cells confirmed
their ectodermal descent. Distinct differences in the expression pattern of bone 
development related genes (collagen type I, osteonectin, osteocalcin, Runx2,
MSX1/2, TGF-ß1, BAMBI, TWIST1, ß-catenin) were found between the different cell
types. The distinct dissimilarities in proliferation, alkaline phosphatase
activity, the expression of characteristic genes, and mineralization may aid to
explain the differences in bone healing time observed in mandibular bone when
compared to long bones of the extremities.

Prognostic significance of twist and N-cadherin expression in NSCLC.

Hui L(1), Zhang S, Dong X, Tian D, Cui Z, Qiu X.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory Center, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University,
Shenyang, China.

BACKGROUND: Metastasis is the most common cause of disease failure and mortality 
for non-small cell lung cancer after surgical resection. Twist has been recently 
identified as a putative oncogene and a key regulator of carcinoma metastasis.
N-cadherin is associated with a more aggressive behavior of cell lines and
tumors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical relevance of Twist and
N-cadherin expression in NSCLC, and the effects of Twist1 knockdown on lung
cancer cells.
METHODS: We examined the expressions of Twist and N-cadherin by
immunohistochemistry in 120 cases of non-small cell lung cancer (including 68
cases with follow-up records). We also analyzed Twist1 and N-cadherin mRNA
expression in 30 non-small cell lung cancer tissues using quantitative reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction. The functional roles of Twist1 in lung
cancer cell lines were evaluated by small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of
the protein followed by analyses of cell apoptosis and invasion.
RESULTS: In lung cancer tissues, the overexpression rate of Twist was 38.3% in
lung cancer tissues. Overexpression of N-cadherin was shown in 40.83% of primary 
tumors. Moreover, Twist1 mRNA expression levels correlated with N-cadherin mRNA
levels. Furthermore, overexpression of Twist1 or N-cadherin in primary non-small 
cell lung cancers was associated with a shorter overall survival (P<0.01, P<0.01,
respectively). Depleting Twist expression inhibited cell invasion and increased
apoptosis in lung cancer cell lines.
CONCLUSIONS: The overexpression of Twist and N-cadherin could be considered as
useful biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of NSCLC. Twist1 could inhibit
apoptosis and promote the invasion of lung cancer cells, and depletion of Twist1 
in lung cancer cells led to inhibition of N-cadherin expression.

STAT3 mediates TGF-ß1-induced TWIST1 expression and prostate cancer invasion.

Cho KH(1), Jeong KJ, Shin SC, Kang J, Park CG, Lee HY.

Author information:

Medicine, Konyang University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.

TGF-ß1 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to stimulate cancer cell
progression, and TWIST1 is a critical regulator of EMT. In the present study, we 
determined the underlying mechanisms of TGF-ß1-induced TWIST1 expression and its 
effect on prostate cancer cell invasion. TGF-ß1 stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation 
and HIF-1a expression. Silencing either STAT3 or HIF-1a efficiently attenuated
TGF-ß1-induced TWIST1 expression. Further ectopic expression of a dominant
negative mutant of STAT3 reduced TGF-ß1-induced TWIST1 expression. In addition,
STAT3 and HIF-1a up-regulated TWIST1 expression by direct binding to a TWIST1
promoter. Strikingly, STAT3 also enhanced TGF-ß1-induced TWIST1 expression
through HIF-1a stabilization. Collectively, we demonstrate a mechanistic cascade 
of TGF-ß1 up-regulating STAT3 activation and HIF-1a stabilization and subsequent 
TWIST1 expression, leading to prostate cancer invasion.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of Twist and E-cadherin in ovarian
cancer tissues as well as the role of epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT)
in ovarian cancer metastasis.
METHOD: The expressions of Twist and E-cadherin in 54 cases of ovarian cancer and
paracancerous tissues were detected by Western blottin g and reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We used RNA interference to silence
Twist expression in human ovarian cancer cell line, and detected E-cadherin
expression using Western blotting.
RESULTS: There was an increase in the relative abundance of Twist proteins and a 
decrease in E-cadherin in ovarian cancer compared with normal ovary tissues (P < 
0.05). The expression levels of Twist and E-cadherin mRNA were 1.49 ± 0.53 and
0.82 ± 0.24 in ovarian cancer, and 1.14 ± 0.38 and 1.08 ± 0.19 in paracancerous
tissues, respectively. The difference between the indicators in ovarian cancer
and in paracancerous tissues was statistically significant (P < 0.05). When the
Twist expression was silenced in an ovarian cancer cell line, the expression of
the E-cadherin protein increased (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: The expression of Twist is upregulated, whereas that of E-cadherin is
downregulated in ovarian cancer. EMT, mediated by Twist, may be correlated with
ovarian cancer metastasis.

Expression of transcription factor Twist1 in bladder urothelial carcinoma and its
clinical significance.

Tang X(1), Xing J, Li W, Wu Z, Zhang K, Zheng J.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University,
Xiamen, China.

PURPOSE: Transcription factor Twist1 is known to play a vital role in cancer
development, progression and metastasis. However, regulation mechanisms beneath
Twist1 expression, as well as the correlation between its expression and bladder 
urothelial carcinoma (BUC), are still under investigation. Herein, we tried to
investigate the expression of Twist1 in BUC specimens and non-cancerous mucosas
and illustrate their relationships with clinicopathological features.
METHODS: The expression of Twist1 mRNA in 42 fresh BUC specimens and 13 paired
non-cancerous mucosas was detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RFQ-RTPCR). Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
was used to detect the expression of Twist1 protein in 40 paraffin embedded BUC
specimens and 14 paired non-cancerous mucosas, and their relationships with
clinicopathological features.
RESULTS: The expression levels of Twist1 mRNA in 13 paired BUC specimens were
significantly lower than the non-cancerous mucosas. The positive expression rate 
of Twist1 protein in BUC specimens (90.0%; 36/40) was significantly higher than
the non-cancerous mucosas (7.14%; 1/14). Twist1 protein was mainly distributed in
the nucleus, and expressed obviously in the mesenchymal cells of several
specimens (13.9%;5/36). However, expressions of Twist1 protein were not
associated with TNM stage and grade. It was also shown that the expression
tendency of Twist1 protein was distinct from Twist1 mRNA, and both were not
correlated with age, gender, and smoking history.
CONCLUSION: As a probable potential biomarker for BUC, Twist1 gene may play a
role as an oncogene during the tumorigenesis and development of BUC. Its abnormal
protein expression may be associated with disordered regulations after
transcription.

The pathobiology of the oncogenic tyrosine kinase NPM-ALK: a brief update.

Author information:

University of Alberta, Rm 2338, Cross Cancer Institute, 11560 University Avenue, 
Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 1Z2.

Extensive research has been carried out in the past two decades to study the
pathobiology of nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK), which is an
oncogenic fusion protein found exclusively in a specific type of T-cell lymphoid 
malignancy, namely ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Results from
these studies have provided highly useful insights into the mechanisms by which a
constitutively tyrosine kinase, such as NPM-ALK, promotes tumorigenesis. Several 
previous publications have comprehensively summarized the advances in this field.
In this review, we provide readers with a brief update on specific areas of
NPM-ALK pathobiology. In the first part, the NPM-ALK/signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling axis is discussed, with an
emphasis on the existence of multiple biochemical defects that have been shown to
amplify the oncogenic effects of this signaling axis. Specifically, findings
regarding JAK3, SHP1 and the stimulatory effects of several cytokines including
interleukin (IL)-9, IL-21 and IL-22 are summarized. New concepts stemming from
recent observations regarding the functional interactions among the NPM-ALK/STAT3
axis, ß catenin and glycogen synthase kinase 3ß will be postulated. Lastly, new
mechanisms by which the NPM-ALK/STAT3 axis promotes tumorigenesis, such as its
modulations of Twist1, hypoxia-induced factor 1a, CD274, will be described. In
the second part, we summarize recent data generated by mass spectrometry studies 
of NPM-ALK, and use MSH2 and heat shock proteins as examples to illustrate the
use of mass spectrometry data in stimulating new research in this field. In the
third part, the evolving field of microRNA in the context of NPM-ALK biology is
discussed.

Indole-3-carbinol and 3',3'-diindolylmethane modulate androgen's effect on C-C
chemokine ligand 2 and monocyte attraction to prostate cancer cells.

Kim EK(1), Kim YS, Milner JA, Wang TT.

Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, USA.

Inflammation has a role in prostate tumorigenesis. Recruitment of inflammatory
monocytes to the tumor site is mediated by C-C chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) through 
binding to its receptor CCR2. We hypothesized that androgen could modulate CCL2
expression in hormone-responsive prostate cancer cells and thereby promote
recruitment of monocytes. Given the inhibitory effect of broccoli-derived
compounds indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) on
androgen-dependent pathways, we also reasoned that I3C and DIM could modulate the
effect of androgen on CCL2-mediated pathways. Dihydrotestosterone was found to
induce a time-dependent (0-72 hours) and concentration-dependent (0-1 nmol/L)
increase in CCL2 mRNA levels in androgen-responsive human prostate cancer cells
(LNCaP). This increase in CCL2 mRNA corresponded with increased secretion of CCL2
protein. The effect of dihydrotestosterone was mediated through an androgen
receptor (AR)-dependent pathway as small inhibitor RNA against AR negated the
induction of CCL2. Although dihydrotestosterone also induced TWIST1 mRNA, an
epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related factor, and purported inducer of CCL2, 
blocking its expression with small inhibitor RNA did not inhibit
dihydrotestosterone induction of CCL2 mRNA. Moreover, conditioned media from
androgen-treated cells promoted human monocyte THP-1 cell migration and this
effect was blocked by antibody against CCL-2. Both I3C and DIM inhibited
promotional effects of dihydrotestosterone on CCL2 and migration. These results
show that androgen may regulate CCL2 and promote inflammatory microenvironment in
prostate tumors and that this process can be blocked by broccoli-derived
compounds.

Overexpression of the prometastatic chromatin modifier protein metastasis tumor
antigen 1 (MTA1) in human cancer contributes to tumor aggressiveness, but the
role of endogenous MTA1 in cancer has not been explored. Here, we report the
effects of selective genetic depletion of MTA1 in a physiologically relevant
spontaneous mouse model of breast cancer pulmonary metastasis. We found that MTA1
acts as a mandatory modifier of breast-to-lung metastasis without effects on
primary tumor formation. The underlying mechanism involved MTA1-dependent
stimulation of STAT3 transcription through action on the MTA1/STAT3/Pol II
coactivator complex, and, in turn, on the expression and functions of STAT3
target genes including Twist1. Accordingly, we documented a positive correlation 
between levels of MTA1 and STAT3 in publicly available breast cancer data sets.
Together, our findings reveal an essential modifying role of the physiologic
level of MTA1 in supporting pulmonary metastasis of breast cancer.

Differential expression of transcription factors Snail, Slug, SIP1, and Twist in 
ameloblastoma.

Siar CH(1), Ng KH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Oral Pathology, Oral Medicine and Periodontology, Faculty of
Dentistry, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

BACKGROUND: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via the mechanism of
transcription repression is a crucial process for the induction of invasiveness
in many human tumors. Ameloblastoma is a benign odontogenic epithelial neoplasm
with a locally infiltrative behavior. Twist, an EMT promoter, has been implicated
in its invasiveness. The roles of the other transcription factors remain
unclarified.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four transcription factors, namely Snail, Slug, SIP1, and 
Twist, were examined immunohistochemically in 64 ameloblastoma [18 unicystic
(UA), 20 solid/multicystic (SA), 4 desmoplastic (DA), and 22 recurrent (RA)].
RESULTS: All four transcription factors were differentially expressed in
ameloblastoma [Snail: n = 60/64 (94%); Slug: n = 21/64 (33%); SIP: n = 18/64
(28%); Twist: n = 26/64 (41%)] (P < 0.05). Their distribution patterns were
heterogeneous and were not significantly different between the tumor invasive
front and central area (P > 0.05). Intracellular protein localization was
predominantly nuclear for Snail, cytoplasmic>nuclear for Slug and SIP1, and
cytoplasmic/nuclear for Twist. Overexpression of Snail in most subsets (UA =
18/18; SMA = 19/20; DA = 4/4; RA = 19/22) compared with the other transcription
factors (P < 0.05) and selective expression for Slug, SIP1, and Twist in
squamous/keratinous foci and at sites of epithelial cystic degeneration were
among the main observations made. Stromal cells surrounding immunoreactive tumor 
cells tended to stain positive.
CONCLUSIONS: Present findings suggest that these transcription factors probably
play differential roles in mediating local invasiveness in ameloblastoma.
Overexpression of Snail in most subsets suggests that this molecule is most
likely the prototype transcription factor involved in inducing EMT in the
ameloblastoma.

BACKGROUND AND METHODS: In addition to possess cross drug resistance
characteristic, emerging evidences have shown that multiple-drug resistance (MDR)
cancer cells exhibit aberrant metastatic capacity when compared to parental
cells. In this study, we explored the contribution of c-Jun N-terminal kinases
(JNK) signaling to the mesenchymal phenotypes and the aberrant motile capacity of
MDR cells utilizing a well characterized MDR cell line KB/VCR, which is
established from KB human epidermoid carcinoma cells by vincristine (VCR), and
its parental cell line KB.
RESULTS: Taking advantage of experimental strategies including pharmacological
tool and gene knockdown, we showed here that interference with JNK signaling
pathway by targeting JNK1/2 or c-Jun reversed the mesenchymal properties of
KB/VCR cells to epithelial phenotypes and suppressed the motile capacity of
KB/VCR cells, such as migration and invasion. These observations support a
critical role of JNK signaling in maintaining the mesenchymal properties of
KB/VCR cells. Furthermore, we observed that JNK signaling may control the
expression of both snail and twist1 in KB/VCR cells, indicating that both snail
and twist1 are involved in controlling the mesenchymal characteristics of KB/VCR 
cells by JNK signaling.
CONCLUSION: JNK signaling is required for maintaining the mesenchymal phenotype
of KB/VCR cells; and JNK signaling may maintain the mesenchymal characteristics
of KB/VCR cells potentially through snail and twist1.

Twist1 controls a cell-specification switch governing cell fate decisions within 
the cardiac neural crest.

Neural crest cells are multipotent progenitor cells that can generate both
ectodermal cell types, such as neurons, and mesodermal cell types, such as smooth
muscle. The mechanisms controlling this cell fate choice are not known. The basic
Helix-loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factor Twist1 is expressed throughout the
migratory and post-migratory cardiac neural crest. Twist1 ablation or mutation of
the Twist-box causes differentiation of ectopic neuronal cells, which molecularly
resemble sympathetic ganglia, in the cardiac outflow tract. Twist1 interacts with
the pro-neural factor Sox10 via its Twist-box domain and binds to the Phox2b
promoter to repress transcriptional activity. Mesodermal cardiac neural crest
trans-differentiation into ectodermal sympathetic ganglia-like neurons is
dependent upon Phox2b function. Ectopic Twist1 expression in neural crest
precursors disrupts sympathetic neurogenesis. These data demonstrate that Twist1 
functions in post-migratory neural crest cells to repress pro-neural factors and 
thereby regulate cell fate determination between ectodermal and mesodermal
lineages.

Well-differentiated papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma are the most
frequent types of thyroid cancer and the prognosis is generally favorable
however, a number of patients develops recurrences. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate
(EGCG), a major catechin in green tea, was shown to possess remarkable
therapeutic potential against various types of human cancers, although data on
thyroid cancer cells are still lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate 
the effect of EGCG on the proliferation and motility of human thyroid papillary
(FB-2) and follicular (WRO) carcinoma cell lines. Our results demonstrate that
EGCG (10, 40, 60 µM) treatment inhibited the growth of FB-2 and WRO cells in a
dose-dependent manner. These changes were associated with reduced cyclin D1,
increased p21 and p53 expression. Furthermore, EGCG suppressed phosphorylation of
AKT and ERK1/2. In addition EGCG treatment results in reduction of cell motility 
and migration. Changes in motility and migration in FB-2 were associated with
modulation in the expression of several proteins involved in cell adhesion and
reorganization of actin cytoskeleton. After 24 h EGCG caused an increase of the
E-cadherin expression and a concomitant decrease of SNAIL, ZEB and the basic
helix-loop-helix transcription factor TWIST. Besides expression of Vimentin,
N-cadherin and a5-integrin was down-regulated. These data well correlate with a
reduction of MMP9 activity as evidenced by gelatin zymography. Our findings
support the inhibitory role of EGCG on thyroid cancer cell proliferation and
motility with concomitant loss of epithelial-to-mesenchymal cell transition
markers.

Membrane Type 1 Matrix Metalloproteinase induces an epithelial to mesenchymal
transition and cancer stem cell-like properties in SCC9 cells.

Medical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.

BACKGROUND: Tissue invasion and metastasis are acquired abilities of cancer and
related to the death in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Emerging
observations indicate that the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is
associated with tumor progression and the generation of cells with cancer stem
cells (CSCs) properties. Membrane Type 1 Matrix Metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is a 
cell surface proteinase, which is involved in degrading extracellular matrix
components that can promote tumor invasion and cell migration.
METHODS: In the current study, we utilized SCC9 cells stably transfected with an 
empty vector (SCC9-N) or a vector encoding human MT1-MMP (SCC9-M) to study the
role of MT1-MMP in EMT development.
RESULTS: Upon up-regulation of MT1-MMP, SCC9-M cells underwent EMT, in which they
presented a fibroblast-like phenotype and had a decreased expression of
epithelial markers (E-cadherin, cytokeratin18 and ß-catenin) and an increased
expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin and fibronectin). We further
demonstrated that MT1-MMP-induced morphologic changes increased the level of
Twist and ZEB, and were dependent on repressing the transcription of E-cadherin. 
These activities resulted in low adhesive, high invasive abilities of the SCC9-M 
cells. Furthermore, MT1-MMP-induced transformed cells exhibited cancer stem cell 
(CSC)-like characteristics, such as low proliferation, self-renewal ability,
resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and apoptosis, and expression of CSCs
surface markers.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our study indicates that overexpression of MT1-MMP
induces EMT and results in the acquisition of CSC-like properties in SCC9 cells. 
Our growing understanding of the mechanism regulating EMT may provide new targets
against invasion and metastasis in OSCC.

The Wnt signalling pathway is upregulated in an in vitro model of acquired
tamoxifen resistant breast cancer.

Clinical School, University of New South Wales, New South Wales 2052, Australia.

BACKGROUND: Acquired resistance to Tamoxifen remains a critical problem in breast
cancer patient treatment, yet the underlying causes of resistance have not been
fully elucidated. Abberations in the Wnt signalling pathway have been linked to
many human cancers, including breast cancer, and appear to be associated with
more metastatic and aggressive types of cancer. Here, our aim was to investigate 
if this key pathway was involved in acquired Tamoxifen resistance, and could be
targeted therapeutically.
METHODS: An in vitro model of acquired Tamoxifen resistance (named TamR) was
generated by growing the estrogen receptor alpha (ER) positive MCF7 breast cancer
cell line in increasing concentrations of Tamoxifen (up to 5 uM). Alterations in 
the Wnt signalling pathway and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in
response to Tamoxifen and treatment with the Wnt inhibitor, IWP-2 were measured
via quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) and TOP/FOP Wnt reporter assays. Resistance to
Tamoxifen, and effects of IWP-2 treatment were determined by MTT proliferation
assays.
RESULTS: TamR cells exhibited increased Wnt signalling as measured via the
TOP/FOP Wnt luciferase reporter assays. Genes associated with both the ß-catenin 
dependent (AXIN2, MYC, CSNK1A1) and independent arms (ROR2, JUN), as well as
general Wnt secretion (PORCN) of the Wnt signalling pathway were upregulated in
the TamR cells compared to the parental MCF7 cell line. Treatment of the TamR
cell line with human recombinant Wnt3a (rWnt3a) further increased the resistance 
of both MCF7 and TamR cells to the anti-proliferative effects of Tamoxifen
treatment. TamR cells demonstrated increased expression of EMT markers (VIM,
TWIST1, SNAI2) and decreased CDH1, which may contribute to their resistance to
Tamoxifen. Treatment with the Wnt inhibitor, IWP-2 inhibited cell proliferation
and markers of EMT.
CONCLUSIONS: These data support the role of the Wnt signalling pathway in
acquired resistance to Tamoxifen. Further research into the mechanism by which
activated Wnt signalling inhibits the effects of Tamoxifen should be undertaken. 
As a number of small molecules targeting the Wnt pathway are currently in
pre-clinical development, combinatorial treatment with endocrine agents and Wnt
pathway inhibitors may be a useful therapeutic option in the future for a subset 
of breast cancer patients.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 attenuates the metastasis of non-small cell lung 
cancer through inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key enzyme of the renin-angiotensin
system (RAS). ACE2 plays a critical counterbalancing role by degrading
angiotensin II (Ang II) to Ang 1-7. Recent studies suggest that RAS influences
tumor growth and development by its paracrine effects on the tumor
microenvironment. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is now thought to be a 
process that plays a fundamental role in tumor progression and metastasis. In the
present study, we investigated the role of ACE2 in lung cancer metastasis and the
mechanism of EMT. This is the first study to elucidate the mechanism through
which the overexpression of ACE2 in the A549 lung cancer cell line decreases
metastasis formation in vivo and upregulates the expression of E-cadherin both
in vitro and in vivo. We also observed the downregulation of vimentin, which
supports a role of ACE2 in influencing EMT in lung cancer. Further analysis
indicated that ACE2 abrogated the upregulation of TGF-ß1-induced EMT markers,
such as vimentin and a-smooth muscle actin (aSMA) in vitro in A549 cells.
Finally, exposing A549 cells stably expressing ACE2 to DX600, an inhibitor of
ACE2, recovered the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to TGF-ß1-mediated induction
of EMT. Our study demonstrated that ACE2 attenuated the metastasis of lung cancer
and may serve as a target for new strategies to inhibit EMT in cancer cells.

Cancer stem cells play an important role in carcinogenesis and resistance to
treatment and may lead to metastasis. The isolation of circulating stem cells
involves cell sorting based on the presence of cell surface markers. Many surface
markers such as CD133, c-Kit, SOX, OCT4 and TWIST have been reported. In the
present study, we determined the expression of different stem cell markers and
their variation in expression at different stages of the treatment process.
Samples of EDTA blood were collected from metastatic colorectal cancer patients, 
and circulating cancer stem cells were isolated for the analysis of the
expression of stem cell markers using RT-PCR. These findings were correlated with
the response to therapy. All statistical analyses were performed using the
GraphPad Prism 5.03 software. Significant differences were found in the
expression levels of the markers CD133, SOX2, OCT4 and TWIST1. No differences
were found in c-Kit expression. Correlation in the expression levels of most of
the markers was observed. Expression of CD133, OCT4, SOX2 and TWIST1 had a
predictive value for colon cancer behavior. Evaluation of this stem cell gene
expression panel may be useful for predicting the response during the process of 
treatment, and the relative easy access to samples facilitates this method.
Moreover the correlation between CD133 and TWIST1 expression may be associated
with tumor regrowth and metastatic relapse.

Sarcomatoid carcinoma represents a complete phenotype with various pathways of
epithelial mesenchymal transition.

Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

AIMS: Sarcomatoid carcinoma (SC) is considered to be a result of the sarcomatoid 
change of epithelial carcinoma. However, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 
in SC has been insufficiently studied.
METHODS: We evaluated the expression patterns of EMT-related phenotypic markers
with transcription factors in 27 SCs originating from various organs, and we
investigated the phenotypic characteristics of SCs classified as complete,
incomplete or wild-type. We further analysed correlations between EMT-related
phenotype markers and transcription factors.
RESULTS: Epithelial markers (E-cadherin, claudin-3 and claudin-4) were
consistently down-regulated, whereas mesenchymal markers (S100A4, a-smooth muscle
actin (SMA), vimentin, PDGFRa and ß-catenin) were variously expressed except for 
vimentin. EMT-related transcription factors (SIP1, Snail1, Slug, Twist1, ZEP1 and
Oct-4) also showed various expression patterns. The expression patterns of
phenotypic markers showed that most SCs (22/27, 81.5%, 95% CI 65.8 to 97.1%) had 
complete EMT phenotypes, whereas the remaining 5 (18.5%, 95% CI 2.8 to 24.1%)
were of incomplete type. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis revealed
that SCs were clustered into several subgroups by EMT-related protein expression 
pattern. Twist1 positivity was significantly concordant with a-SMA positivity (<U+03BA> 
value: 0.908; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.00, p<0.001, adjusted p<0.001). The EMT phenotypes
of SC were simple, with complete phenotype being the predominant form, and the
morphological changes of the SCs were also relevant in terms of EMT.
CONCLUSIONS: SC seems to be an irreversible, permanent change in the EMT
phenomenon, with complete EMT phenotypes and various EMT-related pathways being
involved in SC.

Interhelical loops within the bHLH domain are determinant in maintaining
TWIST1-DNA complexes.

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor TWIST1 is essential to
embryonic development, and hijacking of its function contributes to the
development of numerous cancer types. It forms either a homodimer or a
heterodimeric complex with an E2A or HAND partner. These functionally distinct
complexes display sometimes antagonistic functions during development, so that
alterations in the balance between them lead to pronounced morphological
alterations, as observed in mice and in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome patients. We,
here, describe the structures of TWIST1 bHLH-DNA complexes produced in silico
through molecular dynamics simulations. We highlight the determinant role of the 
interhelical loops in maintaining the TWIST1-DNA complex structures and provide a
structural explanation for the loss of function associated with several TWIST1
mutations/insertions observed in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome patients. An animated
interactive 3D complement (I3DC) is available in Proteopedia at

cancer.

BACKGROUND: It is widely accepted that the adenoma-carcinoma sequence represents 
the process by which most colorectal cancers (CRCs) arise. Although gankyrin is
overexpressed in CRC tissues, its roles in the initiation step of colorectal
carcinogenesis remain largely unexplored.
AIM: We investigated the expression of gankyrin and stemness factors in human
colorectal adenomas, precancerous lesions, as well as CRC tissues to assess its
involvement in colorectal carcinogenesis.
METHODS: Expression of several molecules including gankyrin and certain stemness 
factors was compared in 50 pairs of adenoma and surrounding normal mucosa using
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and in 30 CRC tissues using
immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: In CRC specimens, expression of CD133, a cancer stem cell marker, was
significantly correlated with gankyrin expression. Gankyrin knockdown decreased
the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and stemness factors 
such as Nanog and Oct-4 in colorectal cancer cells. Expression of gankyrin and
these stemness factors was significantly higher in adenomas than in the
surrounding normal mucosa. Importantly, a significant correlation was observed
between the expression of gankyrin, VEGF, and Nanog in colorectal adenomas.
CONCLUSION: In CRC development, gankyrin would control stem cell behavior by
regulating the expression of stemness factors.

Pterostilbene, a bioactive component of blueberries, suppresses the generation of
breast cancer stem cells within tumor microenvironment and metastasis via
modulating NF-<U+03BA>B/microRNA 448 circuit.

SCOPE: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been shown to promote metastasis 
and malignancy. Pterostilbene, a natural stilbene isolated from blueberries, has 
been suggested for anti-cancer effects. Here, we explored the potential cancer
stem cells (CSCs)/TAM modulating effects of pterostilbene in breast cancer.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using flowcytometric and Boyden chamber assay, we showed
MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells cocultured with M2 TAMs exhibited increased percentage 
of CD44(+) /CD24(-) CSC population and migratory/invasive abilities. RT-PCR
results showed that CD44(+) /CD24(-) cells expressed an increased level of
HIF-1a, ß-catenin, Twist1, and NF-<U+03BA>B and enhanced tumor sphere forming ability.
Additionally, pterostilbene treatment dose dependently overcame M2 TAM-induced
enrichment of CSCs and metastatic potential of breast cancer cells.
Mechanistically, pterostilbene suppressed NF<U+03BA>B, Twist1, vimentin, and increased
E-cadherin expression. Using siRNA technique, we demonstrated that
pterostilbene-mediated NF<U+03BA>B downregulation was correlated to an increased amount 
of microRNA 448. Finally, pterostilbene-mediated suppression in tumorigenesis and
metastasis was validated by noninvasive bioluminescence in mice bearing M2 TAM
cocultured MDA-MB-231 tumor.
CONCLUSION: Pterostilbene effectively suppresses the generation of CSCs and
metastatic potential under the influence of M2 TAMs via modulating EMT associated
signaling pathways, specifically NF-<U+03BA>B/miR488 circuit. Thus, pterostilbene could 
be an ideal anti-CSC agent in clinical settings.

expression in gastric cancer.

University, Harbin 150040, China.

It was previously reported that an antitumor polysaccharide (PGPW1) was isolated 
from the root of Panax ginseng. To extend our study, we investigated here the
anti-invasive and metastatic effects of PGPW1 on human gastric cancer cell line
HGC-27 and tried to determine its possible mechanism of action. Both scratch
wound-healing and Transwell assay identified that PGPW1 dose-dependently
inhibited migration and invasiveness of HGC-27 cells. Furthermore, results of
western blot showed that protein levels of Twist and AKR1C2 were inhibited by
PGPW1, whereas an increase of NF1 was observed. Moreover, down-regulation of
Twist expression by PGPW1 blocked epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),
characterized by a gain of epithelial cell markers, E-cadherin, and loss of the
mesenchymal markers, vimentin and N-cadherin, at protein levels. Collectively, we
confirmed that PGPW1 decreased migration and invasion of HGC-27 cells by
regulation of Twist, AKR1C2, NF1, E-cadherin, vimentin and N-cadherin expression.
In conclusion, PGPW1 may serve as a powerful chemopreventive agent against
gastric cancer metastasis.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an essential step for cancer
metastasis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate
target-mRNAs post-transcriptionally. The expression and function of miRNAs in EMT
of HT-29 colonic cells remain elusive. This study looks at expression of miRNAs
in EMT and explores the effects of miRNAs on EMT in HT-29 cell line. HT-29 was
treated with TGF ß to establish an EMT model, in which a collection of miRNAs was
dynamically regulated by real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis. Among them, miR-21 and
miR-27 were significantly upregulated, while miR-22, miR-26, miR-30, miR-181,
miR-200b, miR-200c and miR-214 were markedly downregulated. MiRNA-inhibitors were
used to knockdown miRNAs in HT-29 and EMT markers were determined by qPCR to
monitor the effects of miRNAs on EMT process. Results showed that miR-22 could
not alter the expression of EMT markers, while knockdown of miR-200b could
significantly increase that of epithelial markers, N-cadherin, Vimentin, a-Sma
and Twist1 and decrease that of mesenchymal marker, E-cadherin. Bioinformatic
analysis and Western blot showed that ZEB1 was directly suppressed by miR-200b.
In conclusion, miRNAs are dynamically regulated in TGF ß-induced EMT of HT-29 and
miR-200b was essential for EMT by suppressing the expression of ZEB1 in HT-29.

Neuroblastoma arises from sympathoadrenal progenitors of the neural crest and
expression of the neurotrophin receptor TrkB and its ligand, brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), is correlated with poor prognosis. Although activated
TrkB signaling promotes a more aggressive phenotype in established neuroblastoma 
cell lines, whether TrkB signaling is sufficient to transform neural
crest-derived cells has not been investigated. To address the role of TrkB
signaling in malignant transformation, we removed two immunoglobulin-like domains
from the extracellular domain of the full-length rat TrkB receptor to create a
<U+0394>IgTrkB that is constitutively active. In the pheochromocytoma-derived cell line 
PC12, <U+0394>IgTrkB promotes differentiation by stimulating process outgrowth; however,
in the rat neural crest-derived cell line NCM-1, <U+0394>IgTrkB signaling produces a
markedly transformed phenotype characterized by increased proliferation,
anchorage-independent cell growth, anoikis resistance and matrix invasion.
Furthermore, expression of <U+0394>IgTrkB leads to the upregulation of many transcripts 
encoding cancer-associated genes including cyclind1, twist1 and hgf, as well as
downregulation of tumor suppressors such as pten and rb1. In addition, <U+0394>IgTrkB
NCM-1 cells show a 21-fold increase in mRNA for MYCN, the most common genetic
marker for a poor prognosis in neuroblastoma. When injected into NOD SCID mice,
control GFP NCM-1 cells fail to grow whereas <U+0394>IgTrkB NCM-1 cells form rapidly
growing and invasive tumors necessitating euthanasia of all mice by 15 days post 
injection. In summary, these results indicate that activated TrkB signaling is
sufficient to promote the formation of a highly malignant phenotype in neural
crest-derived cells.

Repression of bone morphogenetic protein 4 by let-7i attenuates mesenchymal
migration of head and neck cancer cells.

The movement modes of epithelial cancer cells in three-dimensional (3D)
environments include the mesenchymal mode, which is associated with local
invasion, and the amoeboid mode, which facilitates distant metastasis. The
migratory behavior of individual cancer cells is critical for tumor
dissemination; however, the mechanism underlying regulation of the switch between
movement modes is not clearly understood. For head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC), local invasion is the major route of dissemination. We
previously demonstrated that, in HNSCC cells, Twist1 represses let-7i expression 
to elicit mesenchymal-mode movement through activation of Ras-related C3
botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1). In this study, we discover another important 
target gene of let-7i for regulating HNSCC migration. Using bioinformatic tools, 
we identified bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) as a candidate target of
let-7i. Further experiments, including 3'-untranslated region (UTR) reporter
assays, quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting, confirmed that BMP4 is a bona
fide target repressed by let-7i. In the HNSCC cell line OECM-1, knockdown of BMP4
reduced mesenchymal-mode migration and invasion in 3D culture. In clinical HNSCC 
samples, let-7i expression was inversely correlated with BMP4 expression. Our
results revealed that let-7i attenuates mesenchymal-mode migration of HNSCC cells
through repression of a novel target, BMP4.

Kinetic modeling-based detection of genetic signatures that provide
chemoresistance via the E2F1-p73/DNp73-miR-205 network.

Drug resistance is a major cause of deaths from cancer. E2F1 is a transcription
factor involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis. and metastasis through an
intricate regulatory network, which includes other transcription factors like p73
and cancer-related microRNAs like miR-205. To investigate the emergence of drug
resistance, we developed a methodology that integrates experimental data with a
network biology and kinetic modeling. Using a regulatory map developed to
summarize knowledge on E2F1 and its interplay with p73/DNp73 and miR-205 in
cancer drug responses, we derived a kinetic model that represents the network
response to certain genotoxic and cytostatic anticancer drugs. By perturbing the 
model parameters, we simulated heterogeneous cell configurations referred to as
in silico cell lines. These were used to detect genetic signatures characteristic
for single or double drug resistance. We identified a signature composed of high 
E2F1 and low miR-205 expression that promotes resistance to genotoxic drugs. In
this signature, downregulation of miR-205, can be mediated by an imbalance in the
p73/DNp73 ratio or by dysregulation of other cancer-related regulators of miR-205
expression such as TGFß-1 or TWIST1. In addition, we found that a genetic
signature composed of high E2F1, low miR-205, and high ERBB3 can render tumor
cells insensitive to both cytostatic and genotoxic drugs. Our model simulations
also suggested that conventional genotoxic drug treatment favors selection of
chemoresistant cells in genetically heterogeneous tumors, in a manner requiring
dysregulation of incoherent feedforward loops that involve E2F1, p73/DNp73, and
miR-205.

Analysis of Snail1 function and regulation by Twist1 in palatal fusion.

Diagnosis, Texas A&M University, Baylor College of Dentistry Dallas, TX, USA.

Palatal fusion is a tightly controlled process which comprises multiple cellular 
events, including cell movement and differentiation. Midline epithelial seam
(MES) degradation is essential to palatal fusion. In this study, we analyzed the 
function of Snail1 during the degradation of the MES. We also analyzed the
mechanism regulating the expression of the Snail1 gene in palatal shelves.
Palatal explants treated with Snail1 siRNA did not degrade the MES and E-cadherin
was not repressed leading to failure of palatal fusion. Transforming growth
factor beta 3 (Tgfß3) regulated Snail1 mRNA, as Snail1 expression decreased in
response to Tgfß3 neutralizing antibody and a PI-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor.
Twist1, in collaboration with E2A factors, regulated the expression of Snail1.
Twist1/E47 dimers bond to the Snail1 promoter to activate expression. Without
E47, Twist1 repressed Snail1 expression. These results support the hypothesis
that Tgfß3 may signal through Twist1 and then Snail1 to downregulate E-cadherin
expression during palatal fusion.

The aim of our study was to assess the nature and importance of claudin
expression in grade I-III ependymomas. The expression of claudins 2-5, 7, 10,
TWIST, and ZEB1 were investigated in a series of 61 ependymomas using
immunohistochemistry. All the claudins were expressed in ependymomas, except for 
CLDN4. CLDN5 positive tumours were associated with higher grade (p=0.049),
whereas CLDN10 was lower in higher grade tumours (p=0.039). CLDN5 and CLDN3 were 
overexpressed in ependymomas of cerebral location (p=0.036, p=0.007,
respectively). CLDN5 positive tumours showed more nuclear atypia, endothelial
proliferation, mitosis, and hypercellularity (p=0.007, p=0.018, p=0.041, p=0.010,
respectively). CLDN5 positivity correlated to higher proliferation (p=0.015).
CLDN7 was more often positive in primary tumours (p=0.041). Positive ZEB1
expression was associated with CLDN2 negativity (p=0.031). TWIST-negative tumours
were more often also CLDN5 and 10 negative (p=0.013, p=0.017, respectively).
CLDN5 was related to more aggressive tumours compared to CLDN2 and 10, which
tended to display a better degree of differentiation and a better prognosis.
CLDN2 and CLDN5 were expressed commonly in ependymomas, while the parental
ependymal cells in the central nervous system were usually negative. Evidently,
claudins influence growth and differentiation in ependymomas.

Invadopodia-associated proteins blockade as a novel mechanism for 6-shogaol and
pterostilbene to reduce breast cancer cell motility and invasion.

Hong BH(1), Wu CH, Yeh CT, Yen GC.

(1)Department of Food Science and Biotechnology, National Chung Hsing University,
Taichung, Taiwan.

SCOPE: Invadopodia are actin-rich membrane protrusions of tumor cells that are
thought to initiate the local migration and invasion during cancer metastasis.
The blockade of invadopodia-associated proteins has been reported as a promising 
approach for prevention of tumor metastasis. The aim of this study was to
investigate the modulatory effects of 6-shogaol and pterostilbene on invadopodia 
in aggressive breast cancer cells.
METHODS AND RESULTS: By wound-healing, transwell, and gelatin zymography assays, 
we found that 6-shogaol and pterostilbene effectively attenuated the motility and
invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, and suppressed the activities of matrix
metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Further
investigation into the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that the levels
of key modulators of invadopodium maturation, including c-Src kinase, cortactin, 
and membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) decreased when cells were 
treated with 6-shogaol or pterostilbene.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the repression of these factors might affect 
the maturation of invadopodia, inhibiting the metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells. In 
conclusion, the present study demonstrates for the first time that 6-shogaol and 
pterostilbene can inhibit invadopodium formation and MMP activity in highly
invasive breast cancer cells. We suggest that these compounds may be clinically
useful in chemopreventive treatments for metastatic breast cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression and possible roles of Twist1 and
Y-box-binding protein-1 (YB-1) in bladder cancer tissue. Twist1 belongs to the
family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors. A functional link between
Twist1 and YB-1 has recently been determined to play an important role in bladder
cancer cell lines.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Frozen samples from 75 patients with bladder cancer were
analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues from 53 patients with bladder cancer
were examined by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Twist1 transcript levels were positively correlated with YB-1 transcript
levels (coefficient of correlation = 0.42, P<0.001), tumor grade (low grade vs.
high grade; P<0.001), invasiveness (non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer vs. muscle
invasive bladder cancer; P = 0.0018), and metastasis (meta- vs. meta+; P<0.001). 
YB-1 transcript level was also correlated with grade (P = 0.029) and invasiveness
(P = 0.006). By immunohistochemistry, Twist1 expression was also correlated with 
YB-1 expression (P<0.001). Further, both Twist1 and YB-1 expression were
positively correlated with invasiveness (P = 0.007 and P = 0.002, respectively). 
Patients with high Twist1 expression and high YB-1 expression had lower overall
survival rates, compared with patients with low expression (log-rank test, P =
0.040 and P<0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a functional link between Twist1 and YB-1, and
they indicate that Twist1 and YB-1 promote bladder cancer progression.

High throughput transcriptome profiling of lithium stimulated human mesenchymal
stem cells reveals priming towards osteoblastic lineage.

Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) present in the bone marrow are the
precursors of osteoblasts, chondrocytes and adipocytes, and hold tremendous
potential for osteoregenerative therapy. However, achieving directed
differentiation into osteoblasts has been a major concern. The use of lithium for
enhancing osteogenic differentiation has been documented in animal models but its
effect in humans is not clear. We, therefore, performed high throughput
transcriptome analysis of lithium-treated hMSCs to identify altered gene
expression and its relevance to osteogenic differentiation. Our results show
suppression of proliferation and enhancement of alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
activity upon lithium treatment of hMSCs under non-osteogenic conditions.
Microarray profiling of lithium-stimulated hMSC revealed decreased expression of 
adipogenic genes (CEBPA, CMKLR1, HSD11B1) and genes involved in lipid
biosynthesis. Interestingly, osteoclastogenic factors and immune responsive genes
(IL7, IL8, CXCL1, CXCL12, CCL20) were also downregulated. Negative
transcriptional regulators of the osteogenic program (TWIST1 and PBX1) were
suppressed while genes involved in mineralization like CLEC3B and ATF4 were
induced. Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment of upregulated genes related 
to mesenchymal cell differentiation and signal transduction. Lithium priming led 
to enhanced collagen 1 synthesis and osteogenic induction of lithium pretreated
MSCs resulted in enhanced expression of Runx2, ALP and bone sialoprotein.
However, siRNA-mediated knockdown of RRAD, CLEC3B and ATF4 attenuated
lithium-induced osteogenic priming, identifying a role for RRAD, a member of
small GTP binding protein family, in osteoblast differentiation. In conclusion,
our data highlight the transcriptome reprogramming potential of lithium resulting
in higher propensity of lithium "primed" MSCs for osteoblastic differentiation.

Downregulated microRNA-200a promotes EMT and tumor growth through the
wnt/ß-catenin pathway by targeting the E-cadherin repressors ZEB1/ZEB2 in gastric
adenocarcinoma.

In a previous study, we found that microRNA (miRNA)-200a suppresses Wnt/ß-catenin
signaling by interacting with ß-catenin, thereby inhibiting migration, invasion
and proliferation. However, the mechanism involved in this suppression remains
unclear. In the present study, we investigated the underlying mechanism of
miR-200a regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in gastric
carcinoma cells, and confirmed the tumor suppressor role of miR-200a in vivo. The
expressions of miRNA-200a, -200b and -200c, identified by fluorescent in situ
hybridization, were downregulated and inversely correlated with WHO grades of
gastric adenocarcinoma (GA). The expression of the potential miR-200a target
genes ZEB1 and ZEB2 was detected immunohistochemically. These examinations used
the same tissue microarrays to analyze the relationships between miR-200a and
potential target genes. The expression of miR-200a and ZEB1/ZEB2 in the same GA
tissue microarrays was inversely related. Restored miR-200a expression inhibited 
tumor growth in nude mice harboring subcutaneous SGC7901 xenografts. The
expression of N-cadherin, ß-catenin, Twist1 and Snail2 decreased, and E-cadherin 
levels increased, when miR-200a was elevated, as tested by fluorescence
microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Similar results were observed in vivo. We
found upregulated miR-200a expression to increase E-cadherin and suppress the
Wnt/ß-catenin pathway by targeting ZEB1 and ZEB2 in GA, thus delaying tumor
growth in vivo. The effect of miR-200a on Wnt/ß-catenin signaling may provide a
therapeutic target against EMT.

This study investigates relationships between EMT and bone invasion by OSCC.
Three OSCC cell lines, SCC25, HN5, and Tca8113 were artificially induced to
display EMT by adding 5 ng/mL of TGF-ß1 to culture media for 1-3 days. Cell
morphology and phenotypic changes was examined by immunocytochemical staining of 
CK and VIM. EMT markers, cell-invasion factors, and osteoclast-related molecules 
were analysed at mRNA, gelatine and protein levels by real-time PCR, gelatine
zymography and Western blotting respectively. Mature osteoclasts differentiated
from Raw264.7 cells were treated by conditioned medium (CM) of OSCC cells
with/without TGF-ß1. Immunohistochemistry was performed to validate proteins of
CK, VIM, E-cad and Snail1 in OSCC tissue samples with bone invasion. Results
showed minimal staining of VIM was found in SCC25 and HN5, while Tca8113 cells
stained strongly. EMT markers Twist1 and N-cad were up-regulated; Snail1 and
E-cad down-regulated in all cells. Of factors associated with invasion, MMP-2 was
unchanged and MMP-9 increased in SCC25 and Tca8113, while MMP-2 was increased and
MMP-9 unchanged in HN5. For osteoclast-related molecules, both MT1-MMP and RANKL 
were up-regulated, while OPG was down-regulated in all cells. CM of OSCC cells
pre-treated with TGF-ß1 showed to prolong survival of osteoclasts up to 4 days.
All target molecules were validated in OSCC samples of bone invasion. These
findings suggest that TGF-ß1 not only induces EMT to increase the capacity of
OSCC for invasion, but also promotes factors which prolong osteoclast survival.
TGF-ß1 may enhance the ability of MMP2/9 in resorbing bone and favouring invasion
of cancer cells.

TWIST1, A novel androgen-regulated gene, is a target for NKX3-1 in prostate
cancer cells.

Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway. turid.eide@ous-hf.no.

BACKGROUND: TWIST1 plays a key role in EMT-mediated tumor invasion and
metastasis. Since bone metastasis is a hallmark of advanced prostate cancer and
is detected in at least 85% of patients who die of this disease, it is of great
importance to understand the regulation of the cellular signaling pathways
involved in the metastatic process.
METHODS: Prostatic cell lines were analyzed using real time RT-PCR, chromatin
immunoprecipitations (ChIP) and transfection of siRNA's and reporter constructs.
RESULTS: We report in this paper that TWIST1 is an androgen-regulated gene under 
tight regulation of NKX3-1. Androgens repress the expression of TWIST1 via
NKX3-1, which is a prostate-specific tumor suppressor that is down-regulated in
the majority of metastatic prostate tumors. We show that NKX3-1 binds to the
TWIST1 promoter and that NKX3-1 over-expression reduces the activity of a TWIST1 
promoter reporter construct, whereas NKX3-1 siRNA up-regulates endogenous TWIST1 
mRNA in prostate cancer cells.
CONCLUSION: Our finding that NKX3-1 represses TWIST1 expression emphasizes the
functional importance of NKX3-1 in regulating TWIST1 expression during prostate
cancer progression to metastatic disease.

Preaxial polydactyly (PPD) is a common congenital abnormality and its
classification varies among geneticists and hand surgeons. For example, the
triphalangeal thumb, preaxial polysyndactyly, and the mirror hand deformity are
considered as forms of PPD only in the genetics literature. Preaxial polydactyly 
is an error in the anteroposterior axis of the development of the upper limb. In 
this paper, the development of this axis is detailed and all molecular events
that are known to lead to PPD are reviewed. Finally, based on the review, PPD is 
viewed as a spectrum of severity of embryonic events.

Inhibition of TWIST1 leads to activation of oncogene-induced senescence in
oncogene-driven non-small cell lung cancer.

A large fraction of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are dependent on defined 
oncogenic driver mutations. Although targeted agents exist for EGFR- and
EML4-ALK-driven NSCLCs, no therapies target the most frequently found driver
mutation, KRAS. Furthermore, acquired resistance to the currently targetable
driver mutations is nearly universally observed. Clearly a novel therapeutic
approach is needed to target oncogene-driven NSCLCs. We recently showed that the 
basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist1 cooperates with mutant Kras to
induce lung adenocarcinoma in transgenic mouse models and that inhibition of
Twist1 in these models led to Kras-induced senescence. In the current study, we
examine the role of TWIST1 in oncogene-driven human NSCLCs. Silencing of TWIST1
in KRAS-mutant human NSCLC cell lines resulted in dramatic growth inhibition and 
either activation of a latent oncogene-induced senescence program or, in some
cases, apoptosis. Similar effects were observed in EGFR mutation-driven and
c-Met-amplified NSCLC cell lines. Growth inhibition by silencing of TWIST1 was
independent of p53 or p16 mutational status and did not require previously
defined mediators of senescence, p21 and p27, nor could this phenotype be rescued
by overexpression of SKP2. In xenograft models, silencing of TWIST1 resulted in
significant growth inhibition of KRAS-mutant, EGFR-mutant, and c-Met-amplified
NSCLCs. Remarkably, inducible silencing of TWIST1 resulted in significant growth 
inhibition of established KRAS-mutant tumors. Together these findings suggest
that silencing of TWIST1 in oncogene driver-dependent NSCLCs represents a novel
and promising therapeutic strategy.

TWIST1 regulates the activity of ubiquitin proteasome system via the miR-199/214 
cluster in human end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy.

BACKGROUND: The transcription factor TWIST1 has been described to regulate the
microRNA (miR)-199/214 cluster. Genetic disruption of TWIST1 resulted in a
cachectic phenotype and early death of the knock-out mice. This might be
connected to the activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome-system (UPS), as miR-199a
has been suggested to regulate the ubiquitin E2 ligases Ube2i and Ube2g1.
METHODS: Cardiac tissue from explanted hearts of 42 patients with dilated
cardiomyopathy and 20 healthy donor hearts were analysed for protein expression
of TWIST1 and its inhibitors Id-1, MuRF-1 and MAFbx, the expression of miR-199a, 
-199b and -214, as well as the activity of the UPS by using specific fluorogenic 
substrates.
RESULTS: TWIST1 was repressed in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy by 43%
(p=0.003), while Id1 expression was unchanged. This was paralleled by a reduced
expression of miR-199a by 38 ± 9% (p=0.053), miR-199b by 36 ± 13% (p=0.019) and
miR-214 by 41 ± 11% (p=0.0158) compared to donor hearts. An increased
peptidylglutamyl-peptide-hydrolysing activity (p<0.0001) was observed in the UPS,
while the chymotrypsin-like and trypsin-like activities were unchanged. The
protein levels of the rate limiting ubiquitin E3-ligases MuRF-1 and MAFbx were
up-regulated (p=0.005 and p=0.0156, respectively). Mechanistically silencing of
TWIST1 using siRNA in primary rat cardiomyocytes led to a down-regulation of the 
miR-199/214 cluster and to a subsequent up-regulation of Ube2i.
CONCLUSION: The TWIST1/miR-199/214 axis is down-regulated in dilated
cardiomyopathy, which is likely to play a role in the increased activity of the
UPS. This may contribute to the loss of cardiac mass during dilatation of the
heart.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a complex disease characterized by vascular
alterations, activation of the immune system and tissue fibrosis. Previous
studies have implicated activation of the interferon pathways in the pathogenesis
of SSc. The goal of this study was to determine whether interferon type I and/or 
type II could play a pathogenic role in SSc vasculopathy. Human dermal
microvascular endothelial cells (HDMVECs) and fibroblasts were obtained from
foreskins of healthy newborns. The RT Profiler PCR Array System was utilized to
screen for EndoMT genes. Treatment with IFN-a or IFN-<U+03B3> downregulated Fli1 and
VE-cadherin. In contrast, IFN-a and IFN-<U+03B3> exerted opposite effects on the
expression of a-SMA, CTGF, ET-1, and TGFß2, with IFN-a downregulating and IFN-<U+03B3>
upregulating this set of genes. Blockade of TGFß signaling normalized
IFN-<U+03B3>-mediated changes in Fli1, VE-cadherin, CTGF, and ET-1 levels, whereas
upregulation of a-SMA and TGFß2 was not affected. Bosentan treatment was more
effective than TGFß blockade in reversing the actions of IFN-<U+03B3>, including
downregulation of a-SMA and TGFß2, suggesting that activation of the ET-1 pathway
plays a main role in the IFN-<U+03B3> responses in HDMECs. IFN-<U+03B3> induced expression of
selected genes related to endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT),
including Snail1, FN1, PAI1, TWIST1, STAT3, RGS2, and components of the WNT
pathway. The effect of IFN-<U+03B3> on EndoMT was mediated via TGFß2 and ET-1 signaling 
pathways. This study demonstrates distinct effects of IFN-a and IFN-<U+03B3> on the
biology of vascular endothelial cells. IFN-<U+03B3> may contribute to abnormal vascular 
remodeling and fibrogenesis in SSc, partially via induction of EndoMT.

Craniosynostosis, the premature fusion of the cranial sutures, is a heterogeneous
disorder with a prevalence of ~1 in 2,200 (refs. 1,2). A specific genetic
etiology can be identified in ~21% of cases, including mutations of TWIST1, which
encodes a class II basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, and causes
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, typically associated with coronal synostosis. Using
exome sequencing, we identified 38 heterozygous TCF12 mutations in 347 samples
from unrelated individuals with craniosynostosis. The mutations predominantly
occurred in individuals with coronal synostosis and accounted for 32% and 10% of 
subjects with bilateral and unilateral pathology, respectively. TCF12 encodes one
of three class I E proteins that heterodimerize with class II bHLH proteins such 
as TWIST1. We show that TCF12 and TWIST1 act synergistically in a transactivation
assay and that mice doubly heterozygous for loss-of-function mutations in Tcf12
and Twist1 have severe coronal synostosis. Hence, the dosage of TCF12-TWIST1
heterodimers is critical for normal coronal suture development.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are located in the bone marrow in a specific
microenvironment referred as the hematopoietic stem cell niche, where HSCs
interact with a variety of stromal cells. Though several components of the stem
cell niche have been identified, the regulatory mechanisms through which such
components regulate the stem cell fate are still unknown. In order to address
this issue, we investigated how osteoblasts (OBs) can affect the molecular and
functional phenotype of Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells (HSPCs) and vice
versa. For this purpose, human CD34+ cells were cultured in direct contact with
primary human OBs. Our data showed that CD34+ cells cultured with OBs give rise
to higher total cell numbers, produce more CFUs and maintain a higher percentage 
of CD34+CD38- cells compared to control culture. Moreover, clonogenic assay and
long-term culture results showed that co-culture with OBs induces a strong
increase in mono/macrophage precursors coupled to a decrease in the erythroid
ones. Finally, gene expression profiling (GEP) allowed us to study which
signalling pathways were activated in the hematopoietic cell fraction and in the 
stromal cell compartment after coculture. Such analysis allowed us to identify
several cytokine-receptor networks, such as WNT pathway, and transcription
factors, as TWIST1 and FOXC1, that could be activated by co-culture with OBs and 
could be responsible for the biological effects reported above. Altogether our
results indicate that OBs are able to affect HPSCs on 2 different levels: on one 
side, they increase the immature progenitor pool in vitro, on the other side,
they favor the expansion of the mono/macrophage precursors at the expense of the 
erythroid lineage.

Metastasis is the major cause of cancer mortality. A more thorough understanding 
of the mechanisms driving this complex multistep process will aid in the
identification and characterization of therapeutically targetable genetic drivers
of disease progression. We demonstrate that KLF6-SV1, an oncogenic splice variant
of the KLF6 tumor suppressor gene, is associated with increased metastatic
potential and poor survival in a cohort of 671 lymph node-negative breast cancer 
patients. KLF6-SV1 overexpression in mammary epithelial cell lines resulted in an
epithelial-to-mesenchymal-like transition and drove aggressive multiorgan
metastatic disease in multiple in vivo models. Additionally, KLF6-SV1
loss-of-function studies demonstrated reversion to an epithelial and less
invasive phenotype. Combined, these findings implicate KLF6-SV1 as a key driver
of breast cancer metastasis that distinguishes between indolent and lethal
early-stage disease and provides a potential therapeutic target for invasive
breast cancer.

Adult stem cells from the dermis would be an attractive cell source for
therapeutic purposes as well as studying the process of skin aging. Several
studies have reported that human dermal stem/progenitor cells (hDSPCs) with
multipotent properties exist within the dermis of adult human skin. However,
these cells have not been well characterized, because methods for their isolation
or enrichment have not yet been optimized. In the present study, we enriched high
side scatter (SSC(high))-hDSPCs from normal human dermal fibroblasts using a
structural characteristic, intracellular granularity, as a sorting parameter. The
SSC(high)-hDSPCs had high in vitro proliferation properties and expressed high
levels of SOX2 and S100B, similar to previously identified mouse SOX2+ hair
follicle dermal stem cells. The SSC(high)-hDSPCs could differentiate into not
only mesodermal cell types, for example, adipocytes, chondrocytes, and
osteoblasts, but also neuroectodermal cell types, such as neural cells. In
addition, the SSC(high)-hDSPCs exhibited no significant differences in the
expression of nestin, vimentin, SNAI2, TWIST1, versican, and CORIN compared with 
non-hDSPCs. These cells are therefore different from the previously identified
multipotent fibroblasts and skin-derived progenitors. In this study, we suggest
that hDSPCs can be enriched by using characteristic of their high intracellular
granularity, and these SSC(high)-hDSPCs exhibit high in vitro proliferation and
differentiation potentials.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The rs738409 C>G single-nucleotide polymorphism in PNPLA3 leads 
to a missense mutation (I148M) which increases liver fat but does not cause
insulin resistance. We hypothesised that patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease (NAFLD) due to the PNPLA3 variant ('PNPLA3 NAFLD'<U+2009>=<U+2009>PNPLA3-148MM) do not 
have adipose tissue (AT) inflammation in contrast with those with NAFLD due to
obesity ('obese NAFLD').
METHODS: Biopsy specimens of AT were taken, and PNPLA3 genotype and liver fat
((1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy) were determined in 82 volunteers, who were
divided into groups based on either median BMI (obese 36.2<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.7 kg/m(2);
non-obese 26.0<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.4 kg/m(2)) or PNPLA3 genotype. All groups were similar with
respect to age and sex. The PNPLA3 subgroups were equally obese (PNPLA3-148MM,
31.1<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.3 kg/m(2); PNPLA3-148II, 31.2<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.8 kg/m(2)), while the obese and
non-obese subgroups had similar PNPLA3 genotype distribution. Gene expression of 
proinflammatory (MCP-1, CD68) and anti-inflammatory (Twist1, ADIPOQ) markers was 
measured using quantitative real-time RT-PCR.
RESULTS: Liver fat was similarly increased in obese NAFLD (9.5<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.3% vs
5.1<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.9%, obese vs non-obese, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.007) and PNPLA3 NAFLD (11.4<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.7% vs
5.3<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.8%, PNPLA3-148MM vs PNPLA3-148II, p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). Fasting serum insulin was
higher in the obese than the non-obese group (76<U+2009>±<U+2009>6 vs 47<U+2009>±<U+2009>6 pmol/l,
p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001), but similar in PNPLA3-148MM and PNPLA3-148II (60<U+2009>±<U+2009>8 vs
62<U+2009>±<U+2009>5 pmol/l, NS). In obese vs non-obese, MCP-1 and CD68 mRNAs were upregulated,
whereas those of Twist1 and ADIPOQ were significantly downregulated. AT gene
expression of MCP-1, CD68, Twist1 and ADIPOQ was similar in PNPLA3-148MM and
PNPLA3-148II groups.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: PNPLA3 NAFLD is characterised by an increase in liver
fat but no insulin resistance or AT inflammation, while obese NAFLD has all three
of these features.

Up-regulation of MBD1 promotes pancreatic cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal
transition and invasion by epigenetic down-regulation of E-cadherin.

Methyl-CpG binding domain protein 1 (MBD1) has been implicated in transcriptional
regulation, heterochromatin formation, genomic stability, cell-cycle progression 
and development. It is also predicted that MBD1 might be involved in tumor
development and progression. However, whether and how MBD1 is involved in
tumorigenesis, especially in pancreatic cancer (PC), is currently unknown. We
found that MBD1 was significantly up-regulated in PC tissues compared with the
surrounding normal tissues according to RT-PCR data. Tissue microarray (TMA)
based immunohistochemical study from 58 surgically resected PC specimens
indicated that higher MBD1 expression correlated with lymph node metastasis and
poor survival in PC patients. Gain- and loss-of-function studies in vitro
validated MBD1 as a potent oncogene promoting PC cell invasion as well as
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanistically, MBD1 is associated with
Twist and NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), thereby forming the
Twist-MBD1-SIRT1 complex on the CDH1 promoter, which resulted in reduced
E-cadherin transcription activity and increased cell EMT ability. Significantly, 
targeting MBD1 reversed the EMT phenotype of PC and restored sensitivity to
chemotherapy. Taken together, the results of our study revealed a novel function 
of MBD1 in PC invasion and metastasis by providing a molecular mechanism
underlying MBD1-promoted EMT. Thus MBD1 may serve as a potential therapeutic
target for PC.

Twist1 induces CCL2 and recruits macrophages to promote angiogenesis.

The transcription factor Twist1 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition and
extracellular matrix degradation to promote tumor metastasis. Although Twist1
also plays a role in embryonic vascular development and tumor angiogenesis, the
molecular mechanisms that underlie these processes are not as well understood.
Here, we report a novel function for Twist1 in modifying the tumor
microenvironment to promote progression. We found that expression of Twist1 in
human mammary epithelial cells potently promoted angiogenesis. Surprisingly,
Twist1 expression did not increase the secretion of the common proangiogenic
factors VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor but rather induced expression of 
the macrophage chemoattractant CCL2. Attenuation of endogenous Twist1 in vivo
blocked macrophage recruitment and angiogenesis, whereas exogenous CCL2 rescued
the ability of tumor cells lacking Twist1 to attract macrophages and promote
angiogenesis. Macrophage recruitment also was essential for the ability of
Twist1-expressing cells to elicit a strong angiogenic response. Together, our
findings show that how Twist1 recruits stromal macrophages through CCL2 induction
to promote angiogenesis and tumor progression. As Twist1 expression has been
associated with poor survival in many human cancers, this finding suggests that
anti-CCL2 therapy may offer a rational strategy to treat Twist1-positive
metastatic cancers.

Despite the growing evidence demonstrating that TWIST1 is a noteworthy tumor
biomarker, little is known about the clinical significance of TWIST1 methylation 
in human primary pancreatic cancer. In the present study, the association of
TWIST1 methylation with clinicopathological characteristics was examined in human
primary pancreatic cancer. Primary pancreatic cancer specimens and corresponding 
healthy pancreatic non-tumorous tissues from 33 patients with pancreatic cancer
were used. Methylation levels of TWIST1 were compared with clinicopathological
characteristics. The TWIST1 methylation level was higher in pancreatic cancer
compared to corresponding non-neoplastic pancreatic tissues. The mean TWIST1
methylation was 66.7% for pancreatic cancer tissue and 15.0% for corresponding
nonneoplastic pancreatic tissue (P=0.0004). These results suggested that TWIST1
methylation is a useful biomarker for the screening of pancreatic cancers.
Studies using independent data sets are required to confirm these findings.

Tumor dissemination and metastatic behavior account for the vast majority of
cancer associated mortality. Epithelial tumors achieve this progressive state via
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT); however, the importance of this
process in the neuroepithelial context is currently very controversially
discussed. The review describes the current research status concerning EMT-like
changes in malignant gliomas including the role of TWIST1, ZEB1/ZEB2 and
SNAIl1/SNAIl2 as inducers for cell-invasiveness in GBMs. Furthermore,
WNT/ß-catenin signaling with its key-component FRIZZLED4 activating an EMT-like
program in malignant gliomas and its relationship to the stem-like phenotype as
well as discoveries on micro-RNA-level regulating the EMT-like process are
discussed.

Olfactomedin-1 activity identifies a cell invasion checkpoint during
epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the chick embryonic heart.

Endothelia in the atrioventricular (AV) canal of the developing heart undergo a
prototypical epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) to begin heart valve
formation. Using an in vitro invasion assay, an extracellular matrix protein,
Olfactomedin-1 (OLFM1), was found to increase mesenchymal cell numbers in AV
canals from embryonic chick hearts. Treatment with both anti-OLFM1 antibody and
siRNA targeting OLFM1 inhibits mesenchymal cell formation. OLFM1 does not alter
cell proliferation, migration or apoptosis. Dispersion, but lack of invasion in
the presence of inhibiting antibody, identifies a specific role for OLFM1 in cell
invasion during EMT. This role is conserved in other epithelia, as OLFM1
similarly enhances invasion by MDCK epithelial cells in a transwell assay.
Synergy is observed when TGFß2 and OLFM1 are added to MDCK cell cultures,
indicating that OLFM-1 activity is cooperative with TGFß. Inhibition of both
OLFM1 and TGFß in heart invasion assays shows a similar cooperative role during
development. To explore OLFM1 activity during EMT, representative EMT markers
were examined. Effects of OLFM1 protein and anti-OLFM1 on transcripts of
cell-cell adhesion molecules and the transcription factors Snail-1, Snail-2,
Twist1 and Sox-9 argue that OLFM1 does not initiate EMT. Rather, regulation of
transcripts of Zeb1 and Zeb2, secreted proteases and mesenchymal cell markers by 
both OLFM1 and anti-OLFM1 is consistent with regulation of the cell invasion step
of EMT. We conclude that OLFM1 is present and necessary during EMT in the
embryonic chick heart. Its role in cell invasion and mesenchymal cell gene
regulation suggests an invasion checkpoint in EMT where OLFM1 acts to promote
cell invasion into the three-dimensional matrix.

The mesenchymal architecture of the cranial mesoderm of mouse embryos is
disrupted by the loss of Twist1 function.

The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist1 is a key regulator of
craniofacial development. Twist1-null mouse embryos exhibit failure of cephalic
neural tube closure and abnormal head development and die at E11.0. To dissect
the function of Twist1 in the cranial mesoderm beyond mid-gestation, we used
Mesp1-Cre to delete Twist1 in the anterior mesoderm, which includes the
progenitors of the cranial mesoderm. Deletion of Twist1 in mesoderm cells
resulted in loss and malformations of the cranial mesoderm-derived skeleton. Loss
of Twist1 in the mesoderm also resulted in a failure to fully segregate the
mesoderm and the neural crest cells, and the malformation of some cranial neural 
crest-derived tissues. The development of extraocular muscles was compromised
whereas the differentiation of branchial arch muscles was not affected,
indicating a differential requirement for Twist1 in these two types of
craniofacial muscle. A striking effect of the loss of Twist1 was the inability of
the mesodermal cells to maintain their mesenchymal characteristics, and the
acquisition of an epithelial-like morphology. Our findings point to a role of
Twist1 in maintaining the mesenchyme architecture and the progenitor state of the
mesoderm, as well as mediating mesoderm-neural crest interactions in craniofacial
development.

We report a male infant with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and very severe
multi-sutural craniosynostosis associated with increased intracranial pressure,
marked displacement of brain structures, and extensive erosion of the skull.
While uni- or bi-sultural craniosynostosis is a recognized (though relatively
uncommon) feature of 22q11 deletion syndrome, a severe multi-sutural presentation
of this nature has never been reported. SNP Microarray was otherwise normal and
the patient did not have common mutations in FGFR2, FGFR3, or TWIST associated
with craniosynostosis. While markedly variable expressivity is an acknowledged
feature of deletion 22q11 syndrome, herein we also consider and discuss the
possibility that this infant may have been additionally affected with an
undiagnosed single gene disorder.

AIM: To construct an eukaryotic expression vector of human Twist1 and investigate
the relationship between Twist1 overexpression and tumor invasion in human tongue
squamous cell carcinoma cell line Tca8113.
METHODS: Total mRNA isolated from Tca8113 cells were reversely transcribed to
cDNA. Human Twist1 was amplified using specific PCR primers and then subcloned
into the pcDNA3.1-myc-hisA vector. The fusion expression plasmid was named
Myc-Twist1. Myc-Twist1 was transfected into Tca8113 cells and examined by Western
blotting. The localization of Twist1 in Tca8113 cells was observed using confocal
laser scanning microscopy. E-cadherin promoter activity in response to Myc-Twist1
overexpression was measured by the dual luciferase reporter assay system.
Transwell cell migration assay was performed to detect the invasive capacity of
Tca8113 cells stably expressing Myc-Twist1.
RESULTS: The fusion protein Myc-Twist1 was successfully constructed into
eukaryotic expression vector. Western blotting showed that Myc-Twist1 was stably 
expressed in Tca8113 cells and it was localized mainly in the nucleus and a
little in the cytoplasm. The Twist1 significantly inhibited the E-cadherin
promoter activity and enhanced the cell invasion.
CONCLUSION: Twist1 promotes tumor invasion by down-regulating E-cadherin
expression in Tca8113 cells.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is frequently associated with fibrosis
and a prominent inflammatory infiltrate in the desmoplastic stroma. Moreover, in 
PDAC, an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is observed. To explore a
possible connection between the infiltrating cells, particularly the
polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and the tumor cell transition, biopsies of
patients with PDAC (n = 115) were analysed with regard to PMN infiltration and
nuclear expression of ß-catenin and of ZEB1, well-established indicators of EMT. 
In biopsies with a dense PMN infiltrate, a nuclear accumulation of ß-catenin and 
of ZEB1 was observed. To address the question whether PMN could induce EMT, they 
were isolated from healthy donors and were cocultivated with pancreatic tumor
cells grown as monolayers. Rapid dyshesion of the tumor cells was seen, most
likely due to an elastase-mediated degradation of E-cadherin. In parallel, the
transcription factor TWIST was upregulated, ß-catenin translocated into the
nucleus, ZEB1 appeared in the nucleus, and keratins were downregulated. EMT was
also induced when the tumor cells were grown under conditions preventing
attachment to the culture plates. Here, also in the absence of elastase,
E-cadherin was downmodulated. PMN as well as prevention of adhesion induced EMT
also in liver cancer cell line. In conclusion, PMN via elastase induce EMT in
vitro, most likely due to the loss of cell-to-cell contact. Because in pancreatic
cancers the transition to a mesenchymal phenotype coincides with the PMN
infiltrate, a contribution of the inflammatory response to the induction of EMT
and-by implication-to tumor progression is possible.

TWIST1 is an ERK1/2 effector that promotes invasion and regulates MMP-1
expression in human melanoma cells.

Tumor cells often use developmental processes to progress toward advanced
disease. The E-box transcription factor TWIST1 is essential to
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration in the developing
neural crest. In melanoma, which derives from the neural crest cell lineage,
enhanced TWIST1 expression has been linked to worse clinical prognosis. However, 
mechanisms underlying TWIST1 expression and whether aberrant TWIST1 levels
promote steps in melanoma progression remain unknown. Here, we report that
elevated TWIST1 mRNA/protein expression is dependent on extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling, which is hyperactive in the majority 
of melanomas. We show that TWIST1 protein levels are especially high in melanoma 
cell lines generated from invasive, premetastatic stage tumors. Furthermore,
TWIST1 expression is required and sufficient to promote invasion through Matrigel
and spheroid outgrowth in three-dimensional dermal-mimetic conditions.
Alterations to spheroid outgrowth were not as a result of altered cell death,
cell-cycle profile, or paradigm EMT protein changes. Importantly, we identify
matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) as a novel downstream target of TWIST1. We
have determined that TWIST1 acts, in a dose-dependent manner, as a mediator
between hyperactive ERK1/2 signaling and regulation of MMP-1 transcription.
Together, these studies mechanistically show a previously unrecognized interplay 
between ERK1/2, TWIST1, and MMP-1 that is likely significant in the progression
of melanoma toward metastasis.

adipocyte inflammation.

Low-grade chronic inflammation is a major characteristic of obesity and results
from deregulated white adipose tissue function. Consequently, there is interest
in identifying the underlying regulatory mechanisms and components that drive
adipocyte inflammation. Here, we report that expression of the transcriptional
corepressor complex subunits GPS2 and SMRT was significantly reduced in obese
adipose tissue, inversely correlated to inflammatory status, and was restored
upon gastric bypass surgery-induced weight loss in morbid obesity. These
alterations correlated with reduced occupancy of the corepressor complex at
inflammatory promoters, providing a mechanistic explanation for elevated
inflammatory transcription. In support of these correlations, RNAi-mediated
depletion of GPS2 and SMRT from cultured human adipocytes promoted derepression
of inflammatory transcription and elevation of obesity-associated inflammatory
markers, such as IL-6 and MCP-1. Furthermore, we identified a regulatory cascade 
containing PPAR<U+03B3> and TWIST1 that controlled the expression of GPS2 and SMRT in
human adipocytes. These findings were clinically relevant, because treatment of
diabetic obese patients with pioglitazone, an antidiabetic and antiinflammatory
PPAR<U+03B3> agonist, restored expression of TWIST1, GPS2, and SMRT in adipose tissue.
Collectively, our findings identify alterations in a regulatory transcriptional
network in adipocytes involving the dysregulation of a specific corepressor
complex as among the initiating events promoting adipose tissue inflammation in
human obesity.

Regenerative activity of the lung after epithelial injury.

Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California San Francisco, San
Francisco, CA 94143, USA.

Lung epithelial cells use remarkably adaptive sensing and signaling systems to
maintain a physiological state supporting gas exchange and minimizing
environmental insults. One facet of epithelial adaptability is the reversible
acquisition of mesenchymal features, a process termed epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT). Although in the adult, permanent and complete EMT appears rare 
or non-existent, a growing body of evidence implicates a critical role for the
activation of EMT signaling in tissue remodeling, including fibrotic lung
disease. The specific phenotypes of cells undergoing EMT re-programming during
epithelial responses to injury continue to be defined and are reviewed here.
Several recent studies implicate epithelial expression of canonical EMT
transcription factors, such as Snail and Twist1, with the acquisition of a less
differentiated, more proliferative stem-like state, providing an additional link 
between activation of EMT signaling and tissue repair. In lung airways,
proliferating variant clara cells rely upon Snail for effective epithelial
repair, and in the breast, cells possessing the greatest regenerative capacity
also express Snail2. The ongoing elucidation of signaling underlying epithelial
stem/progenitor expansion coincides with recent discoveries implicating
regenerative activity in the lung, possibly including de novo regeneration of
airway and alveolar units. It remains largely unknown what signals drive
organization of epithelial progenitor cells that expand after lung injury, to
what degree such organization is ever functionally relevant, and whether the lung
regenerative potential recently observed in mouse models extends to humans. Yet
these unknowns with clinical potential bring future mechanistic studies of EMT
and lung repair directly into the field of regenerative medicine. This article is
part of a Special Issue entitled: Fibrosis: Translation of basic research to
human disease.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is implicated in converting stationary
epithelial tumor cells into motile mesenchymal cells during metastasis. However, 
the involvement of EMT in metastasis is still controversial, due to the lack of a
mesenchymal phenotype in human carcinoma metastases. Using a spontaneous squamous
cell carcinoma mouse model, we show that activation of the EMT-inducing
transcription factor Twist1 is sufficient to promote carcinoma cells to undergo
EMT and disseminate into blood circulation. Importantly, in distant sites,
turning off Twist1 to allow reversion of EMT is essential for disseminated tumor 
cells to proliferate and form metastases. Our study demonstrates in vivo the
requirement of "reversible EMT" in tumor metastasis and may resolve the
controversy on the importance of EMT in carcinoma metastasis.

AIMS:   To evaluate the biological roles and prognostic significance of the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-mediating transcription factors (TFs)
Twist, ZEB1 and Slug in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). EMT 
has been shown to enhance solid tumour metastasis, invasion, and proliferation.
METHODS AND RESULTS:   Expression of Twist, ZEB1 and Slug was evaluated
immunohistochemically in eight samples from reactive lymphoid tissues and in
diagnostic samples from 102 DLBCL patients treated with curative intent with
R-CHOP-type chemotherapy. ZEB1 and Slug expression correlated with adverse
disease presentation. However, cytoplasmic Slug expression was linked to a
favourable disease outcome, whereas nuclear expression of ZEB1 indicated an
adverse outcome.
CONCLUSIONS:   This study shows that an EMT-like process occurs in lymphomas. Of 
the TFs investigated, ZEB1 seems to be the main one associated with adverse
clinical presentation and clinical outcome. Surprisingly, Slug expression in
cytoplasm was linked to a favourable prognosis. Further studies are needed to
evaluate whether inhibition of ZEB1 could serve as a therapeutic target.

ARTEMIN promotes de novo angiogenesis in ER negative mammary carcinoma through
activation of TWIST1-VEGF-A signalling.

Banerjee A(1), Wu ZS, Qian PX, Kang J, Liu DX, Zhu T, Lobie PE.

Author information: 
(1)Liggins Institute, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.

The neurotrophic factor ARTEMIN (ARTN) has been reported to possess a role in
mammary carcinoma progression and metastasis. Herein, we report that ARTN
modulates endothelial cell behaviour and promotes angiogenesis in ER-mammary
carcinoma (ER-MC). Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) do not express 
ARTN but respond to exogenously added, and paracrine ARTN secreted by ER-MC
cells. ARTN promoted endothelial cell proliferation, migration, invasion and 3D
matrigel tube formation. Angiogenic behaviour promoted by ARTN secreted by ER-MC 
cells was mediated by AKT with resultant increased TWIST1 and subsequently VEGF-A
expression. In a patient cohort of ER-MC, ARTN positively correlated with VEGF-A 
expression as measured by Spearman's rank correlation analysis. In xenograft
experiments, ER-MC cells with forced expression of ARTN produced tumors with
increased VEGF-A expression and increased microvessel density (CD31 and CD34)
compared to tumors formed by control cells. Functional inhibition of ARTN by
siRNA decreased the angiogenic effects of ER-MC cells. Bevacizumab (a humanized
monoclonal anti-VEGF-A antibody) partially inhibited the ARTN mediated angiogenic
effects of ER-MC cells and combined inhibition of ARTN and VEGF-A by the same
resulted in further significant decrease in the angiogenic effects of ER-MC
cells. Thus, ARTN stimulates de novo tumor angiogenesis mediated in part by
VEGF-A. ARTN therefore co-ordinately regulates multiple aspects of tumor growth
and metastasis.

Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21231-2410, USA.

PURPOSE: Despite improvements in chemoradiation, local control remains a major
clinical problem in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The Hedgehog
pathway has been implicated in tumor recurrence by promoting survival of
tumorigenic precursors and through effects on tumor-associated stroma. Whether
Hedgehog inhibition can affect radiation efficacy in vivo has not been reported.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We evaluated the effects of a targeted Hedgehog inhibitor 
(HhAntag) and radiation on clonogenic survival of human non-small cell lung
cancer lines in vitro. Using an A549 cell line xenograft model, we examined tumor
growth, proliferation, apoptosis, and gene expression changes after concomitant
HhAntag and radiation. In a transgenic mouse model of Kras(G12D)-induced and
Twist1-induced lung adenocarcinoma, we assessed tumor response to radiation and
HhAntag by serial micro-computed tomography (CT) scanning.
RESULTS: In 4 human lung cancer lines in vitro, HhAntag showed little or no
effect on radiosensitivity. By contrast, in both the human tumor xenograft and
murine inducible transgenic models, HhAntag enhanced radiation efficacy and
delayed tumor growth. By use of the human xenograft model to differentiate tumor 
and stromal effects, mouse stromal cells, but not human tumor cells, showed
significant and consistent downregulation of Hedgehog pathway gene expression.
This was associated with increased tumor cell apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted Hedgehog pathway inhibition can increase in vivo radiation 
efficacy in lung cancer preclinical models. This effect is associated with
pathway suppression in tumor-associated stroma. These data support clinical
testing of Hedgehog inhibitors as a component of multimodality therapy for
locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

Differential configurations involving binding of USF transcription factors and
Twist1 regulate Alx3 promoter activity in mesenchymal and pancreatic cells.

During embryonic development, the aristaless-type homeodomain protein Alx3 is
expressed in the forehead mesenchyme and contributes to the regulation of
craniofacial development. In the adult, Alx3 is expressed in pancreatic islets
where it participates in the control of glucose homoeostasis. In the present
study, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of Alx3 gene expression in 
these two cell types. We found that the Alx3 promoter contains two E-box
regulatory elements, named EB1 and EB2, that provide binding sites for the basic 
helix-loop-helix transcription factors Twist1, E47, USF (upstream stimulatory
factor) 1 and USF2. In primary mouse embryonic mesenchymal cells isolated from
the forehead, EB2 is bound by Twist1, whereas EB1 is bound by USF1 and USF2.
Integrity of both EB1 and EB2 is required for Twist1-mediated transactivation of 
the Alx3 promoter, even though Twist1 does not bind to EB1, indicating that
binding of USF1 and USF2 to this element is required for Twist1-dependent Alx3
promoter activity. In contrast, in pancreatic islet insulin-producing cells, the 
integrity of EB2 is not required for proximal promoter activity. The results of
the present study indicate that USF1 and USF2 are important regulatory factors
for Alx3 gene expression in different cell types, whereas Twist1 contributes to
transcriptional transactivation in mesenchymal, but not in pancreatic, cells.

Stem cell migration is a critical step during the repair of damaged tissues. In
order to achieve appropriate cell-based therapies for tooth and periodontal
ligament repair it is necessary first to understand the dynamics of
tissue-specific stem cell populations such as dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) and
dental follicle stem cells (DFSC). Using time-lapse imaging, we analysed
migratory and proliferative capabilities of these two human stem cell lines in
vitro. When cultured alone, both DPSC and DFSC exhibited low and irregular
migration profiles. In co-cultures, DFSC, but not DPSC, spectacularly increased
their migration activity and velocity. DFSC rapidly surrounded the DPSC, thus
resembling the in vivo developmental process, where follicle cells encircle both 
dental epithelium and pulp. Cell morphology was dependent on the culture
conditions (mono-culture or co-culture) and changed over time. Regulatory genes
involved in dental cell migration and differentiation such as TWIST1, MSX1,
RUNX2, SFRP1 and ADAM28, were also evaluated in co-cultures. MSX1 up-regulation
indicates that DPSC and DFSC retain their odontogenic potential. However, DPSC
lose their capacity to differentiate into odontoblasts in the presence of DFSC,
as suggested by RUNX2 up-regulation and TWIST1 down-regulation. In contrast, the 
unchanged levels of SFRP1 expression suggest that DFSC retain their potential to 
form periodontal tissues even in the presence of DPSC. These findings demonstrate
that stem cells behave differently according to their environment, retain their
genetic memory, and compete with each other to acquire the appropriate territory.
Understanding the mechanisms involved in stem cell migration may lead to new
therapeutic approaches for tooth repair.

Choroid plexus papillomas: advances in molecular biology and understanding of
tumorigenesis.

Choroid plexus papillomas are rare, benign tumors originating from the choroid
plexus. Although generally found within the ventricular system, they can arise
ectopically in the brain parenchyma or disseminate throughout the neuraxis. We
sought to review recent advances in our understanding of the molecular biology
and oncogenic pathways associated with this disease. A comprehensive PubMed
literature review was conducted to identify manuscripts discussing the clinical, 
molecular, and genetic features of choroid plexus papillomas. Articles concerning
diagnosis, treatment, and long-term patient outcomes were also reviewed. The
introduction of atypical choroid plexus papilloma as a distinct entity has
increased the need for accurate histopathologic diagnosis. Advances in
immunohistochemical staining have improved our ability to differentiate choroid
plexus papillomas from other intracranial tumors or metastatic lesions using
combinations of key markers and mitotic indices. Recent findings have implicated 
Notch3 signaling, the transcription factor TWIST1, platelet-derived growth factor
receptor, and the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand pathway
in choroid plexus papilloma tumorigenesis. A combination of commonly occurring
chromosomal duplications and deletions has also been identified. Surgical
resection remains the standard of care, although chemotherapy and radiotherapy
may be considered for recurrent or metastatic lesions. While generally considered
benign, these tumors possess a complex biology that sheds insight into other
choroid plexus tumors, particularly malignant choroid plexus carcinomas.
Improving our understanding of the molecular biology, genetics, and oncogenic
pathways associated with this tumor will allow for the development of targeted
therapies and improved outcomes for patients with this disease.

HBx-dependent activation of Twist mediates STAT3 control of
epithelium-mesenchymal transition of liver cells.

Author information: 
(1)Medical Laboratory, Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Xiamen 361009,

This study investigated the molecular mechanisms of liver cells with HBx
expression on epithelium-mesenchymal transition (EMT) change using Western blot
analysis and Transwell assay to assess EMT-related protein expression and cell
mobility. Luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
assay were used to test the Twist promoter containing different STAT3 binding
loci. Electrophoretic mobility band-shift assay (EMSA) was used to detect Twist
activity. Results showed that HBx expression affected the EMT-related protein
expression and the cell mobility of liver cancer cells (MHCC97) and liver cells
(HL-7702) in vitro or in vivo. These proteins exhibited reversed expression to a 
certain extent after Twist inhibition. In addition, the wound-healing capability 
and the mobility of HL-7702/HBx cells were lower than those treated with
control-siRNA. The expressions of p-STAT3 and Twist were positively correlated
with HBx expression. The second STAT-3 binding sequence in the Twist promoter
region of the HL-7702/HBx cells was the first locus. Twist activity in the
HL-7702/HBx2 cells was higher than that in HL-7702 cells. Moreover, the activity 
decreased when the cells were treated with HBx-siRNA to inhibit HBx expression,
or with STAT3 inhibitor to reduce STAT3 activation. Therefore, Twist is essential
for the regulation of the mobility of liver cells with HBx expression. HBx
activates the Twist promoter by activating STAT3 and promotes EMT occurrence in
liver cells.

[Expression and significance of Twist1 and MMP-2 in endometrial endometrioid
adenocarcinoma].

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of Twist1 and MMP-2 protein and their
significance in endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: The expression of Twist1 and MMP-2 protein in 70 cases of endometrial
endometrioid adenocarcinoma was detected on tissue chips using
immunohistochemical staining.
RESULTS: The positive rates of Twist1 and MMP-2 protein expression were 65.7% and
67.1%, respectively. Both of the high expressions of Twist1 and MMP-2 were
positively correlated with FIGO staging and tumor myometrial invasion (P < 0.05, 
respectively). Also the high expression of Twist1 was positively correlated with 
ovarian metastasis and the expression of MMP-2 was positively correlated with
tumor grading (P < 0.05). The patients' overall survival and relapse-free
survival in the group of high Twist1 expression were shorter than that in the
group of low Twist1 expression (P < 0.05). The expression of MMP-2 was positively
correlated with Twist1 expression (P < 0.01, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The expression of Twist1 may be closely correlated with the tumor
invasion, metastasis and prognosis in patients with endometrial endometrioid
adenocarcinoma. The expression of Twist1 has a close relationship with MMP-2 in
endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma.

metastases as a surrogate for primary tumor metastatic potential in breast
cancer.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancers are phenotypically and genotypically heterogeneous
tumors containing multiple cancer cell populations with various metastatic
potential. Aggressive tumor cell subpopulations might more easily be captured in 
lymph nodes metastases (LNM) than in primary tumors (PT). We evaluated mRNA and
protein levels of master EMT regulators: TWIST1, SNAIL and SLUG, protein levels
of EMT-related markers: E-cadherin, vimentin, and expression of classical breast 
cancer receptors: HER2, ER and PgR in PT and corresponding LNM. The results were 
correlated with clinicopathological data and patients outcomes.
METHODS: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from PT and matched LNM from 42
stage II-III breast cancer patients were examined. Expression of TWIST1, SNAIL
and SLUG was measured by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR. Protein
expression was examined by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays.
Kaplan-Meier curves for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS)
were compared using F-Cox test. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI) were computed using Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: On average, mRNA expression of TWIST1, SNAIL and SLUG was significantly 
higher in LNM compared to PT (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.00001 for all). Gene and protein levels of
TWIST1, SNAIL and SLUG were highly discordant between PT and matched LNM.
Increased mRNA expression of TWIST1 and SNAIL in LNM was associated with shorter 
OS (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.04 and P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02, respectively) and DFS (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02 and P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01,
respectively), whereas their expression in PT had no prognostic impact.
Negative-to-positive switch of SNAIL protein correlated with decreased OS and DFS
(HR<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.6; 1.1-18.7; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.03 and HR<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.8; 1.0-48.7; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: LNM are enriched in cells with more aggressive phenotype, marked by 
elevated levels of EMT regulators. High expression of TWIST1 and SNAIL in LNM, as
well as negative-to-positive conversion of SNAIL confer worse prognosis,
confirming the correlation of EMT with aggressive disease behavior. Thus,
molecular profiling of LNM may be used as surrogate marker for aggressiveness and
metastatic potential of PT.

associated with metastasis and poor prognosis. In this study, we examined their
potential roles in phyllodes tumor (PT). The expression of TWIST1, Snail, Slug,
SIP1, and NF-<U+03BA>B in benign (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>103), borderline (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>38), and malignant (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>38) 
PTs was examined by immunostaining. The methylation status of the TWIST1 promoter
was analyzed by methylation-specific PCR. We detected high expression levels of
TWIST1 in 47.4 % of borderline/malignant PTs and 31.1 % of benign PTs, Slug in
64 % of borderline/malignant PTs and 62.1 % of benign PTs, epithelial SIP1 in
75.0 % of borderline/malignant PTs and 86.3 % of benign PTs, stromal SIP1 in
35.5 % of borderline/malignant PTs and 22.3 % of benign PTs, and NF-<U+03BA>B in 63.2 % 
of borderline/malignant PTs and 52.4 % of benign PTs. Snail expression was
detected in all cases. A high expression of TWIST1 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.026) and TWIST1
promoter methylation (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.000) were significantly more frequent in
borderline/malignant PTs than in benign PTs. Moreover, a high expression of at
least four of the five antibodies was more commonly observed in
borderline/malignant PTs than in benign PTs (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.026). However, no relationship
was found between the expression of TWIST1 or the other proteins examined and the
clinical outcome. Our results suggest that a high expression of TWIST1 and
related proteins plays a pivotal role in the malignant progression of PT.

Resveratrol inhibits TGF-ß1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and
suppresses lung cancer invasion and metastasis.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular process during which
epithelial polarized cells become motile mesenchymal-appearing cells, which in
turn promotes carcinoma invasion and metastasis. Resveratrol
(trans-3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene) is a natural polyphenolic compound found in
grapes, red wine and several other plants. Numerous reports in the literature
indicate that resveratrol can suppress cancer invasion and metastasis. However,
the underlying mechanisms of inhibiting metastasis by resveratrol are complex,
not fully elucidated and the subject of intense scientific debate. Despite
evidence indicating that EMT can be a target for resveratrol, little is known
about the effect of resveratrol on lung cancer cells. Our previous studies
demonstrated that TGF-ß1 induces EMT to promote lung adenocarcinoma invasion and 
metastasis. To understand the repressive role of resveratrol in lung cancer
invasion and metastasis, we sought to investigate the potential use of
resveratrol as an inhibitor of TGF-ß1-induced EMT development in A549 lung cancer
cells in vitro. Here we show that when A549 cells are treated with TGF-ß1 and
resveratrol, the latter inhibits the initiation of TGF-ß1-induced EMT. Our
results show that 20 µM resveratrol increases expression of the epithelial
phenotype marker E-cadherin and represses the expression of the mesenchymal
phenotype markers, Fibronectin and Vimentin during the initiation of
TGF-ß1-induced EMT. Resveratrol also inhibits expression of EMT-inducing
transcription factors Snail1 and Slug, although the expression of the Twist1
transcription factor remained unchanged. Resveratrol inhibits the TGF-ß1-induced 
increase in cell adhesion, migration and invasion of A549 lung cancer cells.
Taken together, our findings provide new evidence that resveratrol suppresses
lung cancer invasion and metastasis in vitro through inhibiting TGF-ß1-induced
EMT.

Medical University, Chongqing, 400016, People's Republic of China.

BACKGROUND: The high mobility group protein A2 (HMGA2) is an architectural
transcription factor that plays an important role in the development and
progression of many malignant neoplasms. High expression of HMGA2 in gastric
cancer correlates with invasiveness of cancer and is an independent prognostic
factor. The reason for this might be HMGA2 promoting epithelial-mesenchymal
transitions (EMT), which is the key process of metastasis for some underlying
mechanisms.
AIMS: This study was designed to test whether HMGA2 participates in the EMT and
to further understand the underlying mechanisms of EMT promoted by HMGA2.
METHODS: We examined the cell biology and molecular biology changes after
overexpression and knockdown HMGA2 of gastric cancer cells in vitro and vivo. To 
further understand the underlying mechanisms of EMT promoted by HMGA2, based on
our previous study, we examined the changes of target genes of HMGA2 after
overexpression and knockdown HMGA2 of gastric cancer cells.
RESULTS: The results indicated that overexpressing HMGA2 enabled enhancing the
oncogenic properties of gastric epithelial origin cell in vitro and in vivo.
Furthermore, our study showed that HMGA2 was able to elicit EMT and regulate
several genes which are closely related to the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway by directly 
binding to their promoter thereby activating the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: The Wnt/ß-catenin pathway activated by HMGA2 might be the underlying
mechanism of EMT in gastric cancer cells.

MicroRNAs in the imprinted DLK1-DIO3 region repress the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition by targeting the TWIST1 protein signaling network.

Development of metastatic disease accounts for the vast majority of
cancer-related deaths. Nevertheless, few treatments exist that are designed to
specifically inhibit processes that drive tumor metastasis. The imprinted
DLK1-DIO3 region contains tumor-suppressing miRNAs, but their identity and
function remain indeterminate. In this study we identify seven miRNAs in the
imprinted DLK1-DIO3 region that function cooperatively to repress the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a critical step that drives tumor
metastasis, as well as proliferation of carcinoma cells. These seven miRNAs (miRs
300, 382, 494, 495, 539, 543, and 544) repress a signaling network comprising
TWIST1, BMI1, ZEB1/2, and miR-200 family miRNAs and silencing of the cluster,
which occurs via hypermethylation of upstream CpG islands in human ductal
carcinomas, confers morphological, molecular, and function changes consistent
with an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, ectopic expression of
miR-544 independently inhibited proliferation of numerous tumor cell lines by
inducing the ATM cell cycle checkpoint pathway. These results establish the
DLKI-DIO3 miRNA cluster as a critical checkpoint regulating tumor growth and
metastasis and implicate epigenetic modification of the cluster in driving tumor 
progression. These results also suggest that promoter methylation status and
miRNA expression levels represent new diagnostic tools and therapeutic targets to
predict and inhibit, respectively, tumor metastasis in carcinoma patients.

Limb regeneration involves re-establishing a limb development program from cells 
within adult tissues. Identifying molecular handles that provide insight into the
relationship between cell differentiation status and cell lineage is an important
step to study limb blastema cell formation. Here, using single cell PCR, focusing
on newly isolated Twist1 sequences, we molecularly profile axolotl limb blastema 
cells using several progenitor cell markers. We link their molecular expression
profile to their embryonic lineage via cell tracking experiments. We use in situ 
hybridization to determine the spatial localization and extent of overlap of
different markers and cell types. Finally, we show by single cell PCR that the
mature axolotl limb harbors a small but significant population of Twist1(+)
cells.

Raised intracranial pressure is frequent in untreated nonsyndromic unicoronal
synostosis and does not correlate with severity of phenotypic features.

Eley KA(1), Johnson D, Wilkie AO, Jayamohan J, Richards P, Wall SA.

Author information: 
(1)Oxford Craniofacial Unit, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, Oxford,
United Kingdom.

BACKGROUND: In a small number of children with unicoronal synostosis, the
phenotype is mild and the aesthetic benefit of surgical correction is potentially
outweighed by surgical risk. Raised intracranial pressure, however, would
necessitate intervention. The authors documented the incidence of raised
intracranial pressure in children with mild features and/or parental reluctance
to proceed directly to surgery.
METHODS: A retrospective review of all children with (1) a clinical diagnosis of 
nonsyndromic unicoronal synostosis; (2) unicoronal synostosis confirmed on
computed tomographic scanning; (3) negative family history for unicoronal
synostosis; and (4) negative genetic screening (including P250R encoded by FGFR3,
exons IIIa and IIIc in FGFR2 and TWIST1) was completed.
RESULTS: Of the 80 children studied, seven (9 percent) underwent formal
intracranial pressure monitoring because of a combination of mild clinical
features (n = 4) and/or parental reluctance to proceed with surgery (n = 3).
Intracranial pressure monitoring was reported as high in three (42 percent),
borderline in two (29 percent), and normal in two patients (29 percent). The
findings did not correlate with the degree of clinical deformation or age at
presentation. There was little correlation with clinical and radiographic
features of raised intracranial pressure in this genetically screened
nonsyndromic group.
CONCLUSIONS: High or borderline raised intracranial pressure was present in five 
of seven cases. The risk did not correlate with degree of deformity or age at
presentation. Formal intracranial pressure monitoring should be considered in all
children with unicoronal synostosis not proceeding directly to surgical
intervention, in combination with routine long-term follow-up and repeated
intracranial pressure monitoring where indicated.

The bones of the mammalian skull vault form through intramembranous ossification.
Skull bones ossify directly, in a process regulated by ß-catenin, instead of
passing through a cartilage intermediate. We tested whether ß-catenin is
necessary for fate selection of intramembranous bone progenitors in the skull.
Here, we show in mice that removal of ß-catenin from skull bone progenitors
results in the near complete transformation of the skull bones to cartilage,
whereas constitutive ß-catenin activation inhibits skull bone fate selection.
ß-catenin directly activated Twist1 expression in skull progenitors, conditional 
Twist1 deletion partially phenocopied the absence of ß-catenin, and Twist1
deletion partially restored bone formation in the presence of constitutive
ß-catenin activation. Finally, Twist1 bound robustly to the 3'UTR of Sox9, the
central initiator of chondrogenesis, suggesting that Twist1 might directly
repress cartilage formation through Sox9. These findings provide insight into how
ß-catenin signaling via Twist1 actively suppresses the formation of cartilage and
promotes intramembranous ossification in the skull.

Artemin (ARTN) has been reported to promote a TWIST1-dependent epithelial to
mesenchymal transition of estrogen receptor negative mammary carcinoma (ER-MC)
cells associated with metastasis and poor survival outcome. We therefore examined
a potential role of ARTN in the promotion of the cancer stem cell (CSC)-like
phenotype in mammary carcinoma cells. Acquired resistance of ER-MC cells to
either ionizing radiation (IR) or paclitaxel was accompanied by increased ARTN
expression. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of ARTN in either
IR- or paclitaxel-resistant ER-MC cells restored cell sensitivity to IR or
paclitaxel. Expression of ARTN was enriched in ER-MC cells grown in mammospheric 
compared with monolayer culture and was also enriched along with BMI1, TWIST1,
and DVL1 in mammospheric and ALDH1+ populations. ARTN promoted mammospheric
growth and self-renewal of ER-MC cells and increased the ALDH1+ population,
whereas siRNA-mediated depletion of ARTN diminished these CSC-like cell
behaviors. Furthermore, increased ARTN expression was significantly correlated
with ALDH1 expression in a cohort of ER-MC patients. Forced expression of ARTN
also dramatically enhanced tumor initiating capacity of ER-MC cells in xenograft 
models at low inoculum. ARTN promotion of the CSC-like cell phenotype was
mediated by TWIST1 regulation of BCL-2 expression. ARTN also enhanced mammosphere
formation and the ALDH1+ population in estrogen receptor-positive mammary
carcinoma (ER+MC) cells. Increased expression of ARTN and the functional
consequences thereof may be one common adaptive mechanism used by mammary
carcinoma cells to promote cell survival and renewal in hostile tumor
microenvironments.

Investigation of FGFR2-IIIC signaling via FGF-2 ligand for advancing GCT stromal 
cell differentiation.

(1)Department of Surgery, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

Giant cell tumor of bone (GCT) is an aggressive bone tumor consisting of
multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells and proliferating osteoblast-like
stromal cells. The signaling mechanism involved in GCT stromal cell osteoblastic 
differentiation is not fully understood. Previous work in our lab reported that
GCT stromal cells express high levels of TWIST1, a master transcription factor in
skeletal development, which in turn down-regulates Runx2 expression and prevents 
terminal osteoblastic differentiation in these cells. The purpose of this study
was to determine the upstream regulation of TWIST1 in GCT cells. Using GCT
stromal cells obtained from patient specimens, we demonstrated that fibroblast
growth factor receptor (FGFR)-2 signaling plays an essential role in bone
development and promotes differentiation of immature osteoblastic cells.
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 stimulates FGFR-2 expression, resulting in
decreased TWIST1 expression and increased Runx2, alkaline phosphastase (ALP) and 
osteopontin (OPN) expression. Inhibition of FGFR-2 through siRNA decreased the
expression of ALP, Runx2 and OPN in GCT stromal cells. Our study also confirmed
that FGF-2 ligand activates downstream ERK1/2 signaling and pharmacological
inhibition of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway suppresses FGF-2 stimulated osteogenic
differentiation in these cells. Our results indicate a significant role of FGFR-2
signaling in osteoblastic differentiation in GCT stromal cells.

To understand the mechanisms leading to trastuzumab resistance in
HER2-overexpressing breast tumors, we created trastuzumab-insensitive cell lines 
(SKBR3/100-8 and BT474/100-2). The cell lines maintain HER2 receptor
overexpression and show increase in EGF receptor (EGFR). Upon trastuzumab
treatment, SKBR3/100-8 and BT474/100-2 cell lines displayed increased growth rate
and invasiveness. The trastuzumab resistance in SKBR3/100-8 and BT474/100-2 was
accompanied with activation of the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway. Further
investigation found that Wnt3 overexpression played a key role toward the
development of trastuzumab resistance. The expression of Wnt3 in
trastuzumab-resistant cells increased nuclear expression of ß-catenin and
transactivated expression of EGFR. The increased Wnt3 in the
trastuzumab-resistant cells also promoted a partial EMT-like transition
(epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition); increased N-cadherin, Twist, Slug; and
decreased E-cadherin. Knockdown of Wnt3 by siRNA restored cytoplasmic expression 
of ß-catenin and decreased EGFR expression in trastuzumab-resistant cells.
Furthermore, the EMT markers were decreased, E-cadherin was increased, and the
cell invasiveness was inhibited in response to the Wnt3 downregulation.
Conversely, SKBR3 cells which had been stably transfected with full-length Wnt3
exhibited EMT-like transition. The Wnt3 transfectants, SKBR3/Wnt3-7 and
SKBR3/Wnt3-9, showed a significant decrease in E-cadherin and increase in
N-cadherin, Twist, and Slug. The cells were less sensitive to trastuzumab than
parental SKBR3 and vector-transfected cells. In summary, our data suggest that
Wnt3 overexpression activates Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway that leads to
transactivation of EGFR and promotes EMT-like transition. This could be an
important mechanism leading to trastuzumab resistance in HER2-overexpressing
breast cancer cells.

Syndromic craniosynostose exhibit variable clinical and genetic heterogeneity.
Many of this disorders are caused by mutations in the fibroblast growth factor
receptor genes: FGFR2, FGFR3 (encoding fibroblast growth factor receptors),
TWIST1 (functions as an upstream regulator of FGFRs) and EFNB1 (gene encoding
fibrillin1). However recent advances in molecular genetics have led to a discover
of other genes implicated in different craniosynostosis syndromes.

Diagnosis of bladder cancer recurrence based on urinary levels of EOMES, HOXA9,
POU4F2, TWIST1, VIM, and ZNF154 hypermethylation.

BACKGROUND: Non muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) has the highest recurrence
rate of any malignancy and as many as 70% of patients experience relapse.
Aberrant DNA methylation is present in all bladder tumors and can be detected in 
urine specimens. Previous studies have identified DNA methylation markers that
showed significant diagnostic value. We evaluated the significance of the
biomarkers for early detection of tumor recurrence in urine.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The methylation levels of EOMES, HOXA9, POU4F2,
TWIST1, VIM, and ZNF154 in urine specimens were measured by real-time PCR
(MethyLight). We analyzed 390 urine sediments from 184 patients diagnosed with
NMIBC. Urine from 35 age-matched control individuals was used to determine the
methylation baseline levels. Recurrence was diagnosed by cystoscopy and verified 
by histology. Initially, we compared urine from bladder cancer patients and
healthy individuals and detected significant hypermethylation of all six markers 
(P<0.0001) achieving sensitivity in the range 82%-89% and specificity in the
range 94%-100%. Following, we validated the urinary hypermethylation for use in
recurrence surveillance and found sensitivities of 88-94% and specificities of
43-67%. EOMES, POU4F2, VIM and ZNF154 were more frequently methylated in urine
from patients with higher grade tumors (P = 0.08). Univariate Cox regression
analysis showed that five markers were significantly associated with disease
recurrence; HOXA9 (HR=7.8, P=0.006), POU4F2 (HR=8.5, P=0.001), TWIST1 (HR=12.0,
P=0.015), VIM (HR=8.0, P=0.001), and ZNF154 (HR=13.9, P<0.001). Interestingly,
for one group of patients (n=15) we found that hypermethylation was consistently 
present in the urine samples despite the lack of tumor recurrences, indicating
the presence of a field defect.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Methylation levels of EOMES, HOXA9, POU4F2, TWIST1, VIM,
and ZNF154 in urine specimens are promising diagnostic biomarkers for bladder
cancer recurrence surveillance.

An otherwise healthy, developmentally normal 3-week-old male infant presented
with complex multisuture craniosynostosis involving the metopic suture and
bilateral coronal sutures with frontal prominence and hypotelorism. Frontal
craniectomy and bilateral frontoorbital advancement remodeling were performed at 
the age of 5 months. The postoperative course was uneventful. The child's
development was normal up to 8 months after the operation. His father and
grandfather had similar specific deformities of the cranium, but no anomaly of
the extremities was found, and conversation suggested that their intelligence was
normal, excluding the possibility of syndromic craniosynostosis. A DNA analysis
revealed large-scale copy number polymorphism of chromosome 4 in the patient and 
his family, which may include the phenotype of the cranium. Neither FGFR mutation
nor absence of a TWIST1 mutation in the sequence from 291 to 1087, which includes
DNA binding, Helix1, Loop, and Helix2, was identified. The patient apparently had
a rare case of familial nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. The authors plan further
genomic analysis of this family and long-term observation of the craniofacial
deformity of this patient.

We examined 56 malignant mesotheliomas, 117 lung adenocarcinomas, and 34
metastatic lung adenocarcinomas with antibodies to transcription factors involved
in epitheliomesenchymal transition. The tumors were stained immunohistochemically
with antibodies zeb1, twist, and snail. Malignant mesotheliomas exhibited a
stronger expression of zeb1 and twist than lung adenocarcinomas (p < 0.001 for
both). Metastatic adenocarcinomas displayed a more frequent expression of zeb1
and twist (p < 0.001 for both) than lung adenocarcinomas. Patients with snail
positive mesotheliomas experienced a better survival (p = 0.046), whereas in lung
adenocarcinomas, this trait predicted worse survival (p = 0.024). Biphasic
mesotheliomas had a more frequent expression of snail or zeb1 than epithelioid
and sarcomatoid mesotheliomas as a group (p = 0.034 and p = 0.005, respectively).
E-cadherin was more commonly present in epithelioid mesotheliomas (p = 0.002).
Cases with snail positivity showed a significantly lower apoptotic index (p =
0.039). Malignant mesotheliomas display strong twist and zeb1 expression, which
may be an indication of transdifferentiation between the epithelioid and
sarcomatoid cell types with biphasic mesotheliomas representing tumors in active 
transition. Metastatic adenocarcinomas show a higher expression of zeb1 and twist
than primary lung tumors, confirming our previous findings and highlighting their
significance in the metastatic process. Snail expression is associated with poor 
prognosis in lung adenocarcinomas, but an opposite effect was seen in
mesothelioma, a fact which may be related to the different cellular origin of
epithelial and mesothelial cells.

INTRODUCTION: Down-regulation of E-cadherin (CDH1) and epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) are considered critical events for invasion and metastasis of
colorectal carcinoma. Here we tested whether the important regulators of
E-cadherin expression SNAI1 and TWIST1 are already detectable in human colorectal
adenomas.
METHODS: RNA was extracted from a set of randomly selected formalin-fixed and
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) colorectal adenomas (n = 41) and normal colon mucosa (n 
= 10). Subsequently mRNA expression of CDH1, CDH2, SNAI1 and TWIST1 was analysed 
by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. CDH1 as well as SNAI1 protein expression were
assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC).
RESULTS: SNAI1 mRNA was expressed in 78% (n = 32/41), TWIST1 mRNA in 41% (n =
17/41) and CDH2 mRNA in 41% (n = 17/41) of the colorectal adenoma tissue, while
normal colon mucosa was negative for these transcription factors. We found a
significant correlation between reduced CDH1 and the presence of SNAI1 mRNA
expression and for combined SNAI1 and TWIST1 mRNA expression, respectively. A
correlation between CDH2 mRNA expression and reduced CDH1 expression was not
observed. We confirmed the relationship between SNAI1 expression and reduced
E-cadherin expression on the protein level via IHC.
CONCLUSION: Our data show that SNAI1 and Twist1 are already expressed in benign
precursor lesions of colorectal cancer and that SNAI1 expression was
significantly correlated with lower expression of CDH1. Whether these findings
reflect true EMT and/or are a sign of a more aggressive biology need to be
investigated in further studies.

Estrogen receptors ß1 and ß2 have opposing roles in regulating proliferation and 
bone metastasis genes in the prostate cancer cell line PC3.

Signaling, University of Houston, Houston, Texas 77204-5056, USA.

The estrogen receptor (ER)ß1 is successively lost during cancer progression,
whereas its splice variant, ERß2, is expressed in advanced prostate cancer. The
latter form of cancer often metastasizes to bone, and we wanted to investigate
whether the loss of ERß1 and/or the expression of ERß2 affect such signaling
pathways in prostate cancer. Using PC3 and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell lines that 
stably express ERß1 or ERß2, we found that the ERß variants differentially
regulate genes known to affect tumor behavior. We found that ERß1 repressed the
expression of the bone metastasis regulator Runx2 in PC3 cells. By contrast,
RUNX2 expression was up-regulated at the mRNA level by ERß2 in PC3 cells, whereas
Slug was up-regulated by ERß2 in both PC3 and 22Rv1 cells. In addition, the
expression of Twist1, a factor whose expression strongly correlates with high
Gleason grade prostate carcinoma, was increased by ERß2. In agreement with the
increased Twist1 expression, we found increased expression of Dickkopf homolog 1;
Dickkopf homolog 1 is a factor that has been shown to increase the RANK
ligand/osteoprotegerin ratio and enhance osteoclastogenesis, indicating that the 
expression of ERß2 can cause osteolytic cancer. Furthermore, we found that only
ERß1 inhibited proliferation, whereas ERß2 increased proliferation. The
expression of the proliferation markers Cyclin E, c-Myc, and p45(Skp2) was
differentially affected by ERß1 and ERß2 expression. In addition, nuclear
ß-catenin protein and its mRNA levels were reduced by ERß1 expression. In
conclusion, we found that ERß1 inhibited proliferation and factors known to be
involved in bone metastasis, whereas ERß2 increased proliferation and
up-regulated factors involved in bone metastasis. Thus, in prostate cancer cells,
ERß2 has oncogenic abilities that are in strong contrast to the tumor-suppressing
effects of ERß1.

Transcription factors associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition and
cancer stem cells in the tumor centre and margin of invasive breast cancer.

Although tumor surgery aims for a complete resection respecting tumor-specific
safety distance, in many cases the most peripheral part, the invasion front,
remains in situ. Tumor cells at the tumor margin lose epithelial properties and
acquire features of mesenchymal cells. The process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) has been suggested to be of prime importance for tissue and
vessel invasion. Recently, features of EMT were shown to be linked to cells with 
tumor-founding capability, so- called cancer stem cells (CSC). In this study we
show that transcription factors associated with EMT markers Snail, Slug, Twist
and Zeb1 are differentially expressed between normal breast epithelium, ductal
carcinoma in situ and invasive breast cancer. Both invasive and in situ carcinoma
expressed less Slug and Twist and more Zeb1 compared to normal epithelium. Using 
fluorescence multi-staining the number of potential CSC among invasive cancer
cells varied dramatically depending on the staining combination used (18.5% for
CD44(+)/CD24(-) and 2.4% for CD49f(+)/CD24(+)). Interestingly, neither
transcription factors associated with EMT nor potential CSC counts varied between
tumor centre and invasion front. No association of these features with clinical
outcome was detected. Our results suggest that reliable in situ markers for EMT
are missing for invasive breast cancer. Alternatively, the process of EMT might
be activated in tumor cells at the margin as well as the centre. Furthermore, our
data show that the bio-markers of CSC detect very variable cell populations
within breast cancer, challenging the assumption of a hierarchical organization
of CSC in these tumors.

Transcriptional regulation of miR-10a/b by TWIST-1 in myelodysplastic syndromes.

Li X(1), Xu F, Chang C, Byon J, Papayannopoulou T, Deeg HJ, Marcondes AM.

Author information: 
(1)Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle,
WA, USA.

The transcription factor TWIST-1 is up-regulated in CD34(+) cells in
myelodysplastic syndrome and is involved in resistance to apoptosis. There is
evidence that TWIST-1 affects apoptosis via microRNAs (miRs). Expression of miRs 
was determined in myeloid cell lines and primary CD34(+) marrow cells from
patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and healthy donors using NanoString/array 
and validated by real-time-polymerase chain reaction. Expression levels of miR10a
and miR10b were significantly higher in CD34(+) marrow cells from 28 patients
with myelodysplastic syndrome than in CD34(+) cells from healthy donors (P=0.05
and P=0.012, respectively). Levels of miR10a/b correlated with TWIST-1 miR levels
in CD34(+) myelodysplastic marrow cells (miR10a, R=+0.69, P<0.0001; miR10b,
R=+0.56, P=0.0008). Inhibition of miR10a/10b in clonal cells interfered with
proliferation and enhanced sensitivity to apoptosis, which involved
NF-<U+03BA>B-dependent p53 activation. These data support a role for miR10a/10b in the
regulation of apoptosis in myelodysplastic syndrome and suggest the
TWIST-1/miR10a/b-axis as a therapeutic target in myelodysplastic syndrome.

Transcriptional repression of TWIST1 gene by Prospero-related homeobox 1 inhibits
invasiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.

Prospero-related homeobox 1 (PROX1) is important for liver development and
down-regulation of this transcription factor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is
associated with poor prognosis. We find that PROX1 expression is inversely
correlated with the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal regulator TWIST1 in HCC 
cell lines and tumor tissues. We demonstrate that PROX1 directly binds to
proximal promoter of TWIST1 gene to repress its transcription and inhibits its
downstream target gene AKT2 expression which leads to reduction of cell migration
and invasion. Moreover, PROX1 attenuates lung metastasis of HCC in vivo. These
results support an anti-metastatic role of PROX1 via inhibiting TWIST1.

Twist proteins have been shown to contribute to cancer development and
progression by impinging on different regulatory pathways, but their mechanism of
action is poorly defined. By investigating the role of Twist in sarcomas, we
found that Twist1 acts as a mechanism alternative to TP53 mutation and MDM2
overexpression to inactivate p53 in mesenchymal tumors. We provide evidence that 
Twist1 binds p53 C terminus through the Twist box. This interaction hinders key
posttranslational modifications of p53 and facilitates its MDM2-mediated
degradation. Our study suggests the existence of a Twist box code of p53
inactivation and provides the proof of principle that targeting the Twist box:p53
interaction might offer additional avenues for cancer treatment.

Currently, there is extensive information about circulating tumor cells (CTC) and
their prognostic value; however, little is known about other characteristics of
these cells. In this prospective study, we assessed the gene transcripts of
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-inducing transcription factors (EMT-TF) and 
cancer stem cell (CSC) features in patients with HER2(+) metastatic breast cancer
(MBC). Epithelial cells were enriched from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) using antibody-coated anti-CD326 antibody (CD326(+)) magnetic beads, and
the residual CD326(-) PBMCs were further depleted of leukocytes using anti-CD45
antibody-coated magnetic beads (CD326(-)CD45(-)). RNA was extracted from all cell
fractions, reverse transcribed to cDNA, and subjected to quantitative reverse
transcription PCR to detect EMT-TFs (TWIST1, SNAIL1, ZEB1, and TG2) as a measure 
of CTCs undergoing EMT (EMT-CTCs). In addition, PBMCs were analyzed using
multiparameter flow cytometry for ALDH activity and CSCs that express CD24, CD44,
and CD133. Twenty-eight patients were included in this study. At least one EMT-TF
mRNA was elevated in the CTCs of 88.2% of patients and in the CD326(-)CD45(-)
cell fraction of 60.7% of patients. The CD326(-)CD45(-) fraction of patients with
elevated SNAIL1 and ZEB1 transcripts also had a higher percentage of
ALDH(+)/CD133(+) cells in their blood than did patients with normal SNAIL1 and
ZEB1 expression (P = 0.038). Our data indicate that patients with HER2(+) MBCs
have EMT-CTCs. Moreover, an enrichment of CSCs was found in CD326(-)CD45(-)
cells. Additional studies are needed to determine whether EMT-CTCs and CSCs have 
prognostic value in patients with HER2(+) MBCs treated with trastuzumab-based
therapy.

Health Science Center, Dallas, TX 75246, USA.

BACKGROUND: Supernumerary teeth are often observed in patients suffering from
cleidocranial dysplasia due to a mutation in Runx2 that results in
haploinsufficiency. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly
defined. In this study, we assessed the roles of Runx2 and its functional
antagonist Twist1 in regulating fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling using in
vitro biochemical approaches.
RESULTS: We showed that Twist1 stimulated Fgfr2 and Fgf10 expression in a
mesenchymal cell line and that it formed heterodimers with ubiquitously expressed
E12 (together with E47 encoded by E2A gene) and upregulated Fgfr2 and Fgf10
promoter activities in a dental mesenchyme-derived cell line. We further
demonstrated that the bHLH domain of Twist1 was essential for its synergistic
activation of Fgfr2 promoter with E12 and that the binding of E12 stabilized
Twist1 by preventing it from undergoing lysosomal degradation. Although Runx2 had
no apparent effects on Fgfr2 and Fgf10 promoter activities, it inhibited the
stimulatory activity of Twist1 on Fgfr2 promoter.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Runx2 haploinsufficiency might result in
excessive unbound Twist1 that can freely bind to E12 and enhance FGF signaling,
thereby promoting the formation of extra teeth.

A tale with a Twist: a developmental gene with potential relevance for metabolic 
dysfunction and inflammation in adipose tissue.

Dobrian AD(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Physiological Sciences, Eastern Virginia Medical School Norfolk,
VA, USA.

The Twist proteins (Twist-1 and -2) are highly conserved developmental proteins
with key roles for the transcriptional regulation in mesenchymal cell lineages.
They belong to the super-family of bHLH proteins and exhibit bi-functional roles 
as both activators and repressors of gene transcription. The Twist proteins are
expressed at low levels in adult tissues but may become abundantly re-expressed
in cells undergoing malignant transformation. This observation prompted extensive
research on the roles of Twist proteins in cancer progression and metastasis.
Very recent studies indicate a novel role for Twist-1 as a potential regulator of
adipose tissue (AT) remodeling and inflammation. Several studies suggested that
developmental genes are important determinants of obesity, fat distribution and
remodeling capacity of different adipose depots. Twist-1 is abundantly and
selectively expressed in the adult AT and its constitutive expression is
significantly higher in subcutaneous (SAT) vs. visceral (VAT) fat in both mice
and humans. Moreover, Twist1 expression is strongly correlated with BMI and
insulin resistance in humans. However, the functional roles and transcriptional
downstream targets of Twist1 in AT are largely unexplored. The purpose of this
review is to highlight the major findings related to Twist1 expression in
different fat depots and cellular components of AT and to discuss the potential
mechanisms suggesting a role for Twist1 in AT metabolism, inflammation and
remodeling.

High TWIST1 mRNA expression is associated with poor prognosis in lymph
node-negative and estrogen receptor-positive human breast cancer and is
co-expressed with stromal as well as ECM related genes.

Riaz M, Sieuwerts AM, Look MP, Timmermans MA, Smid M, Foekens JA, Martens JW.

INTRODUCTION: The TWIST homolog 1 (TWIST1) is a transcription factor that induces
epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key process in metastasis. The
purpose of this study was to investigate whether TWIST1 expression predicts
disease progression in a large breast cancer cohort with long-term clinical
follow-up, and to reveal the biology related to TWIST1 mediated disease
progression.
METHODS: TWIST1 mRNA expression level was analyzed by quantitative real-time
reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 1,427 primary breast cancers. In
uni- and multivariate analysis using Cox regression, TWIST1 mRNA expression level
was associated with metastasis-free survival (MFS), disease-free survival (DFS)
and overall survival (OS). Separate analyses in lymph node-negative patients
(LNN, n = 778) who did not receive adjuvant systemic therapy, before and after
stratification into estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (n = 552) and ER-negative (n 
= 226) disease, were also performed. The association of TWIST1 mRNA with survival
endpoints was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Using gene expression arrays,
genes showing a significant Spearman rank correlation with TWIST1 were used to
identify overrepresented Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes (KEGG)-annotated biological pathways.
RESULTS: Increased mRNA expression level of TWIST1 analyzed as a continuous
variable in both uni- and multivariate analysis was associated with shorter MFS
in all patients (hazard ratio (HR): 1.17, 95% confidence interval, (95% CI):1.09 
to 1.26; and HR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.26; respectively), in LNN patients (HR: 
1.22, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.36; and HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.36; respectively) and
in the ER-positive subgroup of LNN patients (HR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.53; and 
HR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.53; respectively). Similarly, high TWIST1 expression 
was associated with shorter DFS and OS in all patients and in the LNN/ER-positive
subgroup. In contrast, no association of TWIST1 mRNA expression with MFS, DFS or 
OS was observed in ER-negative patients. Genes highly correlated with TWIST1 were
significantly enriched for cell adhesion and ECM-related signaling pathways.
Furthermore, TWIST1 mRNA was highly expressed in tumor stroma and positively
related to tumor stromal content (P <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: TWIST1 mRNA expression is an independent prognostic factor for poor 
prognosis in LNN/ER-positive breast cancer. The biological associations suggest
an involvement of the tumor microenvironment in TWIST1's adverse role in breast
cancer.

cells through inhibition of Akt and Twist signaling pathway.

Breast cancer metastasis is more resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy than 
is cancer of the visceral tissues; therefore, new treatment strategies are
urgently needed. Moscatilin, derived from the orchid Dendrobrium loddigesii, has 
shown anticancer activity. We evaluated the mechanism by which moscatilin
suppresses the migration and metastasis of human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells
in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that moscatilin significantly inhibits
MDA-MB-231 cell migration by using scratch assays and Boyden chambers.
Transcriptional factors inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition, such as
Twist, Snail, and Akt, play important roles in cell migration and cancer
metastasis. Moscatilin inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of Twist, but
not that of Snail, and subsequently inhibited N-cadherin expression. However,
these effects were reversed by constitutively expressing active myristoylated
(myr)-Akt and Twist overexpression. Moscatilin also suppressed Akt
phosphorylation. However, Akt overexpression reversed the inhibitory effects of
moscatilin on phospho-Akt protein expression but not its effects on Twist. The
moscatilin-mediated inhibition of cell migration was reversed by Akt and Twist
overexpression, demonstrating that moscatilin blocked cell migration by
inhibiting Akt and Twist. In an MDA-MB-231 metastatic animal model, moscatilin
(100 mg/kg) significantly suppressed breast cancer metastasis to the lungs and
reduced the number of metastatic lung nodules and lung weight without causing any
toxicity. These results indicated that moscatilin inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell
migration via Akt- and Twist-dependent pathways; this finding was consistent with
moscatilin's antimetastatic activity in vivo. Therefore, moscatilin may be an
effective compound for the prevention of human breast cancer metastasis.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: To characterise the origin, ultrastructure and functional
properties of corneal limbal neurospheres (LNS).
METHODS: Limbal cells were isolated from the corneal limbus of adult mice and
cultured in a serum-free sphere forming culture system. LNS were characterised by
immunocytochemistry, Reverse-transcription-PCR and electron microscopy. LNS cells
were also cocultured with neonatal mouse retinal cells. Phenotype and function
were then assessed by immunofluorescence and a calcium influx/efflux assay.
RESULTS: LNS cells displayed clonal growth and self-renewal, and expressed a wide
range of stem cell and neural lineage markers. The acquisition of neural
properties was concordant with expression of neural crest markers including CD34,
Sca1, Sox9, Twist1, but not CD45. LNS exhibited similar morphology and
microstructure to neurospheres derived from the central nervous system. Following
culture in a conducive environment, the derived cells displayed mature neural
markers and exhibited electrical excitability.
CONCLUSIONS: Corneal limbal stromal progenitor cells are a potential and
convenient autologous cell source to generate functional neurons.

Hong Kong, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong, China; E-Mail: gushen0419@gmail.com.

Although widely studied in the past decade, our knowledge of the functional role 
of microRNAs (miRNAs) remains limited. Among the many miRNAs identified in
humans, we focus on miR-199a due to its varied and important functions in diverse
models and systems. Its expression is finely regulated by promoter methylation
and direct binding of transcription factors such as TWIST1. During tumorigenesis,
depending on the nature of the cancer, miR-199a, especially its -3p mature form, 
may act as either a potential tumor suppressor or an oncogene. Its 5p mature form
has been shown to protect cardiomyocytes from hypoxic damage via its action on
HIF1a. It also has a functional role in stem cell differentiation, embryo
development, hepatitis, liver fibrosis, etc. Though it has varied biological
activities, its regulation has not been reviewed. The varied and protean
functions of miR-199a suggest that efforts to generalize the action of a miRNA
are problematic. This review provides a comprehensive survey of the literature on
miR-199a as an example of the complexity of miRNA biology and suggests future
directions for miRNA research.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an almost lethal disease. Thus, it is 
important to better understand its genetic progression from normal cells through 
precancerous lesions pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) to invasive
pancreatic cancer. Carriers of a germline mutation in BRCA2 have an increased
risk of developing PDAC when compared with the general population. The purpose of
our study was to examine the role of BRCA2 dysfuction in the progression of PDAC.
Here we generated a novel in vitro model of pancreatic carcinogenesis. Cancerous 
PanIN-BR1 cells were established by stable transduction with lentiviral-mediated 
BRCA2 RNA interference in PanIN cell isolated from mice with oncogenic KrasG12D. 
Our data showed that silencing of BRCA2 promoted cell proliferation, migration
and invasion in vitro. The tumorigenic potential of PanIN-BR1 were assessed by
xenograft tumor formation in BALB/c nude mice. The expression of PCNA , Snail and
Slug in the tumor xenografts was detected by immunohistochemistry. The staining
for PCNA, Snail and Slug in PanIN-BR1-formed xenograft tissue was significantly
more intense than PanIN-formed xenograft tissue. Microarray assay was also
performed. Based on gene expression profiling and further validation by real-time
PCR and Western Blot, we found that the expression of Cyclinb2, Cyclina2, Twist1,
Wisp1 and Cxcr4 revealed a significant increase in the PanIN-BR1 cells, however, 
the expression of p15, p16 and Wisp2 showed a significant decrease in the
PanIN-BR1 cells, compared to the PanIN cells. Collectively, these data reported
here demonstrate that BRCA2 may be a promising therapeutic targets for PDAC
progression.

BACKGROUND: The high frequencies of recurrence and distant metastasis of adenoid 
cystic carcinoma (AdCC) emphasize the need to better understand the biological
factors associated with these outcomes. To analyze the mechanisms of AdCC
metastasis, we established the green fluorescence protein (GFP)-transfected
subline ACCS-GFP from the AdCC parental cell line and the metastatic ACCS-M GFP
line from an in vivo metastasis model.
METHODS: Using these cell lines, we investigated the involvement of the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSCs) in AdCC
metastasis by real-time RT-PCR for EMT related genes and stem cell markers.
Characteristics of CSCs were also analyzed by sphere-forming ability and
tumorigenicity. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) silencing of target gene was also
performed.
RESULTS: ACCS-M GFP demonstrated characteristics of EMT and additionally
displayed sphere-forming ability and high expression of EMT-related genes (Snail,
Twist1, Twist2, Slug, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 and 2 [Zeb1 and Zeb2],
glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta [Gsk3ß and transforming growth factor beta 2
[Tgf-ß2]), stem cell markers (Nodal, Lefty, Oct-4, Pax6, Rex1, and Nanog), and
differentiation markers (sex determining region Y [Sox2], Brachyury, and alpha
fetoprotein [Afp]). These observations suggest that ACCS-M GFP shows the
characteristics of CSCs and CSCs may be involved in the EMT of AdCC.
Surprisingly, shRNA silencing of the T-box transcription factor Brachyury (also a
differentiation marker) resulted in downregulation of the EMT and stem cell
markers. In addition, sphere-forming ability, EMT characteristics, and
tumorigenicity were simultaneously lost. Brachyury expression in clinical samples
of AdCC was extremely high and closely related to EMT. This finding suggests that
regulation of EMT by Brachyury in clinical AdCC may parallel that observed in
vitro in this study.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of a single cell line is a limitation of this study.
However, parallel data from in vitro and clinical samples suggest the possibility
that EMT is directly linked to CSCs and that Brachyury is a regulator of EMT and 
CSCs.

Cell differentiation agent-2 (CDA-2) is an extraction from healthy human urine
consisting of primary organic acids and peptides, and it has been demonstrated to
inhibit growth and induce differentiation in glioma and other cell lines. But the
mechanism of CDA-2 remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that CDA-2
inhibited cell growth and induced differentiation of glioma cells, accompanied
with decreased expression of SLUG, Twist and Vimentin in both SWO-38 and U251
cell lines. Overexpression of SLUG or Twist greatly eliminated the efficiency of 
CDA-2 in inducing differentiation. Further study showed that CDA-2 treatment
resulted in great changed microRNAs (miRNAs) detected by quantitative PCR, in
which miR-124 was one of the most changed miRNAs and its level was increased by
fourfold. The result of miRNA target prediction showed that miR-124 could
regulate hundreds of genes which were relative to cell differentiation, such as
SLUG, Vimentin, actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesion, tight junction. Inhibition of
miR-124 up-regulated SLUG, Twist and Vimentin proteins, and partly eliminated the
function of CDA-2 on these mesenchymal markers. Our findings demonstrated for the
first time that CDA-2 induced cell differentiation through suppressing Twist and 
SLUG via miR-124 in glioma cells.

The interrelationships among suture fusion, basicranial development, and
subsequent resynostosis in syndromic craniosynostosis have yet to be examined.
The objectives of this study were to determine the potential relationship between
suture fusion and cranial base development in a model of syndromic
craniosynostosis and to assess the effects of the syndrome on resynostosis
following suturectomy. To do this, posterior frontal and coronal suture fusion,
postnatal development of sphenooccipital synchondrosis, and resynostosis in
Twist1(+/+) (WT) and Twist1(+/-) litter-matched mice (a model for Saethre-Chotzen
syndrome) were quantified by evaluating µCT images with advanced image-processing
algorithms. The coronal suture in Twist(+/-) mice developed, fused, and
mineralized at a faster rate than that in normal littermates at postnatal days
6-30. Moreover, premature fusion of the coronal suture in Twist1(+/-) mice
preceded alterations in cranial base development. Analysis of synchondrosis
showed faster mineralization in Twist(+/-) mice at postnatal days 25-30. In a
rapid resynostosis model, there was an inability to fuse both the midline
posterior frontal suture and craniotomy defects in 21-day-old Twist(+/-) mice,
despite having accelerated mineralization in the posterior frontal suture and
defects. This study showed that dissimilarities between Twist1(+/+) and
Twist1(+/-) mice are not limited to a fused coronal suture but include
differences in fusion of other sutures, the regenerative capacity of the cranial 
vault, and the development of the cranial base.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition is an important mechanism of epithelial tumor
progression, local invasion and metastasis. The E-cadherin (CDH1) repressor SLUG 
(SNAI2) and the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor TWIST1 inhibit CDH1
expression in poorly differentiated malignancies as inducers of
epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition has been
implicated in progression from well to poorly differentiated/anaplastic thyroid
carcinoma but the expression of SNAI2 and TWIST1 proteins and their phenotypic
association in human thyroid cancers has not been extensively studied. We
examined the expression of SNAI2, TWIST1 and CDH1 by immunohistochemistry in a
panel of well-differentiated and anaplastic thyroid cancers and by qRT-PCR in
thyroid cell lines. Ten normal thyroids, 33 follicular adenomas, 56 papillary
thyroid carcinomas including 28 follicular variants, 27 follicular carcinomas and
10 anaplastic thyroid carcinomas were assembled on a tissue microarray and
immunostained for SNAI2, TWIST1 and CDH1. Most (8/10) anaplastic thyroid
carcinomas demonstrated strong nuclear immunoreactivity for SNAI2 with associated
absence of CDH1 in 6/8 cases (75%). TWIST1 was expressed in 5/10 anaplastic
thyroid carcinomas with absence of CDH1 in 3/5 (60%) cases. These findings were
confirmed in whole sections of all anaplastic thyroid carcinomas and in a
separate validation set of 10 additional anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. All
normal thyroids, follicular adenomas, papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas
were negative for SNAI2 and TWIST1 (P<0.0001) and all showed strong diffuse
immunoreactivity for CDH1 (P=0.026). Expression of SNAI2, TWIST1 and CDH1 mRNA
varied in a normal thyroid, papillary carcinoma and two anaplastic thyroid
carcinoma cell lines tested, but the highest levels of CDH1 mRNA were detected in
the normal thyroid cell line while the anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell line
demonstrated the highest levels of SNAI2 and TWIST1 mRNA. Our findings support
the role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the development of anaplastic
thyroid carcinoma.

TGF-ß promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and induces clusterin
(CLU) expression, linking these genes to cancer metastasis. CLU is a pleiotropic 
molecular chaperone that confers survival and proliferative advantage to cancer
cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which TGF-ß regulates CLU expression 
and CLU affects metastasis remain unknown. In this study, we report that the
transcription factor Twist1 mediates TGF-ß-induced CLU expression. By binding to 
E-boxes in the distal promoter region of CLU gene, Twist1 regulated basal and
TGF-ß-induced CLU transcription. In addition, CLU reduction reduced TGF-ß
induction of the mesenchymal markers, N-cadherin and fibronectin, thereby
inhibiting the migratory and invasive properties induced by TGF-ß. Targeted
inhibition of CLU also suppressed metastasis in an in vivo model. Taken together,
our findings indicate that CLU is an important mediator of TGF-ß-induced EMT, and
suggest that CLU suppression may represent a promising therapeutic option for
suppressing prostate cancer metastatic progression.

TWIST1 associates with NF-<U+03BA>B subunit RELA via carboxyl-terminal WR domain to
promote cell autonomous invasion through IL8 production.

BACKGROUND: Metastasis is the primary cause of death for cancer patients. TWIST1,
an evolutionarily conserved basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor,
is a strong promoter of metastatic spread and its expression is elevated in many 
advanced human carcinomas. However, the molecular events triggered by TWIST1 to
motivate dissemination of cancer cells are largely unknown.
RESULTS: Here we show that TWIST1 induces the production of interleukin 8 (IL8), 
which activates matrix metalloproteinases and promotes invasion of breast
epithelial and cancer cells. In this novel mechanism, TWIST1-mediated IL8
transcription is induced through the TWIST1 carboxy-terminal WR (Trp-Arg) domain 
instead of the classic DNA binding bHLH domain. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses
revealed that the WR domain mediates the formation of a protein complex comprised
of TWIST1 and the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-<U+03BA>B) subunit RELA (p65/NF-<U+03BA>B3), which 
synergistically activates the transcriptional activity of NF-<U+03BA>B. This activation 
leads to increased DNA binding affinity of RELA to the IL8 promoter and thus
induces the expression of the cytokine. Blockage of IL8 signaling by IL8
neutralizing antibodies or receptor inhibition reduced the invasiveness of both
breast epithelial and cancer cells, indicating that TWIST1 induces autonomous
cell invasion by establishing an IL8 antocrine loop.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the TWIST1 WR domain plays a critical role
in TWIST1-induced IL8 expression through interactions with and activation of
NF-<U+03BA>B. The produced IL8 signals through an autocrine loop and promotes
extracellular matrix degradation to enable cell invasion across the basement
membrane.

Cranial neural crest cells give rise to ectomesenchymal derivatives such as
cranial bones, cartilage, smooth muscle, dentin, as well as melanocytes, corneal 
endothelial cells, and neurons and glial cells of the peripheral nervous system. 
Previous studies have suggested that although multipotent stem-like cells may
exist during the course of cranial neural crest development, they are transient, 
undergoing lineage restriction early in embryonic development. We have developed 
culture conditions that allow cranial neural crest cells to be grown as
multipotent stem-like cells. With these methods, we obtained 2 independent cell
lines, O9-1 and i10-1, which were derived from mass cultures of Wnt1-Cre;
R26R-GFP-expressing cells. These cell lines can be propagated and passaged
indefinitely, and can differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, smooth muscle
cells, and glial cells. Whole-genome expression profiling of O9-1 cells revealed 
that this line stably expresses stem cell markers (CD44, Sca-1, and Bmi1) and
neural crest markers (AP-2a, Twist1, Sox9, Myc, Ets1, Dlx1, Dlx2, Crabp1, Epha2, 
and Itgb1). O9-1 cells are capable of contributing to cranial mesenchymal
(osteoblast and smooth muscle) neural crest fates when injected into E13.5 mouse 
cranial tissue explants and chicken embryos. These results suggest that O9-1
cells represent multipotent mesenchymal cranial neural crest cells. The O9-1 cell
line should serve as a useful tool for investigating the molecular properties of 
differentiating cranial neural crest cells.

Twist2 contributes to termination of limb bud outgrowth and patterning through
direct regulation of Grem1.

Twist1 has been demonstrated to play critical roles in the early development of
neural crest and mesodermally derived tissues including the limb. Twist2 has been
less well characterised but its relatively late onset of expression suggests
specific roles in the development of a number of organs. Expression of Twist2
within the developing limbs begins after formation of the limb bud and persists
within the peripheral mesenchyme until digital rays condense. We have used
RCAS-mediated overexpression in chick to investigate the function of Twist2 in
limb development. Viral misexpression following injection into the lateral plate 
mesoderm results in a spectrum of hypoplastic limb phenotypes. These include
generalized shortening of the entire limb, fusion of the autopod skeletal
elements, loss of individual digits or distal truncation resulting in complete
loss of the autopod. These phenotypes appear to result from a premature
termination of limb outgrowth and manifest as defective growth in both the
proximal-distal and anterior-posterior axes. In situ hybridisation analysis
demonstrates that many components of the Shh/Grem1/Fgf regulatory loop that
controls early limb growth and patterning are downregulated by Twist2
overexpression. Grem1 has a complementary expression pattern to Twist2 within the
limb primordia and co-expression of both Grem1 and Twist2 results in a rescue of 
the Twist2 overexpression phenotype. We demonstrate that Twist proteins directly 
repress Grem1 expression via a regulatory element downstream of the open reading 
frame. These data indicate that Twist2 regulates early limb morphogenesis through
a role in terminating the Shh/Grem1/Fgf autoregulatory loop.

OBJECTIVE: To test whether a noninvasive urine-based multianalyte diagnostic
readout assay that uses protein and DNA biomarkers can risk stratify patients
with hematuria into those who are or are not likely to have bladder cancer and
those who should receive standard care.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective, observational, multicenter,
single-assessment study was conducted between June 12, 2009, and April 15, 2011. 
Eligible patients presented with hematuria and as part of their evaluation
underwent cystoscopy. Urine samples were analyzed for the presence of mutant
FGFR3 and quantified matrix metalloproteinase 2 and the hypermethylation of
TWIST1 and NID2. A patient's chance of having (positive predictive value [PPV])
or not having (negative predictive value [NPV]) cancer was determined by FGFR3
alone or by all 4 biomarkers, respectively.
RESULTS: Cystoscopy/biopsy diagnosed 690 of 748 patients as negative and 58 as
positive for bladder cancer. Of 21 patients identified by FGFR3 as highly likely 
to have cancer, 20 were also positive by cystoscopy/biopsy, resulting in a PPV of
95.2% (20 of 21), with specificity of 99.9% (689 of 690). The 4-marker
combination identified 395 patients as having a low likelihood of cancer. Of
these, 56.2% (388 of 690) also had negative biopsy/cystoscopy findings, resulting
in an NPV of 98.2% (388 of 395). In total, 416 of the 748 patients with hematuria
(55.6%) were identified with extremely high NPV and PPV to have or not have
bladder cancer.
CONCLUSION: This multianalyte assay accurately stratified patients with high
confidence into those who likely do or do not have bladder cancer. This test was 
developed to enhance and not to eliminate referrals for urologic evaluation.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this paper was to elucidate the potential methylation 
levels of adjacent normal and cancer tissues by comparing them with normal
colorectal tissues, and to describe the correlations between the methylation and 
clinical parameters in Korean colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.
METHODS: Hypermethylation profiles of nine genes (RASSF1, APC, p16(INK4a),
Twist1, E-cadherin, TIMP3, Smad4, COX2, and ABCB1) were examined with 100 sets of
cancer tissues and 14 normal colorectal tissues. We determined the
hypermethylation at a given level by a percent of methylation ratio value of 10
using quantitative methylation real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Nine genes' hypermethylation levels in Korean CRC patient tissues were
increased more higher than normal colorectal tissues. However, the amounts of
p16(INK4a) and E-cadherin gene hypermethylation in normal and CRC tissues were
not significantly different nor did TIMP3 gene hypermethylation in adjacent
normal and cancer tissues differ significantly. The hypermethylation of TIMP3,
E-cadherin, ABCB1, and COX2 genes among other genes were abundantly found in
normal colorectal tissues. The hypermethylation of nine genes' methylation in
cancer tissues was not significantly associated with any clinical parameters. In 
Cohen's kappa test, it was moderately observed that RASSF1 was related with
E-cadherin, and Smad4 with ABCB1 and COX2.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for different hypermethylation patterns
of cancer-associated genes in normal and CRC tissues, which may serve as useful
information on CRC cancer progression.

Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is a malignant epithelium neoplasm that originates from
the bile epithelium and for which there are few therapeutic strategies. The mTOR 
pathway involved in many cellular processes was reported to be up-regulated in
various cancers. We investigated the activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway in CC
cell lines with different degrees of dedifferentiation and found that rapamycin
could suppress the motility and the peritoneal dissemination of sarcomatoid SCK
cells. Inhibition of the mTOR pathway with rapamycin decreased significantly the 
number of tumor nodules and prolonged the survival rates of nude mice inoculated 
with sarcomatoid CC cells. Prolonged treatments with rapamycin were found to
disrupt the mTORC2 assembly and to reduce the phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser
727. Rapamycin decreased both mRNA and protein levels of MMP2 and Twist1, which
are regulated by STAT3 and associated with cancer metastasis. The overexpression 
of STAT3 S727A lacking the phosphorylation site resulted in significantly less
sensitivity to rapamycin than the overexpression of STAT3 WT. Taken together, our
results suggest that rapamycin could suppress the motility of sarcomatoid CC by
down-regulating p-STAT3 (S727) through the impairment of mTORC2 assembly.

implications.

BACKGROUND: Non syndromic craniosynostoses are the most frequent craniofacial
malformations worldwide. They represent a wide and heterogeneous group of
entities, in which the dysmorphism may occur in a single (simple forms) or in
multiple sutures (complex forms). Simple forms present a higher birth prevalence 
and are classified according to the involved suture and to the corresponding
abnormal cranial shape: scaphocephaly (SC; sagittal suture), trigonocephaly (TC; 
metopic suture), anterior plagiocephaly (unilateral coronal suture), posterior
plagiocephaly (unilateral lambdoid suture). They occur commonly as sporadic
forms, although a familiar recurrence is sometimes observed, suggesting a
mendelian inheritance. The genetic causes of simple craniosynostosis are still
largely unknown, as mutations in common craniosynostosis-associated genes and
structural chromosomal aberrations have been rarely found in these cases.
AIMS: This review is intended to dissect comprehensively the state-of-the art on 
the genetic etiology of single suture craniosynostoses, in the attempt to
categorize all known disease-associated genes and chromosomal aberrations.
Possible genotype/phenotype correlations are discussed as useful clues towards
the definition of optimized clinical management flowcharts.

Twist, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, and E-cadherin are both
correlated with the metastatic progression of several types of cancer. However,
it is currently unknown whether their activations have relevance to the
progression of osteosarcoma. The purpose of the present study was to investigate 
the clinicopathological and prognostic value of Twist and E-cadherin in
osteosarcoma. Twist and E-cadherin expressions were determined by
immunohistochemistry. Patient survival rates were determined by Kaplan-Meier
method and log-rank test. Cox regression was adopted for multivariate analysis of
prognostic factors. The positive rates of Twist and E-cadherin in 107
osteosarcoma specimens were 31.8 % (34/107) and 20.6 % (22/107), respectively.
Twist expression was significantly correlated with that of E-cadherin (r =
-0.209, P = 0.031). The positive expression of Twist and E-cadherin was
significantly associated with metastasis in 107 osteosarcoma specimens (both P < 
0.05). Patients with positive Twist expression had significantly poorer overall
survival (OS; P < 0.05) and disease-free survival (DFS, P < 0.05) when compared
with patients with the negative expression of Twist. Patients with positive
expression of E-cadherin had significantly poorer OS (P < 0.05) when compared
with patients with negative E-cadherin expression, but not a significantly poorer
DFS (P = 0.081). On multivariate analysis, Twist expression and age were found to
be independent prognostic factors for OS (both P < 0.05) and DFS (both P < 0.05).
Our results suggest that Twist was expressed significantly more and E-cadherin
significantly less in osteosarcoma with metastasis, and expression of both might 
be related to the prediction of metastasis potency and poor prognosis for
patients with osteosarcoma.

Computational modeling of the bHLH domain of the transcription factor TWIST1 and 
R118C, S144R and K145E mutants.

Centro, Rio de Janeiro/RJ, Brasil.

BACKGROUND: Human TWIST1 is a highly conserved member of the regulatory basic
helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors. TWIST1 forms homo- or heterodimers
with E-box proteins, such as E2A (isoforms E12 and E47), MYOD and HAND2.
Haploinsufficiency germ-line mutations of the twist1 gene in humans are the main 
cause of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS), which is characterized by limb
abnormalities and premature fusion of cranial sutures. Because of the importance 
of TWIST1 in the regulation of embryonic development and its relationship with
SCS, along with the lack of an experimentally solved 3D structure, we performed
comparative modeling for the TWIST1 bHLH region arranged into wild-type
homodimers and heterodimers with E47. In addition, three mutations that promote
DNA binding failure (R118C, S144R and K145E) were studied on the TWIST1 monomer. 
We also explored the behavior of the mutant forms in aqueous solution using
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, focusing on the structural changes of the
wild-type versus mutant dimers.
RESULTS: The solvent-accessible surface area of the homodimers was smaller on
wild-type dimers, which indicates that the cleft between the monomers remained
more open on the mutant homodimers. RMSD and RMSF analyses indicated that mutated
dimers presented values that were higher than those for the wild-type dimers. For
a more careful investigation, the monomer was subdivided into four regions:
basic, helix I, loop and helix II. The basic domain presented a higher
flexibility in all of the parameters that were analyzed, and the mutant dimer
basic domains presented values that were higher than the wild-type dimers. The
essential dynamic analysis also indicated a higher collective motion for the
basic domain.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the mutations studied turned the dimers into
more unstable structures with a wider cleft, which may be a reason for the loss
of DNA binding capacity observed for in vitro circumstances.

Evidence for the dysregulated expression of TWIST1, TGFß1 and SMAD3 in
differentiating osteoblasts from primary hip osteoarthritis patients.

of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia 5005, Australia.

OBJECTIVE: This study compared human primary osteoblasts derived from hip
osteoarthritis (OA) cases against controls (CTLs) to investigate candidate OA
disease genes, twist homologue 1 (TWIST1), wingless MMTV integration site family 
member 5B (WNT5B), transforming growth factor-ß (TGFß1) and SMAD family member 3 
(SMAD3), during osteoblast differentiation, relative to calcium apposition and
elemental mineral composition.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Primary osteoblast cultures were generated from
intertrochanteric trabecular bone samples from five female primary hip OA cases
and five age-matched female CTLs. During a 42-day differentiation time-course,
alizarin red stains, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and real-time
RT-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to quantify calcium, elemental
composition and gene expression, respectively. Data were analysed using linear
mixed effects models and Pearson correlation matrices.
RESULTS: Significant differences, correlations and associations were found in OA 
and CTL osteoblasts between gene and mineral measures. The calcium: phosphorous
(Ca:P) ratio was significantly more varied in OA compared to CTL. Calcium
apposition, mineral composition as well as TWIST1 and TGFß1 mRNA expression
changed significantly over time. TWIST1 mRNA expression was elevated and
correlated with SMAD3 mRNA levels in the OA cohort during the time-course.
Associations were observed between tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase
(TNAP), osteocalcin (OCN), TWIST1, TGFß1, SMAD3 mRNA levels and mineral measures 
in OA against CTL. Temporal differences between SMAD3 mRNA expression and mineral
composition were also found in OA.
CONCLUSIONS: Dysregulated expression of TWIST1, TGFß1 and SMAD3 mRNA observed in 
OA bone is reflected in the functionality of the osteoblast when these cells are 
cultured ex vivo. The results presented here are consistent with at least part of
the aetiology of primary hip OA deriving from altered intrinsic properties of the
osteoblast.

mouse.

Malformations of the cardiovascular system are the most common type of birth
defect in humans, frequently affecting the formation of valves and septa. During 
heart valve and septa formation, cells from the atrio-ventricular canal (AVC) and
outflow tract (OFT) regions of the heart undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transformation (EMT) and invade the underlying extracellular matrix to give rise 
to endocardial cushions. Subsequent maturation of newly formed mesenchyme cells
leads to thin stress-resistant leaflets. TWIST1 is a basic helix-loop-helix
transcription factor expressed in newly formed mesenchyme cells of the AVC and
OFT that has been shown to play roles in cell survival, cell proliferation and
differentiation. However, the downstream targets of TWIST1 during heart valve
formation remain unclear. To identify genes important for heart valve development
downstream of TWIST1, we performed global gene expression profiling of AVC, OFT, 
atria and ventricles of the embryonic day 10.5 mouse heart by tag-sequencing
(Tag-seq). Using this resource we identified a novel set of 939 genes, including 
123 regulators of transcription, enriched in the valve forming regions of the
heart. We compared these genes to a Tag-seq library from the Twist1 null
developing valves revealing significant gene expression changes. These changes
were consistent with a role of TWIST1 in controlling differentiation of
mesenchymal cells following their transformation from endothelium in the mouse.
To study the role of TWIST1 at the DNA level we performed chromatin
immunoprecipitation and identified novel direct targets of TWIST1 in the
developing heart valves. Our findings support a role for TWIST1 in the
differentiation of AVC mesenchyme post-EMT in the mouse, and suggest that TWIST1 
can exert its function by direct DNA binding to activate valve specific gene
expression.

epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasive properties of prostate cancer.

Epigenetic deregulation of gene expression has a role in the initiation and
progression of prostate cancer (PCa). The histone methyltransferase MMSET/WHSC1
(Multiple Myeloma SET domain) is overexpressed in a number of metastatic tumors, 
but its mechanism of action has not been defined. In this work, we found that PCa
cell lines expressed significantly higher levels of MMSET compared with
immortalized, non-transformed prostate cells. Knockdown experiments showed that, 
in metastatic PCa cell lines, dimethylation of lysine 36 and trimethylation of
lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K36me2 and H3K27me3, respectively) depended on MMSET
expression, whereas depletion of MMSET in benign prostatic cells did not affect
chromatin modifications. Knockdown of MMSET in DU145 and PC-3 tumor cells
decreased cell proliferation, colony formation in soft agar and strikingly
diminished cell migration and invasion. Conversely, overexpression of MMSET in
immortalized, non-transformed RWPE-1 cells promoted cell migration and invasion, 
accompanied by an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Among a panel of
EMT-promoting genes analyzed, TWIST1 expression was strongly activated in
response to MMSET. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that MMSET
binds to the TWIST1 locus and leads to an increase in H3K36me2, suggesting a
direct role of MMSET in the regulation of this gene. Depletion of TWIST1 in
MMSET-overexpressing RWPE-1 cells blocked cell invasion and EMT, indicating that 
TWIST1 was a critical target of MMSET, responsible for the acquisition of an
invasive phenotype. Collectively, these data suggest that MMSET has a role in PCa
pathogenesis and progression through epigenetic regulation of metastasis-related 
genes.

NSC 74859 enhances doxorubicin cytotoxicity via inhibition of
epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.

Doxorubicin-based therapy is not effective for the treatment of hepatocellular
carcinomas (HCCs), which often undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
during tumor progression. Activation of signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT3) is associated with chemosensitivity and may contribute to
EMT during HCC chemotherapy. Low doses of NSC 78459 (a novel STAT3 inhibitor)
have little effect on HCC cell proliferation, but efficiently inhibit STAT3.
HuH-7, Hep3B, and HepG2 cells, with epithelial phenotypes, show significantly
enhanced doxorubicin cytotoxicity following co-treatment with NSC 74859, whereas 
mesenchymal SNU-449 cells show no such enhancement. NSC 74859 inhibits STAT3
activity and suppressed doxorubicin-induced EMT in epithelial HCC cells.
siRNA-mediated STAT3 knockdown resulted in EMT inhibition, which led to
attenuation of NSC 74859-mediated chemosensitivity. Our data indicate NSC 74859
co-administration enhances doxorubicin cytotoxicity by inhibiting STAT3 in
epithelial HCC cells. STAT3 deactivation and associated EMT attenuation
contribute to the synergistic anti-tumor effects of combined NSC
74859/doxorubicin therapy.

diagnostically useful markers.

The molecules Indian hedgehog (IHH), SP7 (also known as osterix), sex-determining
region Y-box 9 (SOX9), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and TWIST1
regulate the normal differentiation of osteo- and chondrogenic cells from
precursors during skeletal development and remodeling. The aberrant function of
the same molecules has been implicated in the pathogenesis of bone tumors.
Preliminary studies suggest that antibodies against these molecules have
practical, diagnostic or prognostic utility in tumors. However, a comprehensive
analysis of the expression of these molecules in a large, diverse set of bone
tumors has yet to be reported. The goals of this study were to compare the
immunohistochemical profiles of IHH, SP7, SOX9, RUNX2 and TWIST1 among bone
tumors and to determine the optimum panel for diagnostic utility. Tissue
microarrays prepared from 206 undecalcified tumors (71 osteosarcomas, 26
osteoblastomas/osteoid osteomas, 50 giant cell tumors, 5 chondromyxoid fibromas
and 54 chondroblastomas) were stained with antibodies to IHH, SP7, SOX9, RUNX2
and TWIST1. The stains were scored for intensity (0-3+) and distribution. The
results were analyzed by cluster analysis. Optimum antibody panels for diagnostic
sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Analysis revealed six main clusters 
that corresponded well to tumor types and suggested a close relationship between 
the stromal cells of giant cell tumor and the osteoblasts of osteosarcoma. The
expression profile of chondromyxoid fibroma and chondroblastoma also suggested
related differentiation. The distribution of osteoblastomas and osteoid osteomas 
was more heterogeneous. RUNX2, SOX9 and TWIST1 represented the most sensitive and
specific immunohistochemical panel to distinguish among these diagnoses with the 
limitation that no result could discriminate between chondroblastoma and
chondromyxoid fibroma. IHH and SP7 did not yield additional utility.

Aberrant activation of the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway is common in human
cervical cancers. However, the mechanisms of Wnt activation in cervical cancer
remain largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that Klotho, a Wnt
antagonist, is downregulated in invasive human cervical tumors and in a cell line
we analyzed. Our data demonstrated that in vivo Klotho expression was not
observed in invasive cervical carcinoma. In vitro restoration of Klotho
expression in SiHa cells resulted in a decreased cell motility and invasiveness
through upregulation of E-cadherin, downregulation of N-cadherin and reduced
expression of MMP7 and -9. Ectopic expression of Klotho also reduced the
expression of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription
factors Slug and Twist. Furthermore, Klotho causes a significant inhibition of
the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway in cervical cancer cells, as supported by the
expression of Wnt/ß-catenin transcriptional target genes such as c-Myc and
cyclin D1. Consequently, our findings demonstrate for the first time that Klotho 
regulates tumor invasion through the EMT process and provide novel mechanistic
insights into the role of Klotho in cervical cancer progression and contribute to
treatment for metastatic cervical cancer patients.

Twist1 regulates Ifng expression in Th1 cells by interfering with Runx3 function.

A transcription factor network that includes STAT4, T-bet, and Runx3 promotes the
differentiation of Th1 cells and inflammatory immune responses. How additional
transcription factors regulate the function of Th1 cells has not been defined. In
this study we show that the negative regulatory factor Twist1 decreases
expression of T-bet, Runx3, and IL-12Rß2 as it inhibits IFN-<U+03B3> production. Ectopic
expression of Runx3, but not T-bet or IL-12Rß2, compensates for the effects of
Twist1 on IFN-<U+03B3> production, and Twist1 regulation of Ifng depends on complex
formation with Runx3. Twist1 decreases Runx3 and T-bet binding at the Ifng locus,
and it decreases chromatin looping within the Ifng locus. These data define an
IL-12/STAT4-induced negative regulatory loop that impacts multiple components of 
the Th1 transcriptional network and provide further insight into regulation of
Th1 differentiation.

Conversion of stationary to invasive tumor initiating cells (TICs): role of

Emerging evidence has implicated the role of tumor initiating cells (TICs) in the
process of cancer metastasis. The mechanism underlying the conversion of TICs
from stationary to invasive remains to be characterized. In this report, we
employed less invasive breast cancer TICs, SK-3rd, that displays
CD44(high)/CD24(low) with high mammosphere-forming and tumorigenic capacities, to
investigate the mechanism by which stationary TICs are converted to invasive
TICs. Invasive ability of SK-3rd TICs was markedly enhanced when the cells were
cultured under hypoxic conditions. Given the role of membrane type 1-matrix
metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) in cancer invasion/metastasis, we explored a possible
involvement of MT1-MMP in hypoxia-induced TIC invasion. Silencing of MT1-MMP by a
shRNA approach resulted in diminution of hypoxia-induced cell invasion in vitro
and metastasis in vivo. Under hypoxic conditions, MT1-MMP redistributed from
cytoplasmic storage pools to the cell surface of TICs, which coincides with the
increased cell invasion. In addition, CD44, a cancer stem-like cell marker,
inversely correlated with increased cell surface MT1-MMP. Interestingly, cell
surface MT1-MMP gradually disappeared when the hypoxia-treated cells were
switched to normoxia, suggesting the plasticity of TICs in response to oxygen
content. Furthermore, we dissected the pathways leading to upregulated MT1-MMP in
cytoplasmic storage pools under normoxic conditions, by demonstrating a cascade
involving Twist1-miR10b-HoxD10 leading to enhanced MT1-MMP expression in SK-3rd
TICs. These observations suggest that MT1-MMP is a key molecule capable of
executing conversion of stationary TICs to invasive TICs under hypoxic conditions
and thereby controlling metastasis.

Twist1 is highly expressed in primary and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), and thus acts as a critical target for lung cancer chemotherapy. In the 
current study, we investigated the underlying mechanism initiated by silencing of
Twist1 that sensitizes NSCLC cells to cisplatin. Silencing of Twist1 triggered
ATP depletion, leading to AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-activated mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition in NSCLC cells. AMPK-induced mTOR
inhibition, in turn, resulted in downregulation of ribosome protein S6 kinase 1
(S6K1) activity. Downregulation of mTOR/S6K1 reduced Mcl-1 protein expression,
consequently promoting sensitization to cisplatin. Overexpression of Mcl-1
reduced PARP cleavage induced by cisplatin and Twist1 siRNA, suggesting that this
sensitization is controlled through Mcl-1 expression. Interestingly, cells
treated with Twist1 siRNA displayed upregulation of p21(Waf1/CIP1), and
suppression of p21(Waf1/CIP1) with specific siRNA further enhanced the cell death
response to cisplatin/Twist1 siRNA. In conclusion, silencing of Twist1 sensitizes
lung cancer cells to cisplatin via stimulating AMPK-induced mTOR inhibition,
leading to a reduction in Mcl-1 protein. To our knowledge, this is the first
report to provide a rationale for the implication of cross-linking between Twist1
and mTOR signaling in resistance of NSCLC to anticancer drugs.

Twist1 causes the transcriptional repression of claudin-4 with prognostic
significance in esophageal cancer.

Twist1 is a transcription factor that is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal
transition by suppressing intercellular adhesion. In this study, we aimed to
determine the role of Twist1 in the regulation of claudin-4 expression and
investigate its specific mechanisms and clinical implications using human
esophageal carcinoma cell lines and tissues. As a result, up-regulation of Twist1
decreased both gene and protein expression levels of endogenous claudin-4 and the
suppression was mediated by direct binding of Twist1 to the canonical E-box in
the promoter region of claudin-4. In addition, there was a significant inverse
correlation of claudin-4 with Twist1 in esophageal cancer tissues. High Twist1
and low claudin-4 expression was associated with the poorest prognosis and was
more highly correlated with adverse outcome than any other subgroup with
statistical significance (p=0.001). Our results indicate that Twist1 induces the 
repression of claudin-4 expression during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
in esophageal carcinoma.

Mesodermal expression of Fgfr2S252W is necessary and sufficient to induce
craniosynostosis in a mouse model of Apert syndrome.

Coordinated growth of the skull and brain are vital to normal human development. 
Craniosynostosis, the premature fusion of the calvarial bones of the skull, is a 
relatively common pediatric disease, occurring in 1 in 2500 births, and requires 
significant surgical management, especially in syndromic cases. Syndromic
craniosynostosis is caused by a variety of genetic lesions, most commonly by
activating mutations of FGFRs 1-3, and inactivating mutations of TWIST1. In a
mouse model of TWIST1 haploinsufficiency, cell mixing between the neural
crest-derived frontal bone and mesoderm-derived parietal bone accompanies coronal
suture fusion during embryonic development. However, the relevance of lineage
mixing in craniosynostosis induced by activating FGFR mutations is unknown. Here,
we demonstrate a novel mechanism of suture fusion in the Apert Fgfr2(S252W) mouse
model. Using Cre/lox recombination we simultaneously induce expression of
Fgfr2(S252W) and ß-galactosidase in either the neural crest or mesoderm of the
skull. We show that mutation of the mesoderm alone is necessary and sufficient to
cause craniosynostosis, while mutation of the neural crest is neither. The
lineage border is not disrupted by aberrant cell migration during fusion.
Instead, the suture mesenchyme itself remains intact and is induced to undergo
osteogenesis. We eliminate postulated roles for dura mater or skull base changes 
in craniosynostosis. The viability of conditionally mutant mice also allows
post-natal assessment of other aspects of Apert syndrome.

EMT and stem cell-like properties associated with HIF-2a are involved in
arsenite-induced transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells.

BACKGROUND: Arsenic is well-established as a human carcinogen, but the molecular 
mechanisms leading to arsenic-induced carcinogenesis are complex and elusive. It 
is not been determined if the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stem
cell-like properties contribute in causing to carcinogen-induced malignant
transformation and subsequent tumor formation.
METHODS: To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying EMT and the emergence
of cancer stem cell-like properties during neoplastic transformation of human
bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells induced by chronic exposure to arsenite. HBE
cells were continuously exposed to arsenite. Spheroid formation assays and
analyses of side populations (SPs) were performed to confirm that arsenite
induces the acquired EMT and cancer stem cell-like phenotype. Treated HBE cells
were molecularly characterized by RT-PCR, Western blots, immunofluorescence,
Southwestern assays, reporter assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation.
RESULTS: With chronic exposure to arsenite, HBE cells undergo an EMT and then
acquire a malignant cancer stem cell-like phenotype. Twist1 and Bmi1 are involved
in arsenite-induced EMT. The process is directly regulated by HIF-2a. The
self-renewal genes, Oct4, Bmi1, and ALDH1, are necessary for arsenite-mediated
maintenance of stem cells.
CONCLUSIONS: EMT, regulated by HIF-2a, and the development of a cancer stem
cell-like phenotype are associated with arsenite-induced transformation of HBE
cells.

KRAS mutant lung cancers are generally refractory to chemotherapy as well
targeted agents. To date, the identification of drugs to therapeutically inhibit 
K-RAS have been unsuccessful, suggesting that other approaches are required. We
demonstrate in both a novel transgenic mutant Kras lung cancer mouse model and in
human lung tumors that the inhibition of Twist1 restores a senescence program
inducing the loss of a neoplastic phenotype. The Twist1 gene encodes for a
transcription factor that is essential during embryogenesis. Twist1 has been
suggested to play an important role during tumor progression. However, there is
no in vivo evidence that Twist1 plays a role in autochthonous tumorigenesis.
Through two novel transgenic mouse models, we show that Twist1 cooperates with
Kras(G12D) to markedly accelerate lung tumorigenesis by abrogating cellular
senescence programs and promoting the progression from benign adenomas to
adenocarcinomas. Moreover, the suppression of Twist1 to physiological levels is
sufficient to cause Kras mutant lung tumors to undergo senescence and lose their 
neoplastic features. Finally, we analyzed more than 500 human tumors to
demonstrate that TWIST1 is frequently overexpressed in primary human lung tumors.
The suppression of TWIST1 in human lung cancer cells also induced cellular
senescence. Hence, TWIST1 is a critical regulator of cellular senescence
programs, and the suppression of TWIST1 in human tumors may be an effective
example of pro-senescence therapy.

Runx2/Cbfa1 is a member of the Runt-related transcription factor family and is an
essential regulator of osteoblast/chondrocyte differentiation. Recently, aberrant
expression of Runx2 and its oncogenic functions have been identified in the
progression and metastasis of human cancers. In this study, we investigated the
expression profile of Runx family genes in normal thyroid tissue, non-neoplastic 
but abnormal thyroid tissue, various types of thyroid tumors and representative
human thyroid carcinoma cell lines. Using reverse transcriptase-PCR and western
blotting, we found that Runx2 was consistently upregulated in papillary
carcinomas (PCs) and thyroid carcinoma cell lines compared with normal thyroid
tissue. With immunohistochemistry, we observed negative or focal immunoreactivity
of Runx2 in the nuclei of normal thyroid follicular cells. None of the
non-neoplastic thyroid tissues, including Graves' thyroid and adenomatous goiter,
had diffuse positivity of Runx2. Expression of Runx2 in benign follicular
adenomas varied from negative to diffusely positive. Meanwhile, all malignant
thyroid tumors showed some Runx2 immunopositivity. It was diffuse and intense in 
83% (19/23) of PCs, 71% (5/7) of follicular carcinomas (FCs) and 40% (4/10) of
undifferentiated carcinomas (UCs). In thyroid carcinoma cell lines, the MEK
inhibitor U0126 suppressed Runx2, suggesting an association of the MAPK/ERK
pathway with Runx2 regulation. Effective silencing of Runx2 by short interfering 
RNA (siRNA) demonstrated downregulation of EMT-related molecules (SNAI2, SNAI3
and TWIST1), MMP2 and vasculogenic factors (VEGFA and VEGFC) in thyroid carcinoma
cells. We also confirmed that Runx2 silencing suppresses thyroid carcinoma cell
invasion in transwell assays. In conclusion, this study provides insight into the
potential molecular mechanism of thyroid cancer invasion. Our data suggest that
enhanced Runx2 is functionally linked to tumor invasion and metastasis of thyroid
carcinoma by regulating EMT-related molecules, matrix metalloproteinases and
angiogenic/lymphangiogenic factors.

BACKGROUND: To investigate the prognostic significance of disseminated tumor
cells (DTCs) in bone marrow (BM) from non-metastatic breast cancer patients
before and after surgery.
METHODS: Patients with non-metastatic breast cancer were consecutively recruited 
to this project during the years 1998-2000. Real-time RT-PCR quantification of a 
DTC multimarker panel consisting of cytokeratin 19, mammaglobin A and TWIST1 mRNA
was performed in BM samples obtained from 154 patients three weeks (BM2) and/or
six months after surgery (BM3). The results were compared to previously published
data from pre-operative BM analyses for the same patients.
RESULTS: DTCs were identified in post-operative BM samples (BM2 and/or BM3) from 
23 (15%) of the 154 patients investigated. During a median follow-up of
98<U+2009>months, 10 (44%) of these patients experienced systemic relapse as compared to
16 (12%) of 131 DTC-negative patients. Kaplan-Meier estimates of systemic
recurrence-free- and breast-cancer specific survival demonstrated significantly
shorter survival for patients with persistent DTCs in BM after surgery (p=0.001).
By multivariate Cox regression analyses, persistent DTCs after surgery was an
independent predictor of both systemic recurrence-free- (HR<U+2009>=<U+2009>5.4, p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) and
breast-cancer specific survival (HR<U+2009>=<U+2009>5.3, p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). Furthermore, the
prognostic value of DTCs in BM was similar for pre- and post surgery samples.
However, patients with DTCs both before and after surgery (BM1 and BM2/3) had a
particularly poor prognosis (systemic recurrence-free survival: HR<U+2009>=<U+2009>7.2,
p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001 and breast-cancer specific survival: HR<U+2009>=<U+2009>8.0, p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Detection of persistent DTCs in BM samples obtained after surgery
identified non-metastatic breast cancer patients at high risk for systemic
relapse, and with reduced breast-cancer specific survival. Furthermore, patients 
with positive DTC status both before and after surgery had a particularly poor
prognosis.

asymmetry, ptosis, brachydactyly, significant learning difficulties, recurrent
scalp infections with marked hair loss, and elevated serum immunoglobulin E.
Standard lymphocyte karyotype showed a small additional segment in
7p21[46,XX,add(7)(p21)]. Deletion of the TWIST1 gene, detected by Multiplex
Ligation Probe-dependent Amplification (MPLA) and array-CGH, was consistent with 
phenotype of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Array CGH also showed deletion of four
other genes at 7p21.1 (SNX13, PRPS1L1, HD9C9, and FERD3L) and the deletion of six
genes (CACNA2D2, C3orf18, HEMK1, CISH, MAPKAPK3, and DOCK3) at 3p21.31. Our case 
reinforces FERD3L as candidate gene for intellectual disability and suggested
that genes located in 3p21.3 can be related to hyper IgE phenotype.

PURPOSE: Although most prostate cancers regress after androgen deprivation
therapy is given at diagnosis, they eventually regrow in a castration resistant
manner, spread systemically and end fatally. Thus, novel therapeutic compounds
are needed for prostate cancer. We previously reported that methylation at
histone H3 lysine 9 was increased in prostate cancer. In this study we examined
the effects of the methyltransferase inhibitor adenosine dialdehyde (Sigma®) on
the methylation state of histone H3 lysine 9 and AR gene expression as well as
its possible usefulness for prostate cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of adenosine dialdehyde on the methylation
state of histone H3 lysine 9 and AR gene expression was examined by quantitative 
real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. We compared methylation at 
histone H3 lysine 9 at the AR promoter region between androgen dependent and
castration resistant prostate cancer by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The 
cytotoxic effect of adenosine dialdehyde on prostate cancer was also evaluated in
vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: Adenosine dialdehyde suppressed the monomethylation and dimethylation of
histone H3 lysine 9 and inhibited Twist1 as well as androgen receptor expression,
which are critical for the survival and growth of androgen dependent, androgen
sensitive and castration resistant prostate cancer cells in which monomethylated 
histone H3 lysine 9 increased at the 5' untranslated region of the AR gene. As a 
result, adenosine dialdehyde had a cytotoxic effect on androgen dependent,
androgen sensitive and castration resistant prostate cancer cells in vitro.
Adenosine dialdehyde also suppressed prostate cancer growth in vivo in a mouse
xenograft model.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the methyltransferase inhibitor adenosine
dialdehyde is a promising, novel therapeutic compound for prostate cancer.

Bmps and id2a act upstream of Twist1 to restrict ectomesenchyme potential of the 
cranial neural crest.

Das A(1), Crump JG.

Author information: 
(1)Broad CIRM Center, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, 
Los Angeles, California, United States of America.

Cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) have the remarkable capacity to generate both 
the non-ectomesenchyme derivatives of the peripheral nervous system and the
ectomesenchyme precursors of the vertebrate head skeleton, yet how these
divergent lineages are specified is not well understood. Whereas studies in mouse
have indicated that the Twist1 transcription factor is important for
ectomesenchyme development, its role and regulation during CNCC lineage decisions
have remained unclear. Here we show that two Twist1 genes play an essential role 
in promoting ectomesenchyme at the expense of non-ectomesenchyme gene expression 
in zebrafish. Twist1 does so by promoting Fgf signaling, as well as potentially
directly activating fli1a expression through a conserved ectomesenchyme-specific 
enhancer. We also show that Id2a restricts Twist1 activity to the ectomesenchyme 
lineage, with Bmp activity preferentially inducing id2a expression in
non-ectomesenchyme precursors. We therefore propose that the ventral migration of
CNCCs away from a source of Bmps in the dorsal ectoderm promotes ectomesenchyme
development by relieving Id2a-dependent repression of Twist1 function. Together
our model shows how the integration of Bmp inhibition at its origin and Fgf
activation along its migratory route would confer temporal and spatial
specificity to the generation of ectomesenchyme from the neural crest.

Metastatic breast tumor cells display an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 
that increases cell motility, invasion, and dissemination. Although the
transcription factor Twist1 has been shown to contribute to EMT and cancer
metastasis, the signaling pathways regulating Twist1 activity are poorly
understood. Here, we show that Twist1 is ubiquitously phosphorylated in 90% of
1,532 invasive human breast tumors. Akt/protein kinase B (PKB)-mediated Twist1
phosphorylation promotes EMT and breast cancer metastasis by modulating its
transcriptional target TGF-ß2, leading to enhanced TGF-ß receptor signaling,
which in turn maintains hyperactive phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
signaling. Preventing phosphorylation of Twist1, as well as depletion of TGF-ß2, 
significantly impaired the metastatic potential of cancer cells in vivo,
indicating a key role of phosphorylated Twist1 (phospho-Twist1) in mediating
cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and TGF-ß/Smad signaling axes that supports
metastatic tumor development. Our results describe a novel signaling event
linking PI3K/Akt hyperactivation in tumor cells to direct regulation of Twist1
activation and tumor metastasis.SIGNIFICANCE: We identified the first
phospho-Twist1 transcriptional target TGF-ß2, which mediates cross-talk between
PI3K/Akt and TGF-ß signaling and promotes tumor metastasis. Our results thus
illustrate a direct role of PI3K/Akt signaling in metastatic cancer development
and suggest that Twist1 phosphorylation could be a potential therapeutic target
in clinical cancer treatment.

progression.

Gastric carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies and a lethal cancer in
the world. Notch signaling and transcription factors STAT3 (signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3) and Twist regulate tumor development and are
critical regulators of gastric cancer progression. Herein, the relationship among
Notch, STAT3 and Twist pathways in the control of gastric cancer progression was 
studied. We found that Twist and phosphorylated STAT3 levels were promoted by the
activated Notch1 receptor in human stomach adenocarcinoma SC-M1, embryonic kidney
HEK293 and erythroleukemia K562 cells. Notch1 signaling dramatically induced
Twist promoter activity through a C promoter binding factor-1-independent manner 
and STAT3 phosphorylation. Overexpression of Notch1 receptor intracellular domain
(N1IC) enhanced the interaction between nuclear STAT3 and Twist promoter in
cells. Gastric cancer progression of SC-M1 cells was promoted by N1IC through
STAT3 phosphorylation and Twist expression including colony formation, migration 
and invasion. STAT3 regulated gastric cancer progression of SC-M1 cells via
Twist. N1IC also elevated the progression of other gastric cancer cells such as
AGS and KATO III cells through STAT3 and Twist. The N1IC-promoted tumor growth
and lung metastasis of SC-M1 cells in mice were suppressed by the STAT3 inhibitor
JSI-124 and Twist knockdown. Furthermore, Notch1 and Notch ligand Jagged1
expressions were significantly associated with phosphorylated STAT3 and Twist
levels in gastric cancer tissues of patients. Taken together, these results
suggest that Notch1/STAT3/Twist signaling axis is involved in progression of
human gastric cancer and modulation of this cascade has potential for the
targeted combination therapy.

This study aimed to investigate the expression of Twist in gastric cancer tissues
and its correlation between Twist and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT). By means of RT-PCR and Western blot, the mRNA and protein expressions of
Twist, E-cadherin, and Vimentin in 61 gastric cancer tissues and adjacent normal 
tissues were detected. The positive rates of Twist, E-cadherin, and Vimentin mRNA
expression in gastric cancer tissues were 73.9. 40.6, and 60.9 %, respectively;
compared to the expression of these genes in adjacent normal tissues (2.9, 75.4, 
and 27.5 %), the differences were significant (p < 0.05). The E-cadherin protein 
expression level in gastric cancer tissues was significantly lower than that in
the adjacent normal tissues (p < 0.05). After the transfection of Twist siRNA
into the MKN45 cells, the protein expression of Twist was significantly reduced
(p < 0.05), the protein expression of E-cadherin was significantly increased, and
the number of cells that passed through the Transwell chamber was significantly
lower than that in the non-transfected control group as well as the transfected
control group (p < 0.05). Twist may be associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition in gastric cancer and the tumorigenesis, invasion, and metastasis of
gastric cancer.

BACKGROUND: Twist, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, has been
reported to play a key role in the metastatic progression of several types of
cancer.
AIMS: To investigate the expression and clinical significance of Twist,
E-cadherin, and N-cadherin in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).
METHODS: The expression of Twist, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin in GISTs was
determined by immunohistochemistry, and their relationship with
clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed.
RESULTS: The positive rates of Twist, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin in GISTs were
66.7 % (52/78), 35.9 % (28/78), and 75.6 % (59/78), respectively. Twist was
expressed significantly more in GISTs with distant metastasis or local invasion
(p < 0.05). Although E-cadherin was expressed significantly less in cases of
GISTs with distant metastasis (p < 0.05), expression of N-cadherin did not differ
significantly according to clinical and pathological characteristics (p > 0.05). 
Expression of Twist was correlated positively with E-cadherin (rs = -0.253, p =
0.026) and negatively with N-cadherin (rs = 0.245, p = 0.030).
CONCLUSIONS: Twist was expressed significantly more and E-cadherin significantly 
less in GISTs with metastasis, and expression of both was closely related to
metastasis of GISTs.

Methylation profiling of normal individuals reveals mosaic promoter methylation
of cancer-associated genes.

Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.

Epigenetic silencing by promoter methylation of genes associated with cancer
initiation and progression is a hallmark of tumour cells. As a consequence,
testing for DNA methylation biomarkers in plasma or other body fluids shows great
promise for detection of malignancies at early stages and/or for monitoring
response to treatment. However, DNA from normal leukocytes may contribute to the 
DNA in plasma and will affect biomarker specificity if there is any methylation
in the leukocytes. DNA from 48 samples of normal peripheral blood mononuclear
cells was evaluated for the presence of methylation of a panel of DNA methylation
biomarkers that have been implicated in cancer. SMART-MSP, a methylation specific
PCR (MSP) methodology based on real time PCR amplification, high-resolution
melting and strategic primer design, enabled quantitative detection of low levels
of methylated DNA. Methylation was observed in all tested mononuclear cell DNA
samples for the CDH1 and HIC1 promoters and in majority of DNA samples for the
TWIST1 and DAPK1 promoters. APC and RARB promoter methylation, at a lower average
level, was also detected in a substantial proportion of DNA samples. We found no 
BRCA1, CDKN2A, GSTP1 and RASSF1A promoter methylation in this sample set. Several
individuals had higher levels of methylation at several loci suggestive of a
methylator phenotype. In conclusion, methylation of many potential DNA
methylation biomarkers can be detected in normal peripheral blood mononuclear
cells, and is likely to affect their specificity for detecting low level disease.
However, we found no evidence of promoter methylation for other genes indicating 
that panels of analytically sensitive and specific methylation biomarkers in body
fluids can be obtained.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a craniosynostosis syndrome that is rarely diagnosed 
prenatally. It is caused by cytogenetic deletions or mutations of the TWIST1
gene. We report here a de novo prenatal case with clinically and molecularly well
defined Saethre-Chotzen syndrome due to a TWIST1 deletion. This is the first
reported case of a deletion encompassing the TWIST1 gene to be diagnosed
prenatally. We recommend screening for a deletion of the TWIST1 gene if signs of 
coronal craniosynostosis with no clear etiology are observed on ultrasound
examination.

Molecular genetic analysis of TWIST1 and FGFR3 genes in Korean patients with
coronal synostosis: identification of three novel TWIST1 mutations.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Seoul National University College of Medicine,
Korea.

BACKGROUND: Craniosynostosis is very heterogeneous in terms of its causes,
presentation, and management. In particular, coronal synostosis evidences a
higher tendency to be genetically caused, and TWIST1 and FGFR3 have been
identified as major causative genes. The authors analyzed the clinical and
molecular characteristics of Korean patients with coronal synostosis in this
study.
METHODS: Forty-three Korean patients with unicoronal or bicoronal synostosis were
included in this study. All samples were first screened for TWIST1 and FGFR3
mutation hot spots, and the negative samples were subsequently screened for
FGFR2. The patients' clinical features were analyzed and compared.
RESULTS: Seven sequence alterations (six in TWIST1 and one in FGFR3) were
identified in 11 patients (25.6 percent). Three novel TWIST1 mutations were
detected, and p.P250R was the only mutation in FGFR3. Bicoronal cases evidenced a
much higher mutation detection rate (52.9 percent) than unicoronal cases (7.7
percent). In the TWIST1 group, five patients had Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, and
one was nonsyndromic. In the FGFR3 group, four patients had Muenke syndrome, and 
one was nonsyndromic. The majority of associated anomalies, with the exception of
psychomotor retardation and Chiari malformation, were detected more frequently in
TWIST1 patients than in FGFR3 p.P250R patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first to
illustrate the frequency and spectrum of mutations in TWIST1 and FGFR3 in Korea. 
Considering that molecular diagnosis techniques can prove helpful in providing
adequate genetic counseling and guidance, genetic screening for TWIST1 and FGFR3 
p.P250R in cases of coronal synostosis is recommended.

miRNAs play an important role in many human diseases, including cancer
metastasis. However, the mechanisms by which miRNAs regulate intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma metastasis remain poorly understood. In the present study, we 
assayed the expression level of miR-214 in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
tissues by real-time PCR, and defined the target gene and biological function by 
luciferase reporter assay and Western blot analysis. We found that the miR-214
levels were remarkably decreased in metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
tissues compared to non-metastatic tissues. Inhibition of miR-214 levels by its
inhibitor promoted metastasis of human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cell. We
further demonstrated that down-regulation of miR-214 increased the transcript
levels of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated gene Twist, and then
decreased E-cadherin levels. We confirmed that down-regulation of miR-214
promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition by directly targeting the Twist
gene. These results suggest an important role for miR-214 in regulating
metastasis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and potential application of
miR-214 in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma therapy.

Basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist1 inhibits transactivator
function of master chondrogenic regulator Sox9.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, The University of Texas Health Science Center at
San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas 78245, USA.

Canonical Wnt signaling strongly inhibits chondrogenesis. Previously, we
identified Twist1 as a critical downstream mediator of Wnt in repression of
chondrocyte differentiation. However, the mechanistic basis for the
antichondrogenic activity of Twist1 has not heretofore been established. Here, we
show that Twist1 suppresses cartilage development by directly inhibiting the
transcriptional activity of Sox9, the master regulator of chondrogenesis. Twist1,
through its carboxyl-terminal Twist-box, binds to the Sox9 high mobility group
DNA-binding domain, inhibiting Sox9 transactivation potential. In chondrocyte
precursor cells, Twist1, in a Twist-box-dependent manner, inhibits Sox9-dependent
activation of chondrocyte marker gene expression by blocking Sox9-enhancer DNA
association. These findings identify Twist1 as an inhibitor of Sox9 and further
suggest that the balance between Twist1 and Sox9 may determine the earliest steps
of chondrogenesis.

Increased Twist expression in advanced stage of mycosis fungoides and Sézary
syndrome.

Goswami M(1), Duvic M, Dougherty A, Ni X.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Dermatology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center,
Houston, TX, USA.

BACKGROUND: The mechanisms of tumor progression in mycosis fungoides (MF) and
Sézary syndrome (SS) are poorly understood. Twist, a transcription factor, is
thought to promote solid tumor progression by blocking p53 and inhibiting
c-myc-induced apoptosis. Whether Twist expression is correlated to MF/SS stages
remains unknown.
METHODS: Twist, c-myc and p53 proteins in 68 MF/SS lesions across all T stages
were examined by immunohistochemistry, and mRNA levels in peripheral blood CD4+
T-cells from SS patients were measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain
reaction.
RESULTS: Positive staining for Twist was found in 12.5% (2/16) of T1 and 33.3%
(7/21) of T2 early stage patches/plaques compared to 50.0% (9/18) of T3 tumors
and 84.6% (11/13) of T4 erythroderma. Most T4 erythroderma were positive for
Twist in dermal lymphocytes, with the strongest staining. Positive staining for
c-myc was higher in T3/T4 lesions (29/31, 93.5%) than T1/T2 lesions (25/37,
67.6%, p < 0.05), with strongest staining in T3 tumors. Aberrant p53 expression
was more common in T3/T4 lesions (8/31, 25.8%) than in T1/T2 lesions (2/37, 5.4%,
p < 0.05). Twist mRNA was detected in all CD4+ T cells from SS patients but not
in normal donors.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased Twist protein expression in advanced MF/SS lesions
suggests that Twist expression may correlate with MF/SS stages.

BACKGROUND: The majority of human cancer deaths are caused by metastasis. The
metastatic dissemination is initiated by the breakdown of epithelial cell
homeostasis. During this phenomenon, referred to as epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT), cells change their genetic and trancriptomic program leading to
phenotypic and functional alterations. The challenge of understanding this
dynamic process resides in unraveling regulatory networks involving master
transcription factors (e.g. SNAI1/2, ZEB1/2 and TWIST1) and microRNAs. Here we
investigated microRNAs regulated by SNAI1 and their potential role in the
regulatory networks underlying epithelial plasticity.
RESULTS: By a large-scale analysis on epithelial plasticity, we highlighted
miR-203 and its molecular link with SNAI1 and the miR-200 family, key regulators 
of epithelial homeostasis. During SNAI1-induced EMT in MCF7 breast cancer cells, 
miR-203 and miR-200 family members were repressed in a timely correlated manner. 
Importantly, miR-203 repressed endogenous SNAI1, forming a double negative
miR203/SNAI1 feedback loop. We integrated this novel miR203/SNAI1 with the known 
miR200/ZEB feedback loops to construct an a priori EMT core network. Dynamic
simulations revealed stable epithelial and mesenchymal states, and underscored
the crucial role of the miR203/SNAI1 feedback loop in state transitions
underlying epithelial plasticity.
CONCLUSION: By combining computational biology and experimental approaches, we
propose a novel EMT core network integrating two fundamental negative feedback
loops, miR203/SNAI1 and miR200/ZEB. Altogether our analysis implies that this
novel EMT core network could function as a switch controlling epithelial cell
plasticity during differentiation and cancer progression.

Direct conversion of tenocytes into chondrocytes by Sox9.

Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.

Sox9 is a high-mobility group box-containing transcription factor that functions 
as a key regulator of chondrogenesis. We here report that Sox9 mediates the
direct conversion of tenocytes to chondrocytes through an intermediate state in
which both differentiation programs are active. Sox9 is abundantly expressed in
cartilage but is undetectable in limb tendons that express Scleraxis (Scx) and
Tenomodulin (Tnmd), tendon-specific early and late molecular markers,
respectively. Upon forced expression of Sox9 in the chick forelimb, ectopic
cartilage formation is preferentially observed in fibrous tissues including the
tendons, ligaments, perichondrium/periosteum, dermis, and muscle connective
tissues. Tnmd expression in tenocytes isolated from leg tendons was markedly
upregulated by forced expression of basic helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) activators
including Scx, Paraxis, Twist1 and Twist2. In contrast, the overexpression of
Sox9 in monolayer tenocytes resulted in the downregulation of Tnmd and Scx
expressions during passaging in culture, and the induction of cartilage molecular
markers such as type II collagen (Col2a1) and Chondromodulin-I (ChM-I). This
Sox9-driven switching from a tenocytic to a chondrocytic gene expression profile 
was associated with a dramatic change from a spindle to a polygonal cellular
morphology. The extracellular accumulation of cartilage-characteristic
proteoglycans was also observed. These data suggest that tenocytes have a strong 
potential for conversion into chondrocytes through the activities of Sox9 both in
vitro and in vivo.

Cancer stem cells (CSC) play a significant role in tumor progression, disease
recurrence, and treatment failure. Here, we show that the endogenously expressed 
ETS transcription factor ESE3/EHF controls prostate epithelial cell
differentiation and stem-like potential. We found that loss of ESE3/EHF induced
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stem-like features, and
tumor-initiating and metastatic properties in prostate epithelial cells, and
reexpression of ESE3/EHF inhibited the stem-like properties and tumorigenic
potential of prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, ESE3/EHF repressed the
expression of key EMT and CSC genes, including TWIST1, ZEB2, BMI1, and POU5F1.
Analysis of human tissue microarrays showed that reduced ESE3/EHF expression is
an early event in tumorigenesis, frequently occurring independently of other ETS 
gene alterations. Additional analyses linked loss of ESE3/EHF expression to a
distinct group of prostate tumors with distinctive molecular and biologic
characteristics, including increased expression of EMT and CSC genes. Low
ESE3/EHF expression was also associated with increased biochemical recurrence of 
prostate cancer and reduced overall survival after prostatectomy. Collectively,
our findings define a key role for ESE3/EHF in the development of a subset of
prostate tumors and highlight the clinical importance of identifying molecularly 
defined tumor subgroups.

Epithelial to mesenchymal transition is activated in metastatic pheochromocytomas
and paragangliomas caused by SDHB gene mutations.

CONTEXT: Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma are rare neural-crest-derived tumors.
They are metastatic in 15% of cases, and the identification of a germline
mutation in the SDHB gene is a predictive risk factor for malignancy and poor
prognosis. To date, the link between SDHB mutations and malignancy is still
missing.
OBJECTIVE: Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental event,
reactivated in cancer cells to promote cell mobility and invasiveness. The aim of
this study was to address the participation of EMT in the metastatic evolution of
pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma.
DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Transcriptomic profiling of EMT was performed on 188 tumor
samples, using a set of 94 genes implicated in this pathway. Activation of EMT
was further confirmed at protein level by immunohistochemistry in a second set of
93 tumors.
RESULTS: Hierarchical unsupervised classification showed that most
SDHB-metastatic samples clustered together, indicating that EMT is differently
regulated in these tumors. Major actors of EMT, metalloproteases and components
of cellular junctions, were either up-regulated (LOXL2, TWIST, TCF3, MMP2, and
MMP1) or down-regulated (KRT19 and CDH2) in SDHB-metastatic tumors compared with 
nonmetastatic ones. Interestingly, within metastatic tumors, most of these genes 
(LOXL2, TWIST, TCF3, MMP2, and KRT19) also allowed us to discriminate
SDHB-mutated from non-SDHB-related tumors. In the second set of tumors, we
studied Snail1/2 expression by immunohistochemistry and observed its specific
nuclear translocation in all SDHB-metastatic tumors.
CONCLUSION: We have identified the first pathway that distinguishes
SDHB-metastatic from all other types of pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas and
suggest that activation of the EMT process might play a critical role in the
particularly invasive phenotype of this group of tumors.

hepatocellular carcinoma.

Loss or decreased expression of runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3), a
tumor suppressor gene involved in gastric and other cancers, has been frequently 
observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The objective of this study was to
identify the regulatory mechanism of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 
by RUNX3 in HCC. Human HCC cell lines, Hep3B, Huh7, HLF and SK-Hep1, were divided
into low- and high-EMT lines, based on their expression of TWIST1 and SNAI2, and 
were used in this in vitro study. Ectopic RUNX3 expression had an anti-EMT effect
in low-EMT HCC cell lines characterized by increased E-cadherin expression and
decreased N-cadherin and vimentin expression. RUNX3 expression has previously
been reported to reduce jagged-1 (JAG1) expression; therefore, JAG1 ligand
peptide was used to reinduce EMT in RUNX3-expressing low-EMT HCC cells.
Immunohistochemical analyses were performed for RUNX3, E-cadherin, N-cadherin and
TWIST1 in 33 human HCC tissues, also divided into low- and high-EMT HCC, based on
TWIST1 expression. E-cadherin expression was correlated positively and N-cadherin
expression was correlated negatively with RUNX3 expression in low-EMT HCC
tissues. Correlations between EMT markers and RUNX3 mRNA expression were analyzed
using Oncomine datasets. Similarly, mRNA expression of E-cadherin was also
significantly correlated with that of RUNX3 in low-EMT HCC, while mRNA expression
of JAG1 was negatively correlated with that of RUNX3. These results suggest a
novel mechanism by which loss or decreased expression of RUNX3 induces EMT via
induction of JAG1 expression in low-EMT HCC.

Palmitate enhances the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells towards
white adipocyte lineages.

Sciences, Foresterhill, Aberdeen, UK.

The number of adipocyte progenitors is determined early in foetal and neonatal
development in a process which may be altered by gender and excess nutrient
intake, and which in turn determines fat mass in adulthood and the risk of
developing obesity. Here we investigate the hypothesis that excess nutrients, in 
this case the long chain fatty acid palmitate, can program differentiating stem
cells towards white fat lineages. The experiments were performed on mouse
embryonic stem cells in chemically defined media (CDM) supplemented with bone
morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and all trans-retinoic acid (RA). Subsequent
treatment for 21 days with palmitate not only promoted the expression of
adipocyte markers and monolocular lipid deposition as observed by RT/QPCR and
immunocytochemistry, but also stimulated a considerable enrichment in adipocytes 
as measured by flow cytometry and a lipolytic response to catecholamines.
Palmitate increased protein levels of adiponectin that is preferentially
expressed in subcutaneous fat, while inhibiting IGFBP2 and IGFBP3 that are
associated with visceral fat. In keeping with this finding, palmitate also
increased expression of the subcutaneous markers Shox2 and Twist1 and
oestrogenising enzymes. Collectively, these results suggest that palmitate
induces differentiation towards subcutaneous fat and that this could occur
through its oestrogenising effects on the preadipocyte, suggesting a role for
palmitate in programming fat development towards a metabolically favourable
profile.

Molecular pathways: vasculogenic mimicry in tumor cells: diagnostic and
therapeutic implications.

Tumor cell vasculogenic mimicry (VM) describes the functional plasticity of
aggressive cancer cells forming de novo vascular networks, thereby providing a
perfusion pathway for rapidly growing tumors, transporting fluid from leaky
vessels, and/or connecting with endothelial-lined vasculature. The underlying
induction of VM seems to be related to hypoxia, which may also promote the
plastic, transendothelial phenotype of tumor cells capable of VM. Since its
introduction in 1999 as a novel paradigm for melanoma tumor perfusion, many
studies have contributed new insights into the underlying molecular pathways
supporting VM in a variety of tumors, including melanoma, glioblastoma,
carcinomas, and sarcomas. In particular, critical VM-modulating genes are
associated with vascular (VE-cadherin, EphA2, VEGF receptor 1), embryonic and/or 
stem cell (Nodal, Notch4), and hypoxia-related (hypoxia-inducible factor, Twist1)
signaling pathways. Each of these pathways warrants serious scrutiny as potential
therapeutic, vascular targets, and diagnostic indicators of plasticity, drug
resistance, and the aggressive metastatic phenotype.

Comment on
    Nat Cell Biol. 2012 Apr;14(4):366-74.

The transcription factor Twist1 is overexpressed in tumours and can induce the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition, resulting in increased invasiveness. Twist1 is
now shown to regulate cancer cell migration and invasion in three-dimensional
environments by activating the RAC1 GTPase through suppression of a let-7
microRNA family member.

The anti-apoptosis factor Bcl-2 is known to contribute to tumorigenesis and
metastasis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may also participate in tumor
invasion and metastasis. This study investigated the relationship between
coexpression profiles of Bcl-2 and EMT regulators in hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) tumor samples and clinical outcome. The nuclear (Nu) and cytoplasmic (Cyt) 
expression of Bcl-2 and the EMT regulators Twist-1, Twist-2, and Snail were
determined by immunohistochemical staining in tumor tissue isolated from 97 HCC
patients. The clinical prognostic values of both individual protein expression
and various expression combinations were investigated using univariate and
multivariate survival analysis. Results showed that patients with nuclear
expression of Bcl-2 had worse clinical outcomes than patients exhibiting
cytoplasmic expression. Overall survival was significantly shorter in HCC
patients individually expressing Bcl-2-Nu, Twist-1-Nu, Twist-1-Cyt, and Snail
(all P<0.05). Patients coexpressing Bcl-2-Nu with Twist-1-Nu, Twist-1-Cyt,
Twist-2, or Snail had even worse prognoses than those expressing no biomarker or 
any one biomarker alone (all P<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that HCC
patients coexpressing Bcl-2-Nu with Twist-1-Cyt had the worst prognosis. This
study provides clinical evidence that nuclear expression of Bcl-2 combined with
cytoplasmic expression of Twist-1 is a predictor of very poor prognosis in HCC.
Coexpression profiles of Bcl-2 and EMT regulators might aid in the selection of
the most efficacious therapy for patients with HCC.

TWIST represses estrogen receptor-alpha expression by recruiting the NuRD protein
complex in breast cancer cells.

Loss of estrogen receptor a (ERa) expression and gain of TWIST (TWIST1)
expression in breast tumors correlate with increased disease recurrence and
metastasis and poor disease-free survival. However, the molecular and functional 
regulatory relationship between TWIST and ERa are unclear. In this study, we
found TWIST was associated with a chromatin region in intron 7 of the human ESR1 
gene coding for ERa. This association of TWIST efficiently recruited the
nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) repressor complex to this region,
which subsequently decreased histone H3K9 acetylation, increased histone H3K9
methylation and repressed ESR1 expression in breast cancer cells. In agreement
with these molecular events, TWIST expression was inversely correlated with ERa
expression in both breast cancer cell lines and human breast ductal carcinomas.
Forced expression of TWIST in TWIST-negative and ERa-positive breast cancer cells
such as T47D and MCF-7 cells reduced ERa expression, while knockdown of TWIST in 
TWIST-positive and ERa-negative breast cancer cells such as MDA-MB-435 and 4T1
cells increased ERa expression. Furthermore, inhibition of histone deacetylase
(HDAC) activity including the one in NuRD complex significantly increased ERa
expression in MDA-MB-435 and 4T1 cells. HDAC inhibition together with TWIST
knockdown did not further increase ERa expression in 4T1 and MDA-MB-435 cells.
These results demonstrate that TWIST/NuRD represses ERa expression in breast
cancer cells. Therefore, TWIST may serve as a potential molecular target for
converting ERa-negative breast cancers to ERa-positive breast cancers, allowing
these cancers to restore their sensitivity to endocrine therapy with selective
ERa antagonists such as tamoxifen and raloxifene.

Mammary epithelial cell polarity is regulated differentially by p73 isoforms via

Davis, California 95616, USA.

p73 is expressed as TA and <U+0394>N isoforms, both of which are implicated in tumor
suppression and/or promotion. To address how p73 possesses these opposing
functions, we developed three-dimensional culture of MCF10A cells, which undergo 
cell morphogenesis to form polarized spheroids with hollow lumen similar to
normal mammary acini in vivo. Here, we showed that upon knockdown of p73,
particularly TAp73 but not <U+0394>Np73, MCF10A cells formed irregular and near-normal
acini without hollow lumen in three-dimensional culture. We also found that upon 
knockdown of p73 or TAp73, but not <U+0394>Np73, MCF10A cells underwent
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via down-regulation of E-cadherin
coupled with up-regulation of ß-catenin and laminin V. In addition, we found that
Snail-1, Slug, and Twist, all of which are known to act as EMT inducers by
repressing E-cadherin expression, were increased markedly upon knockdown of p73
and TAp73 but little if any by <U+0394>Np73. Furthermore, we showed that knockdown of
p73 or TAp73 in MCF10A cells led to a marked increase in cell proliferation and
migration. Together, our data suggest that TAp73 is necessary for maintaining
normal cell polarity by suppressing EMT.

Raf-1 oncogenic signaling is linked to activation of mesenchymal to epithelial
transition pathway in metastatic breast cancer cells.

Aberrant activation of the Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway plays a key role in breast cancer
development and progression. Dysregulation of Raf/MEK/MAPK oncogenic signaling
often results from overexpression of the HER-2/Neu tyrosine kinase receptor
leading to chemoendocrine resistance, development of distant metastases and
ultimately poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. HER-2/Neu overexpression is 
also linked to activation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)
pathway, loss of adhesion molecules and metastasis. Recently, it has been
demonstrated that cancer cells that undergo EMT acquire a CD44+/CD24-/low basal
cancer stem cell-like phenotype and are characterized by activation of HER-2/Neu 
and TGFß oncogenic signaling pathways with increased capacity of self-renewal,
drug resistance, invasion and distant metastases. Following metastatic
dissemination, cancer cells re-activate certain epithelial properties through
mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) to establish neoplastic lesions at
secondary sites, although the molecular mechanisms regulating MET remain elusive.
In this study we demonstrate that constitutive activation of Raf-1 oncogenic
signaling induces HER-2/Neu overexpression leading to the development of distant 
metastases in ERa+ MCF-7 breast cancer xenografts. Importantly, development of
distant metastases in xenograft models was linked to activation of the MET
pathway characterized by reduced expression of EMT inducer genes (TGFB2, TWIST1
and FOXC1) and overexpression of BMB7, CXCR7 and EGR family of transcription
factors. In summary, our results demonstrate for the first time that
amplification of Raf/MEK/MAPK oncogenic signaling during tumor growth promotes
the genesis of metastatic lesions from primary tumors by activating the
mesenchymal epithelial transition.

Bile-based detection of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with quantitative DNA
methylation markers and its high sensitivity.

Extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EHC) is usually difficult to diagnose by bile
cytology because of cellular disintegration. However, DNA samples from bile fluid
can provide sufficient materials to screen for the presence of EHC. We developed 
DNA methylation marker panels that can be used for MethyLight assay-based
detection of EHC in bile fluid specimens. The methylation status of 59 DNA
methylation markers was investigated in 20 EHC and 20 non-neoplastic gallbladder 
tissue samples with MethyLight assay to determine cancer-specific DNA methylation
markers. Through assaying cancer-specific DNA methylation markers in a training
set (n = 40) and validation set (n = 45) of bile fluid specimens from patients
with EHC or those without cancer, we selected suitable marker panels that were
assessed for their performance in a third set (test set; n = 40). Four marker
panels showed a sensitivity of 60% or more and a specificity of 100% in both the 
training and validation sets, whereas bile cytology displayed a sensitivity of
40% to 46% and a specificity of 100%. In an independent test set of bile fluid
samples, a five-gene panel (CCND2, CDH13, GRIN2B, RUNX3, and TWIST1) detected EHC
at a sensitivity of 83%, which was far higher than that of bile cytology (46%, P 
= 0.004). Using bile fluids, a methylation assay consisting of a five-gene panel 
may be useful for detecting EHC and in helping to increase the sensitivity of
preoperative diagnoses.

Mesenchymal and stemness circulating tumor cells in early breast cancer
diagnosis.

Barrière G(1), Riouallon A, Renaudie J, Tartary M, Rigaud M.

Author information: 
(1)Astralab clinical laboratory, Limoges, France.

BACKGROUND: Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial event likely
involved in dissemination of epithelial cancer cells. This process enables them
to acquire migratory/invasive properties, contributing to tumor and metastatic
spread. To know if this event is an early one in breast cancer, we developed a
clinical trial. The aim of this protocol was to detect circulating tumor cells
endowed with mesenchymal and/or stemness characteristics, at the time of initial 
diagnosis. Breast cancer patients (n = 61), without visceral or bone metastasis
were enrolled and analysis of these dedifferentiated circulating tumor cells
(ddCTC) was realized.
METHODS: AdnaGen method was used for enrichment cell selection. Then, ddCTC were 
characterized by RT-PCR study of the following genes: PI3Ka, Akt-2, Twist1 (EMT
markers) and ALDH1, Bmi1 and CD44 (stemness indicators).
RESULTS: Among the studied primary breast cancer cohort, presence of ddCTC was
detected in 39% of cases. This positivity is independant from tumor
clinicopathological factors apart from the lymph node status.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data uniquely demonstrated that in vivo EMT occurs in the
primary tumors and is associated with an enhanced ability of tumor cells to
intravasate in the early phase of cancer disease. These results suggest that
analysis of circulating tumor cells focused on cells showing mesenchymal or
stemness characteristics might facilitate assessment of new drugs in clinical
trials.

Over 57% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients have regional or distant spread of
their disease at the time of diagnosis. Despite recent advances, there is a
compelling need to better characterize prognostic markers for advanced CRC. The
present study investigates protein expression of NHERF1, HIF-1a and TWIST1 and
their relationship in distant normal mucosa (DNM), tumor (T) and adjacent normal 
mucosa (ANM), lymph node metastasis (LNM) and liver metastasis (LM), determining 
their role as potential markers in advanced stages of human CRC. Overexpression
of nuclear NHERF1 was shown in 47% of tumors, which exhibited a significant
association with poor histological grade (P=0.0346). Nuclear NHERF1 showed a
higher expression in T, LNM and LM than both DNM (P<0.0001) and ANM (P<0.05).
Nuclear HIF-1a was significantly higher in T, LNM and LM than DNM and ANM
(P<0.05, P<0.001, P<0.0001, respectively). A positive correlation between nuclear
NHERF1 and nuclear HIF-1a was found in LNM (r=0.331, P=0.020), where an extended 
co-localization of the two proteins was demonstrated. TWIST1 was more expressed
in T than DNM and ANM (P<0.0001) and was higher in T than LNM and LM (P<0.0001). 
Moreover, nuclear NHERF1 was directly correlated to TWIST1 (r=0.339, P=0.015) in 
T samples, where a high co-expression of the two proteins was demonstrated both
in no longer polarized epithelial cells and in invasive mesenchymal elements
adjacent to hypoxic and perinecrotic colonic areas. Overall, nuclear NHERF1
expression was associated with poorer differentiation grade and with higher
expression both of HIF-1a in lymphatic metastasis and TWIST1 in invasive front of
tumor. Our results support the oncogenic role of NHERF1 and promote nuclear
NHERF1 as a potential new biomarker of advanced CRC.

Peritumoral vascular invasion and NHERF1 expression define an immunophenotype of 
grade 2 invasive breast cancer associated with poor prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Traditional determinants proven to be of prognostic importance in
breast cancer include the TNM staging, histological grade, proliferative
activity, hormone receptor status and HER2 overexpression. One of the limitations
of the histological grading scheme is that a high percentage of breast cancers
are still classified as grade 2, a category with ambiguous clinical significance.
The aim of this study was to best characterize tumors scored as grade 2.
METHODS: We investigated traditional prognostic factors and a panel of tumor
markers not used in routine diagnosis, such as NHERF1, VEGFR1, HIF-1a and TWIST1,
in 187 primary invasive breast cancers by immunohistochemistry, stratifying
patients into good and poor prognostic groups by the Nottingham Prognostic Index.
RESULTS: Grade 2 subgroup analysis showed that the PVI (p = 0.023) and the loss
of membranous NHERF1 (p = 0.028) were adverse prognostic factors. Relevantly, 72%
of grade 2 tumors were associated to PVI+/membranous NHERF1- expression
phenotype, characterizing an adverse prognosis (p = 0.000). Multivariate logistic
regression analysis in the whole series revealed poor prognosis correlated with
PVI and MIB1 (p = 0.000 and p = 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, in the whole
series of breast cancers we found cytoplasmic NHERF1 expression positively
correlated to VEGFR1 (r = 0.382, p = 0.000), and in VEGFR1-overexpressing tumors 
the oncogenic receptor co-localized with NHERF1 at cytoplasmic level.
CONCLUSIONS: The PVI+/membranous NHERF1- expression phenotype identifies a
category of grade 2 tumors with the worst prognosis, including patient subgroup
with a family history of breast cancer. These observations support the idea of
the PVI+/membranous NHERF1- expression immunophenotype as a useful marker, which 
could improve the accuracy of predicting clinical outcome in grade 2 tumors.

INTRODUCTION: A gene expression signature indicative of activated wound responses
is common to more than 90% of non-neoplastic tissues adjacent to breast cancer,
but these tissues also exhibit substantial heterogeneity. We hypothesized that
gene expression subtypes of breast cancer microenvironment can be defined and
that these microenvironment subtypes have clinical relevance.
METHODS: Gene expression was evaluated in 72 patient-derived breast tissue
samples adjacent to invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ.
Unsupervised clustering identified two distinct gene expression subgroups that
differed in expression of genes involved in activation of fibrosis, cellular
movement, cell adhesion and cell-cell contact. We evaluated the prognostic
relevance of extratumoral subtype (comparing the Active group, defined by high
expression of fibrosis and cellular movement genes, to the Inactive group,
defined by high expression of claudins and other cellular adhesion and cell-cell 
contact genes) using clinical data. To establish the biological characteristics
of these subtypes, gene expression profiles were compared against published and
novel tumor and tumor stroma-derived signatures (Twist-related protein 1 (TWIST1)
overexpression, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-ß)-induced fibroblast
activation, breast fibrosis, claudin-low tumor subtype and estrogen response).
Histological and immunohistochemical analyses of tissues representing each
microenvironment subtype were performed to evaluate protein expression and
compositional differences between microenvironment subtypes.
RESULTS: Extratumoral Active versus Inactive subtypes were not significantly
associated with overall survival among all patients (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.4, 95%
CI 0.6 to 2.8, P = 0.337), but there was a strong association with overall
survival among estrogen receptor (ER) positive patients (HR = 2.5, 95% CI 0.9 to 
6.7, P = 0.062) and hormone-treated patients (HR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 7.0, P =
0.045). The Active subtype of breast microenvironment is correlated with
TWIST-overexpression signatures and shares features of claudin-low breast
cancers. The Active subtype was also associated with expression of TGF-ß induced 
fibroblast activation signatures, but there was no significant association
between Active/Inactive microenvironment and desmoid type fibrosis or estrogen
response gene expression signatures. Consistent with the RNA expression profiles,
Active cancer-adjacent tissues exhibited higher density of TWIST nuclear
staining, predominantly in epithelium, and no evidence of increased fibrosis.
CONCLUSIONS: These results document the presence of two distinct subtypes of
microenvironment, with Active versus Inactive cancer-adjacent extratumoral
microenvironment influencing the aggressiveness and outcome of ER-positive human 
breast cancers.

Correlation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers with clinicopathologic
parameters in adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is characterized by the loss of
epithelial cell junction proteins and the gain of mesenchymal markers. The aim of
this study was to analyze the associations between the EMT-related markers
vimentin, E-cadherin, ß-catenin, slug, snail, and twist1 and clinicopathologic
parameters as well as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene copy number
and protein expression in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Fifty-nine
squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and 43 adenocarcinomas (AD) were
immunohistochemically examined for respective EMT markers and for EGFR, using the
EGFR PharmDx kit (Dako) for protein expression and automated silver enhanced in
situ hybridization (SISH) for copy number. Vimentin expression in tumor epithelia
was significantly higher in AD samples than in SCC samples (P=0.015). Among AD
samples, vimentin expression was positively correlated with histologic grade (2
vs. 3; P=0.021) and exhibited a tendency toward a positive correlation with pTNM 
stage (I vs. II-IV; P=0.052). EGFR gene copy number was positively correlated
with EGFR protein expression among both AD samples (P=0.008) and SCC samples
(P=0.042), with EGFR protein expression being significantly higher in SCC samples
compared with AD (P=0.038). Among AD samples, EGFR protein expression was
associated with higher cytoplasmic expression of ß-catenin (P=0.031). Among SCC
samples, EGFR protein expression was negatively correlated with nuclear
expression of ß-catenin (P=0.033) but positively with nuclear slug (P=0.021). The
expression pattern of EMT markers in AD suggests that vimentin is a possible
immunohistochemical predictor of tumor progression.

Repulsive guidance molecule B (RGMB) plays negative roles in breast cancer by
coordinating BMP signaling.

Medicine, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK.

Repulsive guidance molecules (RGMs) coordinate axon formation and iron
homestasis. These molecules are also known as co-receptors of bone morphogenetic 
proteins (BMPs). However, the role played by RGMs in breast cancer remains
unclear. The present study investigated the impact of RGMB on functions of breast
cancer cells and corresponding mechanisms. RGMB was knocked down in breast cancer
cells by way of an anti-RGMB ribozyme transgene. Knockdown of RGMB resulted in
enhanced capacities of proliferation, adhesion, and migration in breast cancer
cells. Further investigations demonstrated RGMB knockdown resulted in a reduced
expression and activity of Caspase-3, accompanied with better survival in RGMB
knockdown cells under serum starvation, which might be induced by its repression 
on MAPK JNK pathway. Up-regulations of Snai1, Twist, FAK, and Paxillin via
enhanced Smad dependent sigaling led to increased capacities of adhesion and
migration. Our current data firstly revealed that RGMB may act as a negative
regulator in breast cancer through BMP signaling.

Specific inactivation of Twist1 in the mandibular arch neural crest cells affects
the development of the ramus and reveals interactions with hand2.

Zhang Y(1), Blackwell EL, McKnight MT, Knutsen GR, Vu WT, Ruest LB.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biomedical Sciences, TAMHSC-Baylor College of Dentistry, Dallas,
Texas, USA.

BACKGROUND: The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Twist1
fulfills an essential function in neural crest cell formation, migration, and
survival and is associated with the craniosynostic Saethre-Chotzen syndrome in
humans. However, its functions during mandibular development, when it may
interact with other bHLH transcription factors like Hand2, are unknown because
mice homozygous for the Twist1 null mutation die in early embryogenesis. To
determine the role of Twist1 during mandibular development, we used the Hand2-Cre
transgene to conditionally inactivate the gene in the neural crest cells
populating the mandibular pharyngeal arch.
RESULTS: The mutant mice exhibited a spectrum of craniofacial anomalies,
including mandibular hypoplasia, altered middle ear development, and cleft
palate. It appears that Twist1 is essential for the survival of the neural crest 
cells involved in the development of the mandibular ramal elements. Twist1 plays 
a role in molar development and cusp formation by participating in the reciprocal
signaling needed for the formation of the enamel knot. This gene is also needed
to control the ossification of the mandible, a redundant role shared with Hand2.
CONCLUSION: Twist1, along with Hand2, is essential for the proximodistal
patterning and development of the mandible and ossification.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is characterized by the
suppression of the adhesion protein E-cadherin, is a crucial process that
promotes metastasis and stem-like properties of cancer cells. However, the
dissociation of cellular aggregates is not sufficient to explain why cancer cells
move, and the motile nature of cancer cells undergoing EMT remains elusive. Here,
we identify a mechanism in which the EMT inducer Twist1 elicits cancer cell
movement through activation of RAC1. Twist1 cooperates with BMI1 to suppress
let-7i expression, which results in upregulation of NEDD9 and DOCK3, leading to
RAC1 activation and enabling mesenchymal-mode movement in three-dimensional
environments. Moreover, the suppression of let-7i contributes to Twist1-induced
stem-like properties. Clinically, activation of the Twist1-let-7i-NEDD9 axis in
head and neck cancer patients correlates with tumour invasiveness and worse
outcome. Our results uncover an essential mechanism to explain how Twist1 induces
the motile stem-like cancer cell phenotype beyond simply suppressing E-cadherin.

AIMS: This study investigates whether matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
specifically MMP-2 and MMP-9, interacting with other molecules important in
osteoblast differentiation and osteoclastogenesis, could play important roles in 
the invasion of bone by oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
METHODS: Supernatant (conditioned medium, CM) was collected from OSCC cell lines 
(SCC15 and SCC25), and from cultured osteoblasts (hFOB cell line and a primary
culture, OB), and used for indirect co-culture: OSCC cells were treated with CM
from osteoblasts and vice versa. Zymogenic activities of MMP-2 and -9, and
protein quantities of all molecules studied, were detected by gelatine zymography
and Western blotting, respectively. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
analysed mRNA of these molecules. Targeted molecules were examined by
immunohistochemistry in tissue sections of bone-invasive OSCCs.
RESULTS: Zymogenic activities of both MMPs were increased in OSCC cells following
culture with CM from hFOB: Twist1 protein expression was increased while Runx2
did not alter. The RANKL/OPG ratio, zymogen and protein expression of MMP-9 were 
increased in hFOB cells cultured with CM from OSCC lines, while zymogen
expression of MMP-2 was decreased. Real-time PCR showed generally similar changes
in expression of these molecules. All targeted molecules were expressed in
invading malignant keratinocytes, and all but OPG were expressed in osteoclasts
of clinical samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Crosstalk between different cell types appears to exist in the
invasion of bone by OSCC. Understanding and ultimately interfering with the
molecules involved may provide therapeutic approaches to inhibit such bone
invasion.

oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

We have investigated mRNA and protein expression of TWIST, Vimentin and
E-cadherin in ESCC (oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma) and explored their
relationship with tumour's infiltration and metastasis. RT-PCR (reverse
transcriptase-PCR) was used to evaluate mRNA expression of TWIST, E-cadherin and 
Vimentin in 40 cases of ESCC. The protein expression of the genes was examined by
immunohistochemical staining in each specimen. Expression of TWIST, E-cadherin
and Vimentin mRNA and protein with clinicopathologic parameters were analysed.
mRNAs of TWIST, Vimentin and E-cadherin were expressed in 75, 55 and 35%
respectively of ESCC, i.e. significantly different from that in normal
oesophageal mucosa (15, 0 and 85% respectively; P<0.01). In ESCC with LN (lymph
node) metastasis, expression of TWIST and Vimentin mRNA, but not E-cadherin mRNA 
was significantly higher (100 and 83%) than in ESCC without LN metastasis (64 and
43%, P=0.018) respectively. Levels of mRNA expression of the 3 genes followed
similar patterns to their above-mentioned frequencies. Protein expression of
TWIST, E-cadherin and Vimentin were observed in 70, 35 and 50% respectively of
ESCC, which were significantly different from normal mucosa (15, 80 and 0%;
P<0.001). In ESCC with LN metastasis, protein expression of TWIST and Vimentin,
but not E-cadherin, were significantly higher (100 and 75%) than in ESCC without 
LN metastasis (61 and 39%). Protein expression of TWIST was positively correlated
with Vimentin (r=0.327, P=0.039), but negatively correlated with E-cadherin
(r=<U+200A>-0.633, P=0.000). Thus, both mRNAs and proteins of TWIST and Vimentin were
significantly overexpressed in ESCC, especially ESCC with LN metastasis. The mRNA
and protein of E-cadherin were down-regulated in ESCC. These results suggest
potential roles of TWIST as the promoter of tumour invasion and metastasis
associated with down-regulation of E-cadherin.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical process for embryogenesis
but is abnormally activated during cancer metastasis and recurrence. This process
enables epithelial cancer cells to acquire mobility and traits associated with
stemness. It is unknown whether epithelial stem cells or epithelial cancer stem
cells are able to undergo EMT, and what molecular mechanism regulates this
process in these specific cell types. We found that epithelial-ovarian cancer
stem cells (EOC stem cells) are the source of metastatic progenitor cells through
a differentiation process involving EMT and mesenchymal-epithelial transition
(MET). We demonstrate both in vivo and in vitro the differentiation of EOC stem
cells into mesenchymal spheroid-forming cells (MSFCs) and their capacity to
initiate an active carcinomatosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that human EOC
stem cells injected intraperitoneally in mice are able to form ovarian tumors,
suggesting that the EOC stem cells have the ability to 'home' to the ovaries and 
establish tumors. Most interestingly, we found that TWIST-1 is constitutively
degraded in EOC stem cells, and that the acquisition of TWIST-1 requires
additional signals that will trigger the differentiation process. These findings 
are relevant for understanding the differentiation and metastasis process in EOC 
stem cells.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cervical carcinoma.

Lee MY, Shen MR.

During the progression of epithelial cancer, cells usually lose epithelial
characteristic features and gain a mesenchymal phenotype. Cervical cancer is a
common female malignancy worldwide. Despite the generally good prognosis for
early-stage cervical cancer patients, many patients still die as a result of
metastasis and recurrence. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been
implicated in the metastasis of primary tumors and provides molecular mechanisms 
for cervical cancer metastasis. Here we provide an up-to-date overview regarding 
the program of EMT in cervical cancer. In the stepwise progression of cervical
cancer, human papilloma viral proteins contribute to the cell transformation and 
the conversion of typical epithelial cells to the epithelial carcinoma cells with
hybrid epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics. Molecules related to the EMT
program of cervical cancer cells are summarized in this review paper. Several
soluble factors acting on their cognate receptors stimulate the mesenchymal
transition of cervical epithelial cells. Ion transport system as well as
cytoskeletal modulators also stimulate the progression of EMT program in cervical
carcinoma cells. Transcriptional factors such as Snail, Twist1, Twist2, and six1 
homeoproteins are involved in the complicated regulation and cervical cancer
metastasis. Among the various signalings associated with EMT program, Snail is a 
central transcription factor which governs EMT program. In contrast to tumor
promoters, several tumor suppressors such as SFRP1/2 and LMX-1A have been
reported to suppress tumorigenesis as well as metastatic spread through
inhibiting the EMT program.

transition in pancreatic cancer cells].

OBJECTIVE: To explore the blocking effects of hedgehog signaling pathway on the
processes of cell migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
in human pancreatic cancer cells and elucidate its possible mechanisms.
METHODS: The lentiviral expression vector for RNA interference of human
Smoothened (SMO) gene was constructed to silence the expression of SMO. And RNAi 
against SMO was used to suppress the hedgehog signaling pathway in human
pancreatic cancer Panc-1 cells. The in vitro invasion capacity in Panc-1 cells
was assessed by Matrigel/Transwell chamber assay. Real-time PCR (polymerase chain
reaction) and Western blot were used to detect the expressions of such EMT
markers as E-cadherin, N-cadherin, ß-catenin, vimentin and fibronectin and such
transcription factors as Snail, Slug, Twist1 and Sip1.
RESULTS: The stable interference of SMO could suppress the hedgehog signaling
activity in Panc-1 cells. The inhibition of hedgehog signaling reduced the in
vitro invasion capacity significantly in Panc-1 cells. The expression of
E-cadherin significantly increased while N-cadherin, vimentin and fibronectin
were significantly down-regulated in the RNAi group. Compared to the control
group, the expressions of Snail and Slug were significantly reduced in the SMO
knock-down group.
CONCLUSION: The inhibition of hedgehog signaling pathway reduces the in vitro
invasion capacity in human pancreatic cancer cells. And the EMT process is
significantly suppressed. The mechanism is partially correlated with the
down-regulations of Snail and Slug.

PURPOSE: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)- related factors are known to
contribute to the invasion and migration of multiple cancers. However, the
expression levels of and the relationship between TWIST, E-cadherin, and
beta-catenin in bladder cancer are not yet known. Therefore, this study
investigated the relationship between TWIST, E-cadherin, and beta-catenin in
tissue specimens and cell lines of bladder cancer.
METHODS: Microarrays of bladder cancer tissue and bladder cancer cell lines were 
used to study the expression levels of TWIST, E-cadherin, and beta-catenin, with 
disease stage and grade using immunohistochemistry. Moreover, the siRNAs of
TWIST, E-cadherin, and beta-catenin were transfected into the bladder cancer cell
lines to study any relationship between these factors.
RESULTS: The levels of TWIST and beta-catenin were upregulated with increasing
grade of malignancy. In contrast, the corresponding results for E-cadherin were
just the opposite. Furthermore, inhibition of the expression of TWIST elevated
the expression of E-cadherin, but reduced the expression of beta-catenin.
However, reduction of beta-catenin by siRNA had no influence on TWIST, but
up-regulated the expression of E-cadherin.
CONCLUSION: TWIST may act upstream of E-cadherin, which can indirectly regulate
the expression levels of beta-catenin. The EMT factors TWIST, E-cadherin, and
beta-catenin may be a cluster of biomarkers for the metastatic progression of
bladder cancer.

The main impairment to tissue maintenance during aging is the reduced capacity
for stem cell self-renewal over time due to senescence, the irreversible block in
proliferation. We have previously described that the basic helix-loop-helix
(bHLH) transcription factor Twist-1 can greatly enhance the life span of bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). In the present study, we
show that Twist-1 potently suppresses senescence and the Ink4A/Arf locus with a
dramatic decrease in the expression of p16 and to some extent a decrease in p14. 
Furthermore, the polycomb group protein and histone methyltransferase Ezh2, which
suppresses the Ink4A/Arf locus, was found to be induced by Twist-1, resulting in 
an increase in H3K27me3 along the Ink4A/Arf locus, repressing transcription of
both p16/p14 and senescence of human MSCs. Furthermore, Twist-1 inhibits the
expression of the bHLH transcription factor E47, which is normally expressed in
senescent MSCs and induces transcription of the p16 promoter. Reduced Twist-1
wild-type expression and function in bone cells derived from Saethre-Chotzen
patients also revealed an increase in senescence. These studies for the first
time link Twist-1 to histone methylation of the Ink4A/Arf locus by controlling
the expression of histone methyltransferases as well as the expression of other
bHLH factors.

HMGA1 induces intestinal polyposis in transgenic mice and drives tumor
progression and stem cell properties in colon cancer cells.

BACKGROUND: Although metastatic colon cancer is a leading cause of cancer death
worldwide, the molecular mechanisms that enable colon cancer cells to metastasize
remain unclear. Emerging evidence suggests that metastatic cells develop by
usurping transcriptional networks from embryonic stem (ES) cells to facilitate an
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, and metastatic progression.
Previous studies identified HMGA1 as a key transcription factor enriched in ES
cells, colon cancer, and other aggressive tumors, although its role in these
settings is poorly understood.
METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To determine how HMGA1 functions in metastatic colon 
cancer, we manipulated HMGA1 expression in transgenic mice and colon cancer
cells. We discovered that HMGA1 drives proliferative changes, aberrant crypt
formation, and intestinal polyposis in transgenic mice. In colon cancer cell
lines from poorly differentiated, metastatic tumors, knock-down of HMGA1 blocks
anchorage-independent cell growth, migration, invasion, xenograft tumorigenesis
and three-dimensional colonosphere formation. Inhibiting HMGA1 expression blocks 
tumorigenesis at limiting dilutions, consistent with depletion of tumor-initiator
cells in the knock-down cells. Knock-down of HMGA1 also inhibits metastatic
progression to the liver in vivo. In metastatic colon cancer cells, HMGA1 induces
expression of Twist1, a gene involved in embryogenesis, EMT, and tumor
progression, while HMGA1 represses E-cadherin, a gene that is down-regulated
during EMT and metastatic progression. In addition, HMGA1 is among the most
enriched genes in colon cancer compared to normal mucosa.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate for the first time that HMGA1 drives
proliferative changes and polyp formation in the intestines of transgenic mice
and induces metastatic progression and stem-like properties in colon cancer
cells. These findings indicate that HMGA1 is a key regulator, both in metastatic 
progression and in the maintenance of a stem-like state. Our results also suggest
that HMGA1 or downstream pathways could be rational therapeutic targets in
metastatic, poorly differentiated colon cancer.

Metastasis is a multistep process and the main cause of mortality in lung cancer 
patients. We previously showed that EGFR mutations were associated with a copy
number gain at a locus encompassing the TWIST1 gene on chromosome 7. TWIST1 is a 
highly conserved developmental gene involved in embryogenesis that may be
reactivated in cancers promoting both malignant conversion and cancer progression
through an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). The aim of this study was 
to investigate the possible implication of TWIST1 reactivation on the acquisition
of a mesenchymal phenotype in EGFR mutated lung cancer. We studied a series of
consecutive lung adenocarcinoma from Caucasian non-smokers for which surgical
frozen samples were available (n<U+200A>=<U+200A>33) and showed that TWIST1 expression was
linked to EGFR mutations (P<0.001), to low CDH1 expression (P<0.05) and low
disease free survival (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.044). To validate that TWIST1 is a driver of EMT in 
EGFR mutated lung cancer, we used five human lung cancer cell lines and
demonstrated that EMT and the associated cell mobility were dependent upon TWIST1
expression in cells with EGFR mutation. Moreover a decrease of EGFR pathway
stimulation through EGF retrieval or an inhibition of TWIST1 expression by small 
RNA technology reversed the phenomenon. Collectively, our in vivo and in vitro
findings support that TWIST1 collaborates with the EGF pathway in promoting EMT
in EGFR mutated lung adenocarcinoma and that large series of EGFR mutated lung
cancer patients are needed to further define the prognostic role of TWIST1
reactivation in this subgroup.

BACKGROUND: Aberrant expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has
been detected in pancreatic cancer; however, the mechanisms of EGFR in inducing
pancreatic cancer development have not been adequately elucidated. The objective 
of this study was to determine the role of EGFR in mediating
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in pancreatic cancer cells.
METHODS: Pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 was transfected with small
interfering RNA of EGFR by use of a lentiviral expression vector to establish an 
EGFR-knockdown cell line (si-PANC-1). PANC-1 cells transfected with lentiviral
vector expressing negative control sequence were used as negative control
(NC-PANC-1). Scratch assay and transwell study were used to analyze cell
migration and invasion. Real-time PCR and Western blotting were used to detect
the expression of EMT markers E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin
and transcription factors snail, slug, twist1, and sip1 in PANC-1, NC-PANC-1, and
si-PANC-1 cells. Immunofluorescent staining with these antibodies and confocal
microscopy were used to observe their cellular location and morphologic changes.
RESULTS: After RNA interference of EGFR, the migration and invasion ability of
si-PANC-1 cells decreased significantly. The expression of epithelial phenotype
marker E-cadherin increased and the expression of mesenchymal phenotype markers
N-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin decreased, indicating reversion of EMT. We 
also observed intracellular translocation of E-cadherin. Expression of
transcription factors snail and slug in si-PANC-1 cells decreased significantly.
CONCLUSION: Suppression of EGFR expression can significantly inhibit EMT of
pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells. The mechanism may be related with the
down-regulation of the expression of transcription factors snail and slug.

TWIST1 is a highly conserved basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that
promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Its misregulation has been
observed in various types of tumors. Using the MCF-10A-series of cell lines that 
recapitulate the early stages of breast cancer formation and EMT, we found TWIST1
to be upregulated during EMT and downregulated early in carcinogenesis. The
TWIST1 3'UTR contains putative regulatory elements, including miRNA target sites 
and two cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPE). We found that miR-580, CPEB1,
and CPEB2 act as negative regulators of TWIST1 expression in a sequence-specific 
and additive/cooperative manner.

vulvar cancer.

University of Groningen, PO Box 30 001, 9700RB Groningen, The Netherlands.

OBJECTIVE: Lymph node status in early-stage vulvar cancer can be accurately
assessed by the sentinel-node (SN) procedure. Molecular techniques, such as
DNA-methylation assay, might improve SN assessment. In this study, we selected
methylation markers for vulvar cancer and determined if these methylation markers
were suitable for lymph node assessment.
METHODS: We performed methylation specific PCR on DNA isolated from primary
tumors, metastatic lymph nodes, and negative lymph nodes from twenty vulvar
cancer patients using the following genes: P16INK4a, MGMT, TWIST1, CADM1, TERT,
and TFPI2. For P16INK4a and MGMT immunohistochemistry was performed on primary
tumors and metastatic lymph nodes in order to explore intratumor heterogeneity in
gene expression patterns.
RESULTS: TERT was methylated in all vulvar cancers, P16INK4a in 13/20, TFPI2 in
12/20, CADM1 in 11/20, MGMT in 9/20, and TWIST1 in 7/20. A panel of three
methylation markers (P16INK4a, TERT and TFPI2) reached a sensitivity of 67% and
specificity of 100% for detection of metastatic lymph nodes. Immunohistochemistry
showed intratumor heterogeneity for expression of P16INK4a and MGMT in
respectively 55% and 45% of primary tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows methylation for one or more methylation markers in
all vulvar cancers. Despite a specificity of 100% our panel of three methylation 
markers had only moderate sensitivity for metastatic lymph node detection,
thereby limiting its applicability for lymph node assessment. Intratumor
heterogeneity for expression of P16INK4a and MGMT may reflect intratumor
heterogeneity for methylation patterns and thereby in general explain the
moderate sensitivity of our marker panel for detection of metastases.

INTRODUCTION: The presence of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in breast cancer
might be associated with stem cell-like tumor cells which have been suggested to 
be the active source of metastatic spread in primary tumors. Furthermore, to be
able to disseminate and metastasize, CTC must be able to perform
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We studied the expression of three EMT
markers and the stem cell marker ALDH1 in CTC from 502 primary breast cancer
patients. Data were correlated with the presence of disseminated tumor cells
(DTC) in the bone marrow (BM) and with clinicopathological data of the patients.
METHODS: A total of 2 × 5 ml of blood was analyzed for CTC with the AdnaTest
BreastCancer (AdnaGen AG) for the detection of EpCAM, MUC-1, HER2 and beta-Actin 
transcripts. The recovered c-DNA was additionally multiplex tested for three EMT 
markers [TWIST1, Akt2, phosphoinositide kinase-3 (PI3Ka)] and separately for the 
tumor stem cell marker ALDH1. The identification of EMT markers was considered
positive if at least one marker was detected in the sample. Two BM aspirates from
all patients were analyzed for DTC by immunocytochemistry using the
pan-cytokeratin antibody A45-B/B3.
RESULTS: Ninety-seven percent of 30 healthy donor samples investigated were
negative for EMT and 95% for ALDH1 transcripts, respectively. CTC were detected
in 97/502 (19%) patients. At least one of the EMT markers was expressed in 29%
and ALDH1 was present in 14% of the samples, respectively. Interestingly, 5% of
the ALDH1-positive and 18% of the EMT-positive patients were CTC-negative based
on the cut-off level determined for CTC-positivity applying the AdnaTest
BreastCancer. DTC in the BM were detected in 107/502 (21%) patients and no
correlation was found between BM status and CTC positivity (P = 0.41). The
presence of CTC, EMT and ALDH1 expression was not correlated to any of the
prognostic clinical markers.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that (1) a subset of primary breast cancer
patients shows EMT and stem cell characteristics and (2) the currently used
detection methods for CTC are not efficient to identify a subtype of CTC which
underwent EMT. (3) The clinical relevance on prognosis and therapy response has
to be further evaluated in a prospective trial.

Proinflammatory cytokines produced in the tumor microenvironment facilitate tumor
development and metastatic progression. In particular, TNF-a promotes cancer
invasion and angiogenesis associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT); however, the mechanisms underlying its induction of EMT in cancer cells
remain unclear. Here we show that EMT and cancer stemness properties induced by
chronic treatment with TNF-a are mediated by the upregulation of the
transcriptional repressor Twist1. Exposure to TNF-a rapidly induced Twist1 mRNA
and protein expression in normal breast epithelial and breast cancer cells. Both 
IKK-ß and NF-<U+03BA>B p65 were required for TNF-a-induced expression of Twist1,
suggesting the involvement of canonical NF-<U+03BA>B signaling. In support of this
likelihood, we defined a functional NF-<U+03BA>B-binding site in the Twist1 promoter,
and overexpression of p65 was sufficient to induce transcriptional upregulation
of Twist1 along with EMT in mammary epithelial cells. Conversely, suppressing
Twist1 expression abrogated p65-induced cell migration, invasion, EMT, and
stemness properties, establishing that Twist1 is required for NF-<U+03BA>B to induce
these aggressive phenotypes in breast cancer cells. Taken together, our results
establish a signaling axis through which the tumor microenvironment elicits
Twist1 expression to promote cancer metastasis. We suggest that targeting
NF-<U+03BA>B-mediated Twist1 upregulation may offer an effective a therapeutic strategy 
for breast cancer treatment.

Wnt signalling is an important component of vertebrate development, required for 
specification of the neural crest. Ten Wnt receptors [Frizzled receptor 1-10
(Fzd1-10)] have been identified so far, some of which are expressed in the
developing nervous system and the neural crest. Here we show that expression of
one such receptors, Fzd6, predicts poor survival in neuroblastoma patients and
marks rare, HIF1/2 a-positive cells in tumour hypoxic areas. Fzd6 positive
neuroblastoma cells form neurospheres with high efficiency, are resistant to
doxorubicin killing and express high levels of mesenchymal markers such as Twist1
and Notch1. Expression of Fzd6 is required for the expression of genes of the
non-canonical Wnt pathway and the spheres forming activity. When transplanted
into immunodeficient mice, neuroblastoma cells expressing the Fzd6 marker grow
more aggressively than their Fzd6 negative counterparts. We conclude that Fzd6 is
a new surface marker of aggressive neuroblastoma cells with stem cell-like
features.

Studies of human diseased aortic valves have demonstrated increased expression of
genetic markers of valve progenitors and osteogenic differentiation associated
with pathogenesis. Three potential mouse models of valve disease were examined
for cellular pathology, morphology, and induction of valvulogenic, chondrogenic, 
and osteogenic markers. Osteogenesis imperfecta murine (Oim) mice, with a
mutation in Col1a2, have distal leaflet thickening and increased proteoglycan
composition characteristic of myxomatous valve disease. Periostin null mice also 
exhibit dysregulation of the ECM with thickening in the aortic midvalve region,
but do not have an overall increase in valve leaflet surface area. Klotho null
mice are a model for premature aging and exhibit calcific nodules in the aortic
valve hinge-region, but do not exhibit leaflet thickening, ECM disorganization,
or inflammation. Oim/oim mice have increased expression of valve progenitor
markers Twist1, Col2a1, Mmp13, Sox9 and Hapln1, in addition to increased Col10a1 
and Asporin expression, consistent with increased proteoglycan composition.
Periostin null aortic valves exhibit relatively normal gene expression with
slightly increased expression of Mmp13 and Hapln1. In contrast, Klotho null
aortic valves have increased expression of Runx2, consistent with the calcified
phenotype, in addition to increased expression of Sox9, Col10a1, and osteopontin.
Together these studies demonstrate that oim/oim mice exhibit histological and
molecular characteristics of myxomatous valve disease and Klotho null mice are a 
new model for calcific aortic valve disease.

Short hairpin RNA targeting Twist1 suppresses cell proliferation and improves
chemosensitivity to cisplatin in HeLa human cervical cancer cells.

Development of multidrug resistance (MDR) remains a major hurdle to successful
cancer chemotherapy and MDR1/P-gp overexpression is believed to be mainly
responsible for MDR of tumor cells. Twist1, which is a highly conserved
transcription factor that belongs to the family of basic helix-loop-helix
proteins, has been shown to be a major regulator of the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), and therefore promotes carcinoma metastasis. Recently, a novel 
function of Twist1 was reported to confer radioresistance or chemoresistance in
cervical cancer. However, mechanisms of such efficacy are not completely
elucidated. In the present study, we firstly analyzed the relationship between
Twist1 and MDR1/P-gp expression in human cervical cancer specimens and
demonstrated a positive correlation between Twist1 and MDR1/P-gp expression in
the same patient. Additionally, we provide the first evidence that silencing of
Twist1 by RNAi downregulated MDR1/P-gp expression in HeLa cervical cancer cells, 
suppressed the cell proliferation, inhibited Rhodamine123 efflux activity of
cells and sensitized cells to cisplatin treatment. Collectively, these <U+FB01>ndings
suggest that Twist1-mediated modulation of MDR1/P-gp expression plays an
important role in sensitization of cervical cancer cells to cisplatin, and also
indicate a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome drug resistance through
inactivation of Twist1 expression in cervical cancer.

Twist1 directly regulates genes that promote cell proliferation and migration in 
developing heart valves.

Lee MP(1), Yutzey KE.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Molecular Cardiovascular Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital
Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America.

Twist1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is expressed in
mesenchymal precursor populations during embryogenesis and in metastatic cancer
cells. In the developing heart, Twist1 is highly expressed in endocardial cushion
(ECC) valve mesenchymal cells and is down regulated during valve differentiation 
and remodeling. Previous studies demonstrated that Twist1 promotes cell
proliferation, migration, and expression of primitive extracellular matrix (ECM) 
molecules in ECC mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, Twist1 expression is induced in 
human pediatric and adult diseased heart valves. However, the Twist1 downstream
target genes that mediate increased cell proliferation and migration during early
heart valve development remain largely unknown. Candidate gene and global gene
profiling approaches were used to identify transcriptional targets of Twist1
during heart valve development. Candidate target genes were analyzed for
evolutionarily conserved regions (ECRs) containing E-box consensus sequences that
are potential Twist1 binding sites. ECRs containing conserved E-box sequences
were identified for Twist1 responsive genes Tbx20, Cdh11, Sema3C, Rab39b, and
Gadd45a. Twist1 binding to these sequences in vivo was determined by chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, and binding was detected in ECCs but not late 
stage remodeling valves. In addition identified Twist1 target genes are highly
expressed in ECCs and have reduced expression during heart valve remodeling in
vivo, which is consistent with the expression pattern of Twist1. Together these
analyses identify multiple new genes involved in cell proliferation and migration
that are differentially expressed in the developing heart valves, are responsive 
to Twist1 transcriptional function, and contain Twist1-responsive regulatory
sequences.

Deciphering molecular mechanisms that control epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) contributes to our understanding of how tumor cells become
invasive and competent for intravasation. We have established that transforming
growth factor ß activates Smad proteins, which induce expression of the embryonic
factor high mobility group A2 (HMGA2), which causes mesenchymal transition. HMGA2
associates with Smad complexes and induces expression of an established regulator
of EMT, the zinc finger transcription factor Snail. We now show that HMGA2 can
also induce expression of a second regulator of EMT, the basic helix-loop-helix
transcription factor Twist. Silencing of endogenous Twist demonstrated that this 
protein acts in a partially redundant manner together with Snail. Double
silencing of Snail and Twist reverts mesenchymal HMGA2-expressing cells to a more
epithelial phenotype when compared with single silencing of Snail or Twist.
Furthermore, HMGA2 can directly associate with A:T-rich sequences and promote
transcription from the Twist promoter. The new evidence proposes a model whereby 
HMGA2 directly induces multiple transcriptional regulators of the EMT program
and, thus, is a potential biomarker for carcinomas displaying EMT during
progression to more advanced stages of malignancy.

Evidence that GTP-binding domain but not catalytic domain of transglutaminase 2
is essential for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in mammary epithelial
cells.

INTRODUCTION: The expression of proinflammatory protein tissue transglutaminase 2
(TG2) is frequently upregulated in multiple cancer cell types. However, the exact
role of TG2 in cancer cells is not well-understood. We recently initiated studies
to determine the significance of TG2 in cancer cells and observed that sustained 
expression of TG2 resulted in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
promoted cancer stem cell (CSC) traits in mammary epithelial cells. These results
suggested that TG2 could serve as a promising therapeutic target for overcoming
chemoresistance and inhibiting metastatic spread of cancer cells.
METHODS: Using various mutant constructs, we analyzed the activity of TG2 that is
essential for promoting the EMT-CSC phenotype.
RESULTS: Our results suggest that catalytically inactive TG2 (TG2-C277S) is as
effective as wild-type TG2 (TG2-WT) in inducing the EMT-CSC in mammary epithelial
cells. In contrast, overexpression of a GTP-binding-deficient mutant (TG2-R580A) 
was completely incompetent in this regard. Moreover, TG2-dependent activation of 
the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-<U+03BA>B is deemed essential for promoting 
the EMT-CSC phenotype in mammary epithelial cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the transamidation activity of TG2 is not
essential for promoting its oncogenic functions and provide a strong rationale
for developing small-molecule inhibitors to block GTP-binding pockets of TG2.
Such inhibitors may have great potential for inhibiting the TG2-regulated
pathways, reversing drug resistance and inhibiting the metastasis of cancer
cells.

Rapamycin prevents endothelial cell migration by inhibiting the
endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9: an
in vitro study.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the influence of rapamycin on endothelial-mesenchymal
transition and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion by human umbilical vein
endothelial cell line EA.hy926 and explore rapamycin's angiogenesis inhibition
mechanism.
METHODS: EA.hy926 cells were cultivated in vitro. After the cells attained
complete confluency, an artificial scratch was made through the monolayer with a 
sterile plastic 100 µl micropipette tip. Cell morphology changes were observed.
The expression of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, vimentin, and Twist protein
were examined by immunofluorescence. After scratching, the cells were treated
with 10, 100, and 1,000 ng/ml rapamycin for durations of 24, 48, and 72 h. Cell
proliferation was then assessed using methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay. Cell
migration ability was examined, and the expression of VE-cadherin, vimentin, and 
the Twist transcription factor in mRNA levels was evaluated with reverse
transcriptase PCR. The expression of gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) was examined
using gelatin zymography.
RESULTS: After scratching, the endothelial cells were able to migrate via an
endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, which was related to Twist expression.
Finally, mesenchymal cells transitioned into endothelial cells and reached cell
confluency again. The growth of EA.hy926 cells was not affected by rapamycin
concentrations of 10 ng/ml or 100 ng/ml during treatment periods of 1, 2, and 3
days; however, cell growth was inhibited by 1,000 ng/ml rapamycin with a
three-day treatment period. Rapamycin successfully inhibited cell migration at
concentrations of 10 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml, and 1,000 ng/ml for a treatment period of 
up to 8 h. Different concentrations of rapamycin induced the expression of
VE-cadherin, inhibited vimentin and Twist expression in the endothelial cells,
and inhibited endothelial cell secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9.
CONCLUSIONS: Rapamycin inhibited cell migration and extracellular matrix
degradation by inhibiting endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and the
endothelial cell secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9; these may be possible mechanisms
for the inhibition of angiogenesis by rapamycin.

A noninvasive multi-analyte diagnostic assay: combining protein and DNA markers
to stratify bladder cancer patients.

Fernandez CA(1), Millholland JM, Zwarthoff EC, Feldman AS, Karnes RJ, Shuber AP.

Author information: 
(1)Predictive Biosciences, Inc, Lexington, MA, USA.

PURPOSE: The authors recently reported the development of a noninvasive
diagnostic assay using urinary matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) as monitors of
disease-free status and bladder cancer in high-risk populations. Using an
approach called clinical intervention determining diagnostic (CIDD), they
identified with high confidence those patients who could be excluded from
additional intervention. To maximize performance, MMPs were combined with
DNA-based markers and CIDD was applied to a population of patients undergoing
monitoring for recurrence.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Urine samples were obtained from 323 patients, 48 of whom
had a recurrence and 275 of whom did not have cancer upon cytoscopic evaluation. 
Twist1 and Nid2 methylation status was determined using methylation-specific
polymerase chain reaction, FGFR3 mutational status by quantitative PCR, and MMP
levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Using a combination of these DNA and protein markers, the authors
identified with high confidence (97% negative predicted value) those patients who
do not have cancer. Cutoffs were adjusted such that at 92% sensitivity, 51% of
disease-free patients might be triaged from receiving further tests.
CONCLUSION: The multi-analyte diagnostic readout assay described here is the
first to combine protein and DNA biomarkers into one assay for optimal clinical
performance. Using this approach, the detection of FGFR3 mutations and Twist1 and
Nid2 methylation in the urine of patients undergoing bladder cancer recurrence
screening increase the sensitivity and negative predictive value at an
established MMP protein cutoff. This noninvasive urinary diagnostic assay could
lead to the more efficient triage of patients undergoing recurrence monitoring.

The discovery of translocations that involve one of the genes of the ETS family
(ERG, ETV1, ETV4 and ETV5) has been a major advance in understanding the
molecular basis of prostate cancer (PC). Each one of these translocations results
in deregulated expression of one of the ETS proteins. Here, we focus on the
mechanism whereby overexpression of the ETV4 gene mediates oncogenesis in the
prostate. By siRNA technology, we show that ETV4 inhibition in the PC3 cancer
cell line reduces not only cell mobility and anchorage-independent growth, but
also cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and tumor growth in a xenograft
model. Conversely, ETV4 overexpression in the nonmalignant human prostate cell
line (RWPE) increases anchorage-independent growth, cell mobility and cell
proliferation, which is probably mediated by downregulation of p21, producing
accelerated progression through the cell cycle. ETV4 overexpression is associated
with changes in the pattern of E-cadherin and N-cadherin expression; the cells
also become spindle-shaped, and these changes are characteristic of the so-called
epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). In RWPE cells overexpressing ETV4 EMT
results from a marked increase in EMT-specific transcription factors such as
TWIST1, SLUG1, ZEB1 and ZEB2. Thus, whereas ETV4 shares with the other ETS
proteins (ERG, ETV5 and ETV1) a major role in invasiveness and cell migration, it
emerges as unique in that it increases at the same time also the rate of
proliferation of PC cells. Considering the wide spectrum in the clinical course
of patients with PC, it may be highly relevant that ETV4 is capable of inducing
most and perhaps all of the features that make a tumor aggressive.

Breast cancer is a group of clinically, histopathologically and molecularly
heterogeneous diseases, with different outcomes and responses to treatment.
Triple-negative (TN) breast cancers are defined as tumors that lack the
expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and epidermal growth
factor receptor 2. This subgroup accounts for 15% of all types of breast cancer
and its prevalence is higher among young African, African-American and Latino
women. The hypermethylation of CpG islands (CpGI) is a common epigenetic
alteration for suppressing gene expression in breast cancer and has been shown to
be a key factor in breast carcinogenesis. In this study we analyzed the
hypermethylation of 110 CpGI within 69 cancer-related genes in TN tumors. For the
methylation analysis, we used the methyl-specific multiplex-ligation probe
amplification assay. We found that the number of methylated CpGI is similar
between TN and non-TN tumors, but the methylated genes between the groups are
different. The methylation profile of TN tumors is defined by the methylation of 
five genes (that is, CDKN2B, CD44, MGMT, RB and p73) plus the non-methylation of 
11 genes (that is, GSTP1, PMS2, MSH2, MLH1, MSH3, MSH6, DLC1, CACNA1A, CACNA1G,
TWIST1 and ID4). We conclude that TN tumors have a specific methylation profile. 
Our findings give new information for better understanding tumor etiology and
encourage future studies on potential drug targets for triple-negative breast
tumors, which now lack a specific treatment.

Axin pathway activity regulates in vivo pY654-ß-catenin accumulation and
pulmonary fibrosis.

Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and pulmonary fibrogenesis require
epithelial integrin a3ß1-mediated cross-talk between TGFß1 and Wnt signaling
pathways. One hallmark of this cross-talk is pY654-ß-catenin accumulation, but
whether pY654-ß-catenin is a biomarker of fibrogenesis or functionally important 
is unknown. To clarify further the role of ß-catenin in fibrosis, we explored
pY654-ß-catenin generation and function. a3ß1 was required for TGFß1-mediated
activation of Src family kinases, and Src inhibition blocked both pY654 and EMT
in primary alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). TGFß1 stimulated
ß-catenin/Lef1-dependent promoter activity comparably in immortalized AECs stably
expressing WT ß-catenin as well as Y654E or Y654F ß-catenin point mutants. But
EMT was abrogated in the Tyr to Phe mutant. pY654-ß-catenin was sensitive to the 
axin ß-catenin turnover pathway as inhibition of tankyrase 1 led to high AEC axin
levels, loss of pY654-ß-catenin, and inhibition of EMT ex vivo. Mice given a
tankyrase inhibitor (50 mg/kg orally) daily for 7 days beginning 10 days after
intratracheal bleomycin had improved survival over controls. Treated mice
developed raised axin levels in the lung that abrogated pY654-ß-catenin and
attenuated lung Snail1, Twist1, a-smooth muscle actin, and type I collagen
accumulation. Total ß-catenin levels were unaltered. These findings identify Src 
kinase(s) as a mediator of TGFß1-induced pY654-ß-catenin, provide evidence that
pY654-ß-catenin levels are a critical determinant of EMT and fibrogenesis, and
suggest regulation of axin levels as a novel therapeutic approach to fibrotic
disorders.

cell carcinomas.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are a heterogeneous group of
tumors with variable presentation and clinical behavior. Despite improvements in 
surgical and radiation therapy techniques, the 5-year survival rate has not
improved significantly over the past decades. Thus, there is an urgent need to
identify novel markers that may allow for the development of personalized
therapeutic approaches. In the present study we evaluated the prognostic role of 
the expression of genes related to the induction of epithelial mesenchymal
transition (EMT). To this aim, a consecutive series of 69 HNSCC were analyzed for
the expression of TWIST1, TWIST2, SNAI1, SNAI2, E-Cadherin, N-Cadherin and
Vimentin.TWIST1, TWIST2, SNAI1 and SNAI2 were significantly overexpressed in
HNSCC, with TWIST2, SNAI1 and SNAI2 being more markedly increased in tumors
compared to normal mucosae. The expression of TWIST1 and SNAI2 was associated
with upregulation of mesenchymal markers, but failed to correlate with
pathological parameters or clinical behaviour. In contrast, we found that
upregulation of TWIST2, which was independent of the activation of a mesenchymal 
differentiation program, correlated with poor differentiation grade (p=0.016) and
shorter survival (p=0.025), and identifies a subset of node-positive oral
cavity/pharynx cancer patients with very poor prognosis (p less than 0.001).
Overall our study suggests that the assessment of TWIST2 expression might help to
stratify HNSCC patients for risk of disease progression, pointing to TWIST2 as a 
potential prognostic marker.

The dynamic nature of cancer stem cells that underlie metastasis or their ability
to switch between different cellular identities, as in EMT and MET, has profound 
implications for cancer therapy. The functional relationship between molecules
involved in cancer cell stemness and metastasis is not clear. In this regard, our
studies on hGBM tissue grade IV specimens showed significant expression of Twist1
and Sox2, known mesenchymal and stemness related markers, respectively,
indicating their association with glial tumor genesis and metastasis. The glioma 
stem cells obtained from CD133+ cells demonstrated increased expression of Twist1
and Sox2 accompanied by significant increase in the mesenchymal markers such as
N-cadherin, vimentin and ß-catenin. Our studies on glioma stem cells treatment
with human umbilical cord blood derived- mesenchymal stem cells, showed down
regulation of Twist1 and Sox2 proteins, apart from other mesenchymal stem cell
markers. Based on the in vitro experiments and in vivo intracranial xenograft
mouse model studies, we elucidated the potential therapeutic role of hUCBSC in
suppressing glioma cancer stemness by the induction of MET.

Prognostic role of Twist, Slug, and Foxc2 expression in stage I non-small-cell
lung cancer after curative resection.

Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.

By using immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays of 137 cases, we evaluated
the prognostic power of a 3-marker epithelial-mesenchymal transitionrelated
model in patients with stage I non-small-cell lung cancer who underwent radical
surgical resection. The Twist/Slug/Foxc2 coexpression model accurately
prognosticated these patients and may be helpful in refining current treatment
strategy for stage I non-small-cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the
leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. Only about 60% of patients
with stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can be cured by surgery alone.
Current clinical and molecular markers are inadequate prognosticators. We
developed a 3-marker model that closely approximates survival probability of
patients with stage I NSCLC.
METHODS: Expression of Twist, Slug, and Foxc2 was assessed by
immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays that contained paired tumor and
peritumoral lung tissue from 137 patients who underwent surgical resection for
stage I NSCLC. The prognostic value of Twist, Slug, and Foxc2, and the cumulative
effects of the 3 markers on survival were evaluated.
RESULTS: Increased expression of Twist, Slug, and Foxc2 was observed in 38.0%,
18.2%, and 27.7% of primary tumors, respectively. Overexpression of Twist, Slug, 
and Foxc2 in stage I NSCLC was associated with a worse overall survival (P =
.001, P = .002, P < .001, respectively) and correlated with a shorter
recurrence-free survival (P < .001, P = .001, P < .001 respectively). The
cumulative influence of these markers on outcome was analyzed; a combination of
more than 2 positive markers was an independent predictor of recurrence-free and 
overall survival (P = .002 and P = .009, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The Twist/Slug/Foxc2 model is useful in predicting survival of stage
I NSCLC and may be helpful in refining current treatment strategy.

Regionalized Twist1 activity in the forelimb bud drives the morphogenesis of the 
proximal and preaxial skeleton.

Development of the mouse forelimb bud depends on normal Twist1 activity. Global
loss of Twist1 function before limb bud formation stops limb development and loss
of Twist1 throughout the mesenchyme after limb bud initiation leads to
polydactyly, the ulnarization or loss of the radius and malformations and
reductions of the shoulder girdle. Here we show that conditional deletion of
Twist1 by Mesp1-Cre in the mesoderm that migrates into the anterior-proximal part
of the forelimb bud results in the development of supernumerary digits and
carpals, the acquisition of ulna-like characteristics by the radius and
malformations of the humerus and scapula. The mirror-like duplications and
posteriorization of pre-axial tissues are preceded by disruptions to
anterior-posterior Shh, Bmp and Fgf signaling gradients and dysregulation of
transcription factors that regulate anterior-posterior limb patterning.

prevents conversion from androgen dependent to castration resistant prostate
cancer.

PURPOSE: Prostate cancer progression from androgen dependence to castration
resistance results at least in part from oxidative stress induced by androgen
deprivation therapy. We elucidated the state and the role of oxidative stress
induced by androgen deprivation therapy and the possibility of antioxidant
therapy in human prostate cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated 4-HNE (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal histidine
adduct) staining, and Twist1, YB-1 and androgen receptor expression by
immunohistochemistry in prostate cancer samples treated with or without
neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy. Intracellular reactive oxygen species
and protein expression were examined by CM-H(2)DCFDA and Western blot analysis,
respectively. A cell proliferation assay and a mouse xenograft model were used to
assess tumor growth.
RESULTS: Androgen deprivation therapy increased oxidative stress, as shown by
4-HNE staining in human prostate cancer tissue. Twist1 and YB-1 expression was
up-regulated by androgen deprivation, resulting in androgen receptor over
expression. In LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells androgen deprivation increased intracellular
reactive oxygen species and evoked Twist1, YB-1 and androgen receptor over
expression, resulting in cell growth in a castration resistant manner. Growth was
alleviated by N-acetyl-cysteine, an electrophile that supports glutathione
production. N-acetyl-cysteine also decreased LNCaP and 22Rv1 tumor growth in
castrated and noncastrated mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Androgen deprivation therapy induced oxidative stress in in vitro
and human prostate cancer. Antioxidant therapy using N-acetyl-cysteine appears to
be a promising therapeutic modality for prostate cancer.

Twist modulates human trophoblastic cell invasion via regulation of N-cadherin.

Ng YH(1), Zhu H, Leung PC.

(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of British Columbia,
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6H 3V5.

The invasion of extravillous cytotrophoblasts (EVT) into the underlying maternal 
tissues and vasculature is a key step in human placentation. The molecular
mechanisms involved in the development of the invasive phenotype of EVT include
many that were first discovered for their role in cancer cell metastasis.
Previous studies have demonstrated that N-cadherin and its regulatory
transcription factor Twist play important roles in the onset and progression of
cancers, but their roles in human trophoblastic cell invasion is not clear. The
goal of the study was to examine the role of Twist and N-cadherin in human
trophoblastic cell invasion. Twist and N-cadherin mRNA and protein levels were
determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting in human placental tissues, highly
invasive EVT, and poorly invasive JEG-3 and BeWo cells. Whether IL-1ß and TGF-ß1 
regulate Twist mRNA and protein levels in the EVT was also examined. A small
interfering RNA strategy was employed to determine the role of Twist and
N-cadherin in HTR-8/SVneo cell invasion. Matrigel assays were used to assess cell
invasion. Twist and N-cadherin were highly expressed in EVT but were poorly
expressed in JEG-3 and BeWo cells. IL-1ß and TGF-ß1 differentially regulated
Twist expression in EVT in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Small
interfering RNA specific for Twist decreased N-cadherin and reduced invasion of
HTR-8/SVneo cells. Similarly, a reduction in N-cadherin decreased the invasive
capacity of HTR-8/SVneo cells. Twist is an upstream regulator of
N-cadherin-mediated invasion of human trophoblastic cells.

Expression of mesenchymal-related genes by the bovine trophectoderm following
conceptus attachment to the endometrial epithelium.

Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.

In the course of experiments to identify and characterize the factors that
function in bovine conceptuses during peri-attachment periods, various
transcripts related to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were found. In
this study, RNA was extracted from different sets of days 17, 20, and 22 (day
0=day of estrous) bovine conceptuses and subjected to real-time PCR analysis as
well as Western blotting, from which abundances of N-cadherin (CDH2), vimentin,
matrix metalloproteinase 2 (gelatinase A, 72 kDa gelatinase, 72 kDa type IV
collagenase) (MMP2), and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (gelatinase B, 92 kDa
gelatinase, 92 kDa type IV collagenase) (MMP9) mRNAs were determined on day 22,
concurrent with (CDH1) mRNA and protein downregulation. Transcription factors in 
EMT processes were then analyzed and changes in snail homolog 2 (Drosophila)
(SNAI), zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), zinc finger E-box binding
homeobox 2 (ZEB2), twist homolog 1 (Drosophila) (TWIST1), twist homolog 2
(Drosophila) (TWIST2), and Kruppel-like factor 8 (KLF8) transcripts were found in
day 22 conceptuses, while confirming SNAI2 expression by Western blotting.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the day 22 trophectoderm expressed the
mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin as well as the epithelial marker
cytokeratin. In attempts to identify the molecular mechanisms by which the
trophectoderm expressed EMT-related genes, growth factor receptors associated
with EMT were analyzed. Upregulation of the growth factor receptor transcripts,
fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), platelet-derived growth factor
receptor, alpha polypeptide (PDGFRA), platelet-derived growth factor receptor,
beta polypeptide (PDGFRB), and transforming growth factor, beta receptor II
(70/80 kDa) (TGFBR2) mRNAs, was found on day 22. The analysis was extended to
determine the integrin (ITG) transcripts and found high levels of integrin, alpha
4 (antigen CD49D, alpha 4 subunit of VLA-4 receptor) (ITGA4), integrin, alpha 8
(ITGA8), integrin, beta 3 (platelet glycoprotein IIIa, antigen CD61) (ITGB3), and
integrin, beta 5 (ITGB5) mRNAs on day 22. These observations indicate that after 
the conceptus-endometrium attachment, EMT-related transcripts as well as the
epithelial marker cytokeratin were present in the bovine trophectoderm and
suggest that the implantation process for noninvasive trophoblasts requires not
only extracellular matrix expression but also partial EMT.

Aberrant expression of the transcriptional factor Twist1 promotes invasiveness in
ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

China Medical University, Shen Yang 110001, PR China.

The transcriptional factor Twist1 has been shown to play a key role in regulating
epithelial mesenchymal transition, invasiveness and migratory properties in solid
tumors. We found that Twist1 is aberrantly expressed in ALK-positive anaplastic
large cell lymphoma (ALK+ALCL), a type of T-cell lymphoid malignancy. Using
RT-PCR and Western blots, Twist1 was detectable in all 3 ALK+ALCL cell lines
examined but absent in normal T-cells. By immunohistochemistry, Twist1 was
detectable in all 10 cases of ALK+ALCL examined; benign lymphoid tissues were
consistently negative. Twist1 expression in ALK+ALCL cells can be attributed to
the NPM-ALK/STAT3 signaling axis, the key oncogenic driving force in this tumor
type. Twist1 is biologically important in ALK+ALCL cells, as Twist1 knockdown
resulted in a significant decrease in their invasiveness in an in-vitro assay.
Further investigation revealed that this increase in invasiveness is linked to
the activation of AKT and down-regulation of p66Shc, two signaling proteins known
to be involved in NPM-ALK-mediated oncogenesis. Lastly, knockdown of Twist1
sensitizes ALK+ALCL cells to the growth inhibitory effect of PF-2341066
(Crizotinib®), an ALK inhibitor being used in clinical trials. In conclusion,
Twist1 expression, owing to the abnormal NPM-ALK/STAT3 signaling, contributes to 
its invasiveness and decreased sensitivity to PF-2341066 in ALK+ALCL.

Genes involved in the immediate early response and epithelial-mesenchymal
transition are regulated by adipocytokines in the female reproductive tract.

Yang Z(1), Norwood KA, Smith JE, Kerl JG, Wood JR.

(1)Department of Animal Science, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln,
Nebraska 68583-0908, USA.

Obesity increases the risk of female reproductive tract cancers, but the
underlying mechanistic link between the two is ill-defined. Thus, the objective
of the current study was to identify obesity-dependent changes in the expression 
of immediate early (IE) genes that contribute to cell proliferation and
differentiation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes that promote
cell migration. When HeLa cells were treated for 0-48<U+2009>hr with IGF-1, leptin,
TNFa, or IL-6, each individual adipocytokine altered the abundance of IE (cJUN,
cFOS, and cMYC) and EMT (SNAI1, SNAI2, and TWIST1) mRNA abundance. For example,
IGF-1 increased cJUN and cFOS and decreased cMYC; leptin increased cFOS; IL-6
increased cFOS and cMYC; and TNFa increased cJUN and cFOS mRNA abundance.
Likewise, EMT gene expression was altered by IGF-1, TNFa, and IL-6. SNAI1 was
increased by IGF-1 and IL-6; SNAI2 was increased by IGF-1 and TNFa; and TWIST1
was increased by TNFa and IL-6. Chronic exposure to adipocytokines also altered
EMT gene expression in the whole uterus of obese compared to normal-weight mice. 
Specifically, there was no difference in cJun, cFos, or cMyc mRNA abundance
between normal-weight and obese animals. Snai1, Snai2, and Twist1 mRNA abundance,
however, was increased in the uterus of obese females and correlated with
increased circulating IGF-1 levels. These data indicate that obesity-dependent
alterations in adipocytokine levels regulate the expression of genes associated
with cell proliferation and migration, and therefore may provide a plausible
mechanism for obesity-dependent increases in cancers of the female reproductive
tract.

TWIST is a transcription factor expressed during early embryonic development. In 
this study we investigate the expression of TWIST during human muscle
development. Human TWIST was found to be endogenously expressed in human fetal
myoblasts, and its expression decreased during late stages of development.
Myoblasts showed an increasing capacity to differentiate in vitro during
development. This inversely proportional relation between TWIST and
differentiation capacity of myoblasts suggests that TWIST is involved in the
regulation of muscle development.

The epigenetic modifier PRDM5 functions as a tumor suppressor through modulating 
WNT/ß-catenin signaling and is frequently silenced in multiple tumors.

University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.

BACKGROUND: PRDM (PRDI-BF1 and RIZ domain containing) proteins are zinc finger
proteins involved in multiple cellular regulations by acting as epigenetic
modifiers. We studied a recently identified PRDM member PRDM5 for its epigenetic 
abnormality and tumor suppressive functions in multiple tumorigeneses.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that PRDM5 was
broadly expressed in human normal tissues, but frequently silenced or
downregulated in multiple carcinoma cell lines due to promoter CpG methylation,
including 80% (4/5) nasopharyngeal, 44% (8/18) esophageal, 76% (13/17) gastric,
50% (2/4) cervical, and 25% (3/12) hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, but not
in any immortalized normal epithelial cell lines. PRDM5 expression could be
restored by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine demethylation treatment in silenced cell
lines. PRDM5 methylation was frequently detected by methylation-specific PCR
(MSP) in multiple primary tumors, including 93% (43/46) nasopharyngeal, 58%
(25/43) esophageal, 88% (37/42) gastric and 63% (29/46) hepatocellular tumors.
PRDM5 was further found a stress-responsive gene, but its response was impaired
when the promoter was methylated. Ectopic PRDM5 expression significantly
inhibited tumor cell clonogenicity, accompanied by the inhibition of
TCF/ß-catenin-dependent transcription and downregulation of CDK4, TWIST1 and MDM2
oncogenes, while knocking down of PRDM5 expression lead to increased cell
proliferation. ChIP assay showed that PRDM5 bound to its target gene promoters
and suppressed their transcription. An inverse correlation between the expression
of PRDM5 and activated ß-catenin was also observed in cell lines.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: PRDM5 functions as a tumor suppressor at least
partially through antagonizing aberrant WNT/ß-catenin signaling and oncogene
expression. Frequent epigenetic silencing of PRDM5 is involved in multiple
tumorigeneses, which could serve as a tumor biomarker.

runx2 in zebrafish.

BACKGROUND: Twist1a and twist1b are the principal components of twists that
negatively regulate a number of cellular signaling events. Expression of runx2
and downstream targets is essential for skeletal development and ventral
organizer formation and specification in early vertebrate embryos, but what
controls ventral activity of maternal runx2 and how twists function in zebrafish 
embryogenesis still remain unclear.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By studying the loss of twist induced by
injection of morpholino-oligonucleotide in zebrafish, we found that twist1a and
twist1b, but not twist2 or twist3, were required for proper skeletal development 
and dorsoventral patterning in early embryos. Overexpression of twist1a or
twist1b following mRNA injection resulted in deteriorated skeletal development
and formation of typical dorsalized embryos, whereas knockdown of twist1a and
twist1b led to the formation of abnormal embryos with enhanced skeletal formation
and typical ventralized patterning. Overexpression of twist1a or twist1b
decreased the expression of runx2b, whereas twist1a and twist1b knockdown
increased runx2b expression. We have further demonstrated that phenotypes induced
by twist1a and twist1b knockdown were rescued by runx2b knockdown.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Together, these results suggest that twist1a and
twist1b control skeletal development and dorsoventral patterning by regulating
runx2b in zebrafish and provide potential targets for the treatment of diseases
or syndromes associated with decreased skeletal development.

E-cadherin (E-CD) inactivation with loss of E-CD-mediated cell adhesion is the
hallmark of lesions of the lobular phenotype. E-CD is typically absent by
immunohistochemistry in both lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and invasive
lobular lesions, suggesting it occurs early in the neoplastic process. In
laboratory models, downstream post-transcriptional modifiers such as TWIST and
SNAIL contribute to the dissociation of the intracellular component of the
cadherin-catenin complex (CCC), resulting in tumor progression and invasion. We
hypothesized that complete CCC dissociation may play a role in lobular neoplasia 
progression. Here we explore the relationship between loss of E-CD and
dissociation of the CCC in pure LCIS and LCIS associated with invasive cancer.
Fresh-frozen tissues were obtained from 36 patients undergoing mastectomy for
pure LCIS (n = 11), LCIS with ILC (n = 18) or LCIS with IDC (n = 7). Individual
lesions were subject to laser-capture microdissection and gene-expression
analysis (Affymetrix HG-U133A 2.0). Immunohistochemistry for ER,PR,HER2,
E-CD,N-CD,a-,ß-, and phosphoß-catenin, TWIST, and SNAIL were evaluated in normal,
in situ, and invasive components from matched formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
samples (n = 36). CCC-dissociation was defined as negative membranous E-CD, a-
and ß-catenin expression. E-CD was negative in all LCIS and ILC lesions, and
positive in all normal and IDC lesions. Membranous a and ß-catenin expressions
decreased with the transition from LCIS to ILC (pure LCIS 82%; LCIS w/ILC 28%;
ILC 0%), while TWIST expression increased (pure LCIS low; LCIS w/ILC moderate;
ILC high). Gene expression paralleled IHC-staining patterns with a stepwise
downregulation of E-CD, a and ß-catenins from normal to LCIS to invasive lesions,
and increasing expression of TWIST from normal to LCIS to ILC. Loss of E-CD
expression is an early event in lobular neoplasia. Decreasing membranous catenin 
expression in tandem with increasing levels of TWIST across the spectrum of
lobular lesions suggests that CCC dissociation is a progressive process.

ARTEMIN synergizes with TWIST1 to promote metastasis and poor survival outcome in
patients with ER negative mammary carcinoma.

INTRODUCTION: ARTEMIN (ARTN) is an estrogen regulated growth factor, the
expression of which promotes resistance to antiestrogen therapies and predicts
poorer survival outcome of patients with estrogen receptor (ER) positive mammary 
carcinoma (ER+MC) treated with tamoxifen. ARTN is also expressed in ER negative
mammary carcinoma (ER-MC). Herein, we determined the role of ARTN in ER-MC and
defined the mechanism of action producing poor patient prognosis.
METHODS: We modulated the expression of ARTN in two ER- (mesenchymal/claudin-low)
mammary carcinoma cell lines (BT549 and MDA-MB-231) by forced expression or small
interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated depletion. The effects of modulation of ARTN
expression were examined by various in vitro measures of oncogenicity, including 
the expression of TWIST1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein. In vitro results were 
correlated to xenograft studies in immunodeficient mice. Co-expression of ARTN
and TWIST1 and their association to poor survival outcome were examined in a
cohort of patients with ER-MC. Pathway analysis was performed by pharmacological 
inhibition of phosphorylation of AKT (pAKT-Ser 473) or modulation of TWIST1
expression.
RESULTS: ARTN expression resulted in ER-MC cells with enhanced mesenchymal
characteristics, including increased invasion and a gene expression profile
consistent with enhanced mesenchymal phenotype. ARTN stimulated ER-MC cell
anchorage independent and 3D matrigel growth, endothelial cell adhesion and
transmigration of ER-MC cells through an endothelial cell barrier. Forced
expression of ARTN produced a larger, locally invasive tumour mass with tumour
emboli that produced distant metastasis. ARTN regulated TWIST1 expression in
ER-MC cells and ARTN expression was significantly correlated to TWIST1 expression
in a panel of mammary carcinoma cell lines and in a cohort of patients with
ER-MC. Low expression of both ARTN and TWIST1 predicted 100% relapse free and
overall survival in patients with ER-MC, whereas high expression of both ARTN and
TWIST1 was associated with a poor survival outcome. ARTN stimulated an increase
in TWIST1 expression via increased AKT activity. siRNA mediated depletion of
TWIST1 abrogated ARTN stimulated cellular behaviour associated with metastasis,
and forced expression of TWIST1 abrogated the functional effects of ARTN
depletion.
CONCLUSIONS: ARTN and TWIST1 synergize to produce a worse outcome in ER-MC and
combined inhibition of ARTN and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B
(PI3K/AKT) may therefore provide a novel therapeutic strategy in this subtype of 
mammary carcinoma.

The role of estrogen receptor-a (ER) in breast cancer development, and as a
primary clinical marker for breast cancer prognosis, has been well documented. In
this study, we identified the oncogenic protein, TWIST1 (Twist), which is
overexpressed in high-grade breast cancers, as a potential negative regulator of 
ER expression. Functional characterization of ER regulation by Twist was
performed using Twist low (MCF-7, T-47D) and Twist high (Hs 578T, MDA-MB-231,
MCF-7/Twist) expressing cell lines. All Twist high expressing cell lines
exhibited low ER transcript and protein levels. By chromatin immunoprecipitation 
and promoter assays, we demonstrated that Twist could directly bind to E-boxes in
the ER promoter and significantly downregulate ER promoter activity in vitro.
Functionally, Twist overexpression caused estrogen-independent proliferation of
breast cells, and promoted hormone resistance to the selective estrogen receptor 
modulator tamoxifen and selective estrogen receptor down-regulator fulvestrant.
Importantly, this effect was reversible on downregulating Twist. In addition,
orthotopic tumors generated in mice using MCF-7/Twist cells were resistant to
tamoxifen. These tumors had high vascular volume and permeability surface area,
as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Mechanistically, Twist
recruited DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) to the ER promoter, leading to a
significantly higher degree of ER promoter methylation compared with parental
cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation that Twist
interacted with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) at the ER promoter, causing histone
deacetylation and chromatin condensation, further reducing ER transcript levels. 
Functional re-expression of ER was achieved using the demethylating agent,
5-azacytidine, and the HDAC inhibitor, valproic acid. Finally, an inverse
relationship was observed between Twist and ER expression in human breast tumors.
In summary, the regulation of ER by Twist could be an underlying mechanism for
the loss of ER activity observed in breast tumors, and may contribute to the
generation of hormone-resistant, ER-negative breast cancer.

We recently demonstrated that overexpression of the nucleolar GTP-binding protein
nucleostemin drives the fraction of genetically-defined tumor cells that exhibit 
markers and tumorigenic properties of tumor initiating cells. More specifically, 
cells that constitutively express elevated levels of nucleostemin exhibit
increased TWIST expression; expression of genes that induced pluripotent stem
cells; enhanced radioresistance; tumor formation, even when small numbers of
cells are implanted; and an increased propensity to metastasize. An
immunohistochemical analysis of cancer stem cell markers, such as nucleostemin
and TWIST has not been conducted in surgically-resected esophageal squamous cell 
carcinomas after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In the present study, we examined the 
expression of CD133, CD44, nucleostemin, guanine nucleotide-binding protein-like 
3-like, and TWIST by immunohistochemistry in a series of 54 surgically-resected
specimens of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
We identified that high nucleostemin proportion, TWIST intensity, and advanced
pathological N stage were significantly correlated with poor relapse-free
survival. Together, these observations imply nucleostemin and TWIST as the
predictive markers for postoperative recurrence.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are naturally occurring single-stranded RNA molecules that
post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of target mRNA transcripts. Many
of these target mRNA transcripts are involved in regulating processes commonly
altered during tumorigenesis and metastatic growth. These include cell
proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Among the
several miRNAs, miRNA-10b (miR-10b) expression is increased in metastatic breast 
cancer cells and positively regulates cell migration and invasion through the
suppression of the homeobox D10 (HOXD10) tumor suppressor signaling pathway. In
breast metastatic cells, miR-10b expression is enhanced by a transcription factor
TWIST1. We find that miR-10b expression in breast cancer cells can be suppressed 
by CCN5, and this CCN5 effect is mediated through the inhibition of TWIST1
expression. Moreover, CCN5-induced inhibition of TWIST1 expression is mediated
through the translational inhibition/modification of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a 
via impeding JNK signaling pathway. Collectively, these studies suggest a novel
regulatory pathway exists through which CCN5 exerts its anti-invasive function.
On the basis of these findings, it is plausible that reactivation of CCN5 in
miR-10b-positive invasive/metastatic breast cancers alone or in combination with 
current therapeutic regimens could provide a unique, alternative strategy to
existing breast cancer therapy.

BACKGROUND: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition has recently attracted great
attention in studying the malignant progression of cells through a converging
pathway of oncogenesis and metastasis. Twist1 and Mastermind-like 1 (MAML1) are
major regulators of EMT through different pathways. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the clinicopathological relevance of the expression of MAML-1 and
Twist1 genes in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
METHODS: Tumoral and corresponding normal tissues from 55 treatment-naive ESCC
patients were subjected for expression analysis with quantitative real-time
RT-PCR.
RESULTS: Overexpression of MAML-1 and Twist1 were significantly associated with
lymph node metastasis and the surgical staging of tumor. Overexpression of Twist1
was associated with tumor depth of invasion. Mean relative expression (MRE) of
MAML1 was significantly higher in patients with metastasis to lymph nodes (3.07 ±
0.51 vs. 0.86 ± 0.58, P = .008). MRE of Twist1 was significantly higher in
patients with invasion of tumor to adventitia (T3, T4) (1.97 ± 0.29 vs. 0.39 ±
0.73, P = .036). In advanced stages of tumor (stage III, IV), a significantly
higher MRE of Twist1 (2.47 ± 0.41 vs. 1.25 ± 0.36, P = .035) and MAML1 (3.05 ±
0.45 vs. 1.07 ± 0.59, P = .021) mRNA was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: We introduce Twist1 and MAML1 as new molecular markers of advanced
tumor, which determine the characteristics and aggressive behavior of ESCC. Along
with the emerging evidence of their role in different cellular processes and
aberrations in various cancers, they are suggested as potentially interesting
therapeutic targets to reverse a broad spectrum of functional aberrations that
promote ESCC development.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a normal developmental program that is
considered to also play an important role in cancer metastasis. Ultimate inducers
of EMT are transcriptional repressors that individually can induce experimental
EMT, yet in many cells, particularly cancer cells, multiple inducers are
expressed simultaneously. Why, and if, and how they interact to regulate EMT is
unanswered. Using RNA interference technology to affect protein knockdown and
avoid potential overexpression artifact coupled with transient TGFß treatment to 
better mimic in vivo conditions we show, in both nontumorigenic and tumorigenic
epithelial cancer cells, that Snail1 is uniquely required for EMT initiation,
whereas Twist1 is required to maintain late EMT. Twist1, present in resting
epithelial cells, is dispensable for EMT initiation. Mechanistically, in response
to transient TGFß treatment, transient Snail1 expression represses Twist1
transcription directly, which is subsequently upregulated, as Snail1 levels
decrease, to sustain E-cadherin downregulation and growth arrest of EMT.
Persistent Twist1 expression is associated with a p38 and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase signal feedback loop that sustains growth-inhibitory
signals characteristic of quiescent micrometastatic tumors. This Snail1-Twist1
temporal and spatial cooperation was also observed in vivo during human breast
cancer progression to metastasis. Twist1 level, but not Snail1 level, and
Twist1:Snail1 ratio in disseminated micrometastatic bone marrow tumor cells was
found to correlate with survival and treatment resistance and is highly
predictive of metastatic or recurrent disease.

Twist in gastric cancer cells.

AIMS: To study the role of the Twist gene in growth of gastric cancer cell line
MKN45 and the possible mechanisms involved.
METHODS: Human gastric carcinoma MKN45 cells were stably transfected with Twist
antisense plasmid using the lipofectamine transfection technique. Expression of
Twist in Twist antisense plasmid transfected cells (TwistAS), non-transfected
cells (NT) and non-specific Twist antisense plasmid transfected cells (CON) were 
examined by Western blotting. Cell growth ability in vitro was evaluated by MTT
and clone formation assays. Xenograft cancer models were established by nude
mouse transfer method. Activator protein-1 (AP-1) DNA binding activity was
measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The expression of c-Jun 
and c-Fos were examined by Western blotting. The mRNA level of cyclin D1 was
detected by RT-PCR.
RESULTS: TwistAS inhibited cell growth and proliferation. In vitro, the cloning
efficiency of TwistAS cells (8.0 <U+200A>± <U+200A>0.6%) was significantly lower compared to
that in NT (26.5 <U+200A>± <U+200A>1.1%) and CON (22.7 <U+200A>± <U+200A>1.2%). In vivo, the average tumour
weight was lighter in the TwistAS group (425.3<U+200A> ± <U+200A>20.8<U+200A> mg) compared with the
CON group (1217.0 <U+200A>±<U+200A> 50.2 <U+200A>mg) and the NT group (1120.6<U+200A> ±<U+200A> 75<U+200A> mg). TwistAS
inhibited AP-1 activity in MKN45 cells (15.3<U+200A> ± <U+200A>3.2% versus 50.2<U+200A> ±<U+200A> 3.6% and
52.4 <U+200A>± <U+200A>3.8%). TwistAS inhibited the expression of c-Fos in MKN45 cells (20.4 <U+200A>±
<U+200A>3.8% versus 72.5<U+200A> ± <U+200A>3.6% and 75.3<U+200A> ±<U+200A> 4.0%) but not c-Jun (p<U+200A><<U+200A>0.05). cyclin D1
mRNA level was significantly lower in TwistAS cells (40.5<U+200A> ± <U+200A>3.8%) than that in 
CON (132<U+200A> ±<U+200A> 5.4%) and NT cells (130 <U+200A>± <U+200A>5.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that down-regulation of the Twist gene
suppressed the proliferation of MKN45 gastric cancer cells by negatively
regulating the AP-1 activity resulting in the cyclin D1 mRNA level decreasing.

Genes, active during normal development, are frequently reactivated during
neoplastic transformation and may be related to progression. One of them, the
transcription factor TP63, is crucial for pulmonary epithelial development and a 
possible target of the recurrent 3q amplifications in lung squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC). Here, we explored whether TP63 reactivation could be associated 
to cancer progression in lung SCC through an epithelial to mesenchymal
transition. We studied TP63 amplification and TP63 expression at RNA and protein 
levels and we analyzed the <U+0394>NTP63/TATP63 ratio that quantifies the proportion of 
the isoform lacking the transactivation domain/the isoform containing the
transactivation domain. We correlated TP63 status to survival and to the
expression of epithelial (E-cadherin and plakoglobin) and mesenchymal
(N-cadherin, vimentin, TWIST1, and SNAIL) markers. We found that high <U+0394>N/TA TP63 
ratio was related to high E-cadherin and plakoglobin mRNA levels (P < 0.05) and
that E-cadherin mRNA level was the only marker related to survival. Kaplan-Meier 
survival curves stratified according to the expression level of E-cadherin
showed, as already reported in breast cancer, that patients with low (first
quartile) or high (last quartile) E-cadherin expression had a worse survival with
respect to patients with intermediate E-cadherin expression. Altogether, our
results indicate that a reactivation of <U+0394>NTP63 is linked to the maintenance of
epithelial markers and suggest that E-cadherin has a dual role in lung SCC.

BACKGROUND: The adult central nervous system (CNS) contains different populations
of immature cells that could possibly be used to repair brain and spinal cord
lesions. The diversity and the properties of these cells in the human adult CNS
remain to be fully explored. We previously isolated Nestin+ Sox2+ neural
multipotential cells from the adult human spinal cord using the neurosphere
method (i.e. non adherent conditions and defined medium).
RESULTS: Here we report the isolation and long term propagation of another
population of Nestin+ cells from this tissue using adherent culture conditions
and serum. QPCR and immunofluorescence indicated that these cells had mesenchymal
features as evidenced by the expression of Snai2 and Twist1 and lack of
expression of neural markers such as Sox2, Olig2 or GFAP. Indeed, these cells
expressed markers typical of smooth muscle vascular cells such as Calponin,
Caldesmone and Acta2 (Smooth muscle actin). These cells could not differentiate
into chondrocytes, adipocytes, neuronal and glial cells, however they readily
mineralized when placed in osteogenic conditions. Further characterization
allowed us to identify the Nkx6.1 transcription factor as a marker for these
cells. Nkx6.1 was expressed in vivo by CNS vascular muscular cells located in the
parenchyma and the meninges.
CONCLUSION: Smooth muscle cells expressing Nestin and Nkx6.1 is the main cell
population derived from culturing human spinal cord cells in adherent conditions 
with serum. Mineralization of these cells in vitro could represent a valuable
model for studying calcifications of CNS vessels which are observed in
pathological situations or as part of the normal aging. In addition, long term
propagation of these cells will allow the study of their interaction with other
CNS cells and their implication in scar formation during spinal cord injury.

SET8 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and confers TWIST dual
transcriptional activities.

SET8 is implicated in transcriptional regulation, heterochromatin formation,
genomic stability, cell-cycle progression, and development. As such, it is
predicted that SET8 might be involved in the development and progression of
tumour. However, whether and how SET8 might be implicated in tumourigenesis is
currently unknown. Here, we report that SET8 is physically associated with TWIST,
a master regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We demonstrated
that SET8 and TWIST are functionally interdependent in promoting EMT and
enhancing the invasive potential of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We 
showed that SET8 acts as a dual epigenetic modifier on the promoters of the TWIST
target genes E-cadherin and N-cadherin via its H4K20 monomethylation activity.
Significantly, in breast carcinoma samples, SET8 expression is positively
correlated with metastasis and the expression of TWIST and N-cadherin and
negatively correlated with E-cadherin. Together, our experiments revealed a novel
role for SET8 in tumour invasion and metastasis and provide a molecular mechanism
underlying TWIST-promoted EMT, suggesting SET8 as a potential target for
intervention of the metastasis of breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have been associated with prognosis
especially in breast cancer and have been proposed as a liquid biopsy for
repeated follow up examinations. Molecular characterization of CTCs is difficult 
to address since they are very rare and the amount of available sample is very
limited.
METHODS: We quantified by RT-qPCR CK-19, MAGE-A3, HER-2, TWIST1, hTERT a+ß+, and 
mammaglobin gene transcripts in immunomagnetically positively selected CTCs from 
92 breast cancer patients, and 28 healthy individuals. We also compared our
results with the CellSearch system in 33 of these patients with early breast
cancer.
RESULTS: RT-qPCR is highly sensitive and specific and can detect the expression
of each individual gene at the one cell level. None of the genes tested was
detected in the group of healthy donors. In 66 operable breast cancer patients,
CK-19 was detected in 42.4%, HER-2 in 13.6%, MAGE-A3 in 21.2%, hMAM in 13.6%,
TWIST-1 in 42.4%, and hTERT a+ß+ in 10.2%. In 26 patients with verified
metastasis, CK-19 was detected in 53.8%, HER-2 in 19.2%, MAGE-A3 in 15.4%, hMAM
in 30.8%, TWIST-1 in 38.5% and hTERT a+ß+in 19.2%. Our preliminary data on the
comparison between RT-qPCR and CellSearch in 33 early breast cancer patients
showed that RT-qPCR gives more positive results in respect to CellSearch.
CONCLUSIONS: Molecular characterization of CTCs has revealed a remarkable
heterogeneity of gene expression between breast cancer patients. In a small
percentage of patients, CTCs were positive for all six genes tested, while in
some patients only one of these genes was expressed. The clinical significance of
these findings in early breast cancer remains to be elucidated when the clinical 
outcome for these patients is known.

Epidemiological studies and animal models suggest an association between high
levels of dietary fat intake and an increased risk of developing breast cancer.
Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) is a process, by which epithelial cells
are transdifferentiated to a mesenchymal state, and it has been implicated in
cancer progression, including invasion and metastasis. Linoleic acid (LA) induces
proliferation and invasion in breast cancer cells. However, the role of LA on the
EMT process in human mammary epithelial cells remains to be studied. In the
present study, we demonstrate that LA induces a transient down-regulation of
E-cadherin expression, accompanied with an increase of Snail1, Snail2, Twist1,
Twist2 and Sip1 expressions. Furthermore, LA induces FAK and NF<U+03BA>B activation,
MMP-2 and -9 secretions, migration and invasion. In summary, our findings
demonstrate, for the first time, that LA promotes an EMT-like process in MCF10A
human mammary epithelial cells.

Epithelial to mesenchymal transition is thought to be implicated in tumor
invasion and metastasis. To investigate its role in myometrial invasion, samples 
from 42 stage I (confined to the corpus) endometrioid endometrial carcinomas were
analyzed. All E-cadherin repressors (SNAI1, SNAI2 (SLUG), ZEB1, HMGA2, and
TWIST1) had a higher expression in endometrioid endometrial carcinomas than in
normal endometrium (P < .0001), whereas CDH1 (E-cadherin gene) tended to be
lower. In comparison with nonmyoinvasive (stage IA) tumors, those with deep
myometrial invasion (stage IC) had increased messenger RNA expression of SLUG,
ZEB1, and HMGA2 (P < .001). Furthermore, samples from the myoinvasive front of
deeply invasive tumors had higher levels of SLUG, ZEB1, and HMGA2 than the
corresponding superficial samples. Immunohistochemical analysis of these cases
revealed that the decrease in E-cadherin was concordant with an increase in Snail
and Twist protein expression. Trying to induce epithelial to mesenchymal
transition in endometrioid endometrial carcinomas, we initially produced
persistent activation of this pathway in Ishikawa cells. The cell line was
infected with lentiviruses carrying the V600E mutation of BRAF, inducing loss of 
ß-catenin, E-cadherin, and cytokeratin and increase in vimentin and Snail. These 
changes were mediated by ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which was also increased at the 
myoinvasive front. Furthermore, MEK1/2 inhibitor UO126 reversed the mesenchymal
phenotype. Our findings suggest that epithelial to mesenchymal transition
regulators are implicated in myometrial invasion of endometrioid endometrial
carcinoma and may be potential therapeutic targets through the MAPK/ERK pathway.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stemness: the Twist1-Bmi1
connection.

Wu KJ(1), Yang MH.

University, Taipei 112, Taiwan. kjwu2@ym.edu.tw

EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition), a major mechanism of cancer metastasis, 
is a process that generates cells with stem-like properties. These stem-like
cells in tumours are described as cancer stem cells. The link between EMT and
cancer stemness is well documented without detailed mechanistic proof. Bmi1
belongs to the PRC1 (polycomb repressive complex 1) maintaining self-renewal and 
stemness together with EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homologue 2), which is a component
of PRC2. Bmi1 is frequently overexpressed in different types of human cancers.
Recent demonstration of an EMT regulator, Twist1, directly regulating the
expression of Bmi1 provides a mechanistic explanation of the relationship between
EMT and cancer stemness. The functional interdependence between Twist1 and Bmi1
provides a fresh insight into the common mechanism mediating EMT and cancer
stemness. This observation is also confirmed using head and neck cancer patient
samples. These results provide a critical mechanism of Twist1-induced EMT and
cancer stemness in cancer cells through chromatin remodelling. The role of
hypoxia and microRNAs in regulating EMT and cancer stemness is also discussed.

Critical role for TWIST1 in the induction of human uterine decidualization.

Endocrinology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, 3333 Burnet Avenue,

The importance of the transcription factor TWIST1 for uterine decidualization was
examined in human uterine fibroblast (HUF) cells decidualized in vitro with
medroxyprogesterone, estradiol (E2), and prostaglandin E2. TWIST1 mRNA levels
increased by 6.0- to 6.8-fold during the first 1-2 d of decidualization and
remained above predecidualization levels for up to 15 d. Pretreatment of HUF
cells with a TWIST1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) for 3 d before the induction of
decidualization resulted in less morphologic differentiation than HUF cells
pretreated with a nonsilencing control RNA. In addition, the cells pretreated
with TWIST1 siRNA expressed 75-95% less IGF binding protein 1, LEFTY2,
fibromodulin, laminin, and several other mRNA during decidualization, including
the mRNA for the transcription factors forkhead box protein O1 and
v-ets-erythroblastosis virus E26, both of which were previously shown to be
critical for the induction of decidualization. The HUF cells pretreated with the 
TWIST1 siRNA also underwent less apoptosis during decidualization than the
control cells, as evidenced by a 20% decrease in DNA fragmentation (terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase 2'-deoxyuridine, 5'-triphosphate nick end labeling
assay) and a 43-48% decrease in caspase 3, BCL2-associated X protein, and TNF
receptor superfamily member 6 mRNA levels. Although the knockdown of TWIST1
expression markedly attenuated the induction of decidualization, overexpression
of TWIST1 alone was insufficient to induce the decidualization of HUF cells.
Taken together, these findings strongly implicate an essential role for TWIST1 in
the initiation of human decidualization and uterine stromal cell apoptosis that
occurs upstream of the induction of forkhead box protein O1 and
v-ets-erythroblastosis virus E26 mRNA.

Linkage between Twist1 and Bmi1: molecular mechanism of cancer
metastasis/stemness and clinical implications.

City, Taipei, Taiwan.

Cancer metastasis is the major cause of cancer-related death despite significant 
improvements in multimodal cancer therapy. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), a major mechanism of cancer metastasis, is a process that generates cells 
with stem cell-like properties (cancer stemness). Cancer stemness is a concept
that describes a minor population of cells (cancer stem cells) residing within a 
tumour that are able to self-renew and are resistant to conventional therapy. The
mechanisms delineating the generation of cancer stemness and its connection to
cancer metastasis remain largely unknown. Twist1 is an EMT regulator and
increased Twist1 expression, which has prognostic significance in various human
cancers, has been widely reported. Bmi1 is a critical component of polycomb
repressive complex (PRC) 1, which maintains self-renewal and stemness. Bmi1 is
frequently overexpressed in different types of human cancers and can induce drug 
resistance (Table 2). Recent studies have shown that Twist1 directly activates
Bmi1 expression and that these two molecules function together to mediate cancer 
stemness and EMT. These results present a unique mechanism of EMT-induced cancer 
metastasis and stemness. Further investigation of the mechanisms of EMT-mediated 
cancer metastasis and stemness will contribute to the management and treatment of
metastatic cancers.

Normal and disease-related biological functions of Twist1 and underlying
molecular mechanisms.

This article reviews the molecular structure, expression pattern, physiological
function, pathological roles and molecular mechanisms of Twist1 in development,
genetic disease and cancer. Twist1 is a basic helix-loop-helix domain-containing 
transcription factor. It forms homo- or hetero-dimers in order to bind the Nde1
E-box element and activate or repress its target genes. During development,
Twist1 is essential for mesoderm specification and differentiation. Heterozygous 
loss-of-function mutations of the human Twist1 gene cause several diseases
including the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. The Twist1-null mouse embryos die with
unclosed cranial neural tubes and defective head mesenchyme, somites and limb
buds. Twist1 is expressed in breast, liver, prostate, gastric and other types of 
cancers, and its expression is usually associated with invasive and metastatic
cancer phenotypes. In cancer cells, Twist1 is upregulated by multiple factors
including SRC-1, STAT3, MSX2, HIF-1a, integrin-linked kinase and NF-<U+03BA>B. Twist1
significantly enhances epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer cell
migration and invasion, hence promoting cancer metastasis. Twist1 promotes EMT in
part by directly repressing E-cadherin expression by recruiting the nucleosome
remodeling and deacetylase complex for gene repression and by upregulating Bmi1, 
AKT2, YB-1, etc. Emerging evidence also suggests that Twist1 plays a role in
expansion and chemotherapeutic resistance of cancer stem cells. Further
understanding of the mechanisms by which Twist1 promotes metastasis and
identification of Twist1 functional modulators may hold promise for developing
new strategies to inhibit EMT and cancer metastasis.

The basic helix loop helix transcription factor Twist1 is a novel regulator of
ATF4 in osteoblasts.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is an essential regulator of endochondral bone
formation and an important anabolic agent for the reversal of bone loss. PTH
mediates its functions in part by regulating binding of the bone-related
activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) to the osteoblast-specific gene,
osteocalcin. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors Twist1 and Twist2 also
regulate osteocalcin transcription in part through the interaction of the
C-terminal "box" domain in these factors and Runx2. In this study, we discovered 
a novel function of PTH: its ability to dramatically decrease Twist1
transcription. Since ATF4 is a major regulator of the PTH response in
osteoblasts, we assessed the mutual regulation between these factors and
determined that Twist proteins and ATF4 physically interact in a manner that
affects ATF4 DNA binding function. We mapped the interaction domain of Twist
proteins to the C-terminal "box" domain and of ATF4, to the N-terminus.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that Twist1 overexpression in osteoblasts attenuates 
ATF4 binding to the osteocalcin promoter in response to PTH. This study thus
identifies Twist proteins as novel inhibitory binding partners of ATF4 and
explores the functional significance of this interaction.

Stromal fibroblasts perform important roles in cancer development and
progression. Overexpression of Twist1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription
factor, is often associated with aggressive behavior in many tumors. In this
study, we investigated Twist1 expression patterns in gastric stromal fibroblasts 
and cancer cells using a monoclonal Twist1 antibody after validating the
effectiveness of four commercial Twist1-specific antibodies. Twist1 expression
was more frequently observed in gastric cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) than
in other cancer cells but was otherwise rarely expressed in noncancerous tissue. 
In laser capture microdissection of stromal fibroblasts, Twist1 immunopositive
fibroblasts exhibited significantly increased Twist1, fibroblast-specific protein
1, and CXCL14 mRNA expression. Furthermore, Twist1 mRNA expression showed a
significant linear correlation with that of platelet-derived growth factor
receptors ß and a. We found that conditioned media from Twist1-expressing skin
and lung fibroblasts significantly promote invasion of gastric cancer cells in
vitro. In 195 gastric cancer samples, CAF Twist1 expression was associated with
tumor size, invasion depth, and lymph node metastasis. Twist1 was also associated
with poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer, particularly in those with
the diffuse type. In conclusion, CAFs in gastric cancer frequently have altered
Twist1 expression, and increased Twist1 expression in fibroblasts contributes to 
the progression of cancer cells and poor patient survival.

BACKGROUND: Molecular classification of human breast cancers has identified at
least 5 distinct tumor subtypes; luminal A, luminal B, Her2-enriched, basal-like 
and claudin-low. The claudin-low subtype was identified in 2007 and is
characterized by low expression of luminal differentiation markers and claudins
3, 4 and 7 and high levels of mesenchymal markers. Claudin-low tumors have a
reported prevalence of 7-14% and these tumors have a poor prognosis.
RESULTS: In this study we report the characterization of several cell lines
established from mammary tumors that develop in MTB-IGFIR transgenic mice. Two
lines, RM11A and RJ348 present with histological features and gene expression
patterns that resemble claudin-low breast tumors. Specifically, RM11A and RJ348
cells express high levels of the mesenchymal genes Zeb1, Zeb2, Twist1 and Twist2 
and very low levels of E-cadherin and claudins 3, 4 and 7. The RM11A and RJ348
cells are also highly tumorigenic when re-introduced into the mammary fat pad of 
mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Mammary tumor cells established from MTB-IGFIR transgenic mice can
be used as in vitro and in vivo model systems to further our understanding of the
poorly characterized, claudin-low, breast cancer subtype.

Pituitary tumor-transforming gene (PTTG) is an oncogene with its expression
levels correlating with tumor development and metastasis. Epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial step in tumor progression and
metastasis. Using ovarian epithelial tumor cell line (A2780) for loss-of-function
or gain-of-function of PTTG in our experiments, we observed up regulation of
TGF-ß, Twist, Snail, Slug, vimentin and down regulation of E-cadherin on
infection of cells with Ad-PTTG cDNA. In contrast reverse phenomena was observed 
on depletion of PTTG on infection of cells with Ad-PTTG siRNA, suggesting an
important role of PTTG in induction of EMT in ovarian cancer cells.

The association between promoter methylation status and survival was investigated
in a large cohort of women with breast cancer, participants in the Long Island
Breast Cancer Study Project. Archived tumor tissues (n = 839) were collected from
women diagnosed with a first primary invasive or in situ breast cancer in
1996-1997. Vital status was followed through the end of 2005 with a mean
follow-up time of 8 years. Promoter methylation of eight breast cancer-related
genes was assessed by MethyLight. The frequencies of methylation for HIN1,
RASSF1A, DAPK1, GSTP1, CyclinD2, TWIST, CDH1 and RARß were 62.9, 85.2, 14.1,
27.8, 19.6, 15.3, 5.8 and 27.6%, respectively. Since survival rates of in situ
and invasive breast cancers are substantially different, survival analyses were
conducted within 670 invasive cases with complete data on all genes. Age-adjusted
Cox proportional hazards models revealed that GSTP1, TWIST and RARß methylation
was significantly associated with higher breast cancer-specific mortality.
Methylation of GSTP1 and RARß was significantly associated with higher all-cause 
mortality. To investigate the relationship between the number of methylated genes
and breast cancer-specific mortality, we included previously published MethyLight
data on p16 and APC methylation status. Breast cancer-specific mortality
increased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing number of methylated genes
(P (trend) = 0.002), although confidence intervals were wide. Our results suggest
that promoter methylation, particularly for a panel of genes, has the potential
to be used as a biomarker for predicting prognosis in breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial process in
tumorigenesis since tumor cells attain fibroblast-like features enabling them to 
invade to surrounding tissue. Two transcription factors, TWIST and SNAI1, are
fundamental in regulating EMT.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to study the expression of TWIST and SNAI1
in 109 pharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas.
RESULTS: Tumors with intense stromal staining of TWIST relapsed more frequently
(p = 0.04). Tumors with both positive TWIST and SNAI1 immunoreactivity in the
stroma were at least Stage II (p = 0.05) and located more often in hypopharynx (p
= 0.035). Tumors with negative immunostaining of TWIST and SNAI1 in the stromal
compartment were smaller (T1-2) (p = 0.008), less advanced (SI-II) (p = 0.031)
and located more often in the oropharynx (p = 0.007). Patients with negative
SNAI1 and TWIST immunostaining in tumor stroma had a better 5-year
disease-specific and overall survival (p = 0.037 and p = 0.014 respectively).
CONCLUSION: TWIST and SNAI1 expression in stromal cells is associated with
clinical and histopathological characteristics that indicate progressive disease.
Negative expression of these EMT-promoting transcription factors predicts a
better outcome.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), whether in developmental morphogenesis
or malignant transformation, prominently involves modified cell motility
behavior. Although major advances have transpired in understanding the molecular 
pathways regulating the process of EMT induction per se by certain environmental 
stimuli, an important outstanding question is how the activities of signaling
pathways governing motility yield the diverse movement behaviors characteristic
of pre-induction versus postinduction states across a broad landscape of growth
factor contexts. For the particular case of EMT induction in human mammary cells 
by ectopic expression of the transcription factor Twist, we found the migration
responses to a panel of growth factors (EGF, HRG, IGF, HGF) dramatically
disparate between confluent pre-Twist epithelial cells and sparsely distributed
post-Twist mesenchymal cells-but that a computational model quantitatively
integrating multiple key signaling node activities could nonetheless account for 
this full range of behavior. Moreover, motility in both conditions was
successfully predicted a priori for an additional growth factor (PDGF) treatment.
Although this signaling network state model could comprehend motility behavior
globally, modulation of the network interactions underlying the altered pathway
activities was identified by ascertaining differences in quantitative topological
influences among the nodes between the two conditions.

The developmental pathways involved in horn development are complex and still
poorly understood. Here we report the description of a new dominant inherited
syndrome in the bovine Charolais breed that we have named type 2 scurs. Clinical 
examination revealed that, despite a strong phenotypic variability, all affected 
individuals show both horn abnormalities similar to classical scurs phenotype and
skull interfrontal suture synostosis. Based on a genome-wide linkage analysis
using Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip genotyping data from 57 half-sib and full-sib
progeny, this locus was mapped to a 1.7 Mb interval on bovine chromosome 4.
Within this region, the TWIST1 gene encoding a transcription factor was
considered as a strong candidate gene since its haploinsufficiency is responsible
for the human Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, characterized by skull coronal suture
synostosis. Sequencing of the TWIST1 gene identified a c.148_157dup (p.A56RfsX87)
frame-shift mutation predicted to completely inactivate this gene. Genotyping 17 
scurred and 20 horned founders of our pedigree as well as 48 unrelated horned
controls revealed a perfect association between this mutation and the type 2
scurs phenotype. Subsequent genotyping of 32 individuals born from heterozygous
parents showed that homozygous mutated progeny are completely absent, which is
consistent with the embryonic lethality reported in Drosophila and mouse
suffering from TWIST1 complete insufficiency. Finally, data from previous studies
on model species and a fine description of type 2 scurs symptoms allowed us to
propose different mechanisms to explain the features of this syndrome. In
conclusion, this first report on the identification of a potential causal
mutation affecting horn development in cattle offers a unique opportunity to
better understand horn ontogenesis.

Craniosynostosis, the premature closure of cranial suture, is a pathologic
condition that affects 1/2000 live births. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a genetic 
condition characterized by craniosynostosis. The Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, which 
is defined by loss-of-function mutations in the TWIST gene, is the second most
prevalent craniosynostosis. Although much of the genetics and phenotypes in
craniosynostosis syndromes is understood, less is known about the underlying
ossification mechanism during suture closure. We have previously demonstrated
that physiological closure of the posterior frontal suture occurs through
endochondral ossification. Moreover, we revealed that antagonizing canonical
Wnt-signaling in the sagittal suture leads to endochondral ossification of the
suture mesenchyme and sagittal synostosis, presumably by inhibiting Twist1.
Classic Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is characterized by coronal synostosis, and the 
haploinsufficient Twist1(+/-) mice represents a suitable model for studying this 
syndrome. Thus, we seeked to understand the underlying ossification process in
coronal craniosynostosis in Twist1(+/-) mice. Our data indicate that coronal
suture closure in Twist1(+/-) mice occurs between postnatal day 9 and 13 by
endochondral ossification, as shown by histology, gene expression analysis, and
immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, this study reveals that coronal
craniosynostosis in Twist1(+/-) mice occurs through endochondral ossification.
Moreover, it suggests that haploinsufficiency of Twist1 gene, a target of
canonical Wnt-signaling, and inhibitor of chondrogenesis, mimics conditions of
inactive canonical Wnt-signaling leading to craniosynostosis.

Setleis Syndrome (OMIM ID: 227260) is a rare autosomal recessive disease
characterized by abnormal facial development. Recently, we have reported that two
nonsense mutations (c.486C>T [Q119X] and c.324C>T [Q65X]) of the basic
helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor TWIST2 cause Setleis Syndrome. Here 
we show that periostin, a cell adhesion protein involved in connective tissue
development and maintenance, is down-regulated in Setleis Syndrome patient
fibroblast cells and that periostin positively responds to manipulations in
TWIST2 levels, suggesting that TWIST2 is a transactivator of periostin.
Functional analysis of the TWIST2 mutant form (Q119X) revealed that it maintains 
the ability to localize to the nucleus, forms homo and heterodimers with the
ubiquitous bHLH protein E12, and binds to dsDNA. Reporter gene assays using
deletion constructs of the human periostin promoter also reveal that TWIST2 can
activate this gene more specifically than Twist1, while the Q119X mutant results 
in no significant transactivation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that
both wild-type TWIST2 and the Q119X mutant bind the periostin promoter, however
only wild-type TWIST2 is associated with higher levels of histone acetylation
across the 5'-regulatory region of periostin. Taken together, these data suggest 
that the C-terminal domain of TWIST2, which is missing in the Q119X mutant form
of TWIST2, is responsible for proper transactivation of the periostin gene.
Improper regulation of periostin by the mutant form of TWIST2 could help explain 
some of the soft tissue abnormalities seen in these patients therefore providing 
a genotype-phenotype relationship for Setleis Syndrome.

Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in the
development of metastases. One of the hallmarks of EMT is loss of E-cadherin and 
gain of N-cadherin expression, which are regulated by transcription factors, such
as SNAIL, SLUG, and TWIST. We examined the prognostic value of these factors as
well as E-cadherin and N-cadherin, in a well-described large cohort of breast
cancer patients treated with primary surgery. Analyses were stratified by
estrogen receptor (ER) status, because of its crucial role in the regulation of
these transcription factors. SNAIL, SLUG, and TWIST expression were examined on a
TMA containing 575 breast tumors using immunohistochemistry. Nuclear expression
was quantified using a weighted histoscore and classified as high versus low
expression, based on the median histoscore. High expression of SNAIL, SLUG, and
TWIST was seen in 54, 50, and 50% of tumors, respectively. The level of SNAIL (P 
= 0.014) and TWIST (P = 0.006) expression was associated with a worse patient
relapse-free period, specifically in patients with ER-positive tumors
(interaction Cox proportional hazards P = 0.039). Combining both factors resulted
in an independent prognostic factor with high discriminative power (both low
versus either high: HR 1.15; both low versus both high HR 1.84; P = 0.010).
Co-expression of SNAIL-TWIST was associated with low-E-cadherin and
high-N-cadherin expression, especially in ER-positive tumors (P = 0.009),
suggesting that, through interactions with ER, SNAIL and TWIST may regulate E-
and N-cadherin expression, thereby inducing EMT. Our results are indicative that 
SNAIL and TWIST play a crucial role in EMT through regulation of E- and
N-cadherin expression, exclusively in ER-positive breast cancer patients.

Evidence from various in vitro gain and loss of function studies indicate that
the bHLH transcription factor Twist1 negatively regulates chondrocyte
differentiation; however limited information regarding Twist1 function in
postnatal cartilage development and maintenance is available. Twist1 expression
within the postnatal growth plate is restricted to immature, proliferating
chondrocytes, and is significantly decreased or absent in hypertrophic
chondrocytes. In order to examine the effect of maintaining the expression of
Twist1 at later stages of chondocyte differentiation, we used type II collagen
Cre (Col2-Cre) mice to activate a Cre-inducible Twist1 transgene specifically in 
chondrocytes (Col2-Twist1). At two weeks, postnatal growth was inhibited in
Col2-Twist1 mice, as evidenced by limb shortening. Histological examination
revealed abnormal growth plate structure, characterized by poor columnar
organization of proliferating cartilaginous cells, decreased cellularity, and
expansion of the hypertrophic zone. Moreover, structural defects within the
growth plates of Col2-Twist1 transgenic mice included abnormal vascular invasion 
and focal regions of bony formation. Quantitative analysis of endochondral bone
formation via micro-computed topography revealed impaired trabecular bone
formation in the hindlimbs of Col2-Twist1 transgenic mice at various timepoints
of postnatal development. Taken together, these findings indicate that regulated 
Twist1 expression contributes to growth plate organization and endochondral
ossification to modulate postnatal longitudinal bone growth.

Compared with traditional cytotoxic cancer therapy, therapy-induced cancer cell
senescence attracts much interest because it is similarly effective, has fewer
side effects, and is more efficiently cleared by immune cells. In this study, we 
demonstrate that unlike caffeic acid phenethyl ester, caffeic acid
3,4-dihydroxy-phenethyl ester (CADPE), which is isolated from the medicinal
plants Sarcandra glabra and Teucrium pilosum, inhibits human cancer cell growth
and colony formation by inducing cancer cell senescence, not apoptosis. CADPE
induces cell senescence and morphology changes by increasing cellular size and
cytoplasmic granularity, enhancing senescence-associated ß-galactosidase activity
and differentiated embryo-chondrocyte expressed gene 1 expression, and blocking
cell-cycle arrest in the G(1) phase. To help understand the underlying
mechanisms, we show that CADPE significantly suppressed the expression of Twist1 
and led to the up-regulation of rat sarcoma, p53, p21(WAF1/CIP1), and p16(INK4a) 
proteins in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in the hypophosphorylation of
retinoblastoma protein. Furthermore, overexpression of Twist1 prevented
CADPE-induced cell senescence in tumor cells. Therefore, our studies provide
evidence for a novel role of CADPE in cancer cell senescence by targeting the
Twist1-dependent senescence signaling pathway.

transcription coactivation by Bcl-2 and Twist1: a study of hepatocellular
carcinoma.

The antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 plays multiple roles in apoptosis, immunity, and 
autophagy. Its expression in tumors correlates with tumor grade and malignancy.
The recapitulation of the normal developmental process of epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) contributes to tumor cell plasticity. This process is also a
characteristic of metastatic cells and vasculogenic mimicry. In the present study
we report functional and structural interactions between Bcl-2 and the
EMT-regulating transcription factor Twist1 and the relationship with metastasis
and vascular mimicry. Bcl-2 and Twist1 are coexpressed under hypoxia conditions. 
The Bcl-2 can bind to Twist1 in vivo and in vitro. This interaction involves
basic helix-loop-helix DNA binding domain within Twist1 and through two separate 
domains within Bcl-2 protein. Formation of the Bcl-2/Twist1 complex facilitates
the nuclear transport of Twist1 and leads to transcriptional activation of wide
ranges of genes that can increase the tumor cell plasticity, metastasis, and
vasculogenic mimicry. Finally, nuclear expression of Bcl-2 and Twist1 is
correlated with poor survival of these patients in a cohort of 97 cases of human 
hepatocellular carcinoma.CONCLUSION: The results describe a novel function of
Bcl-2 in EMT induction, provide insight into tumor progression, and implicate the
Bcl-2/Twist1 complex as a potential target for developing chemotherapeutics.

inducing EMT in human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro.

Aberrant Signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 (STAT3) signaling
pathway is a major cause of tumor invasion and metastasis; the underlying
mechanisms, however, are not well understood. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) is an early event that occurs during invasion of cancers of an epithelial
origin. It remains elusive whether STAT3signaling pathway is involved in EMT. The
objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of blockage of STAT3 signaling
pathway on IL-6 inducing EMT in human pancreatic cancer cells. We used SW1990
cells and induced them to undergo EMT by exposing these cells to soluble factor
interleukin-6 (IL-6). The expression of Snail, E-cadherin, and Twist was detected
by reverse transcription-PCR, real-time PCR, and Western blotting. Cell
morphology was observed under invert phase-contrast microscope.The invasion
ability was determined by cell invasion assay in vitro. Our results demonstrated 
that STAT3 signaling pathway was involved in pancreatic cancer cell invasion and 
EMT, and that EMT induced by IL-6 was associated with the activation of STAT3
signaling pathway. Inhibition of STAT3 signaling pathway by silencing of the
STAT3 gene with RNAi blocked STAT3 signaling pathway activation and suppressed
EMT in pancreatic cancer cells. Collectively, the STAT3 signaling pathway plays
an important role in the process of EMT of pancreatic cancer by regulating Snail 
gene expression. Better understanding of STAT3 signaling pathways in EMT may
contribute to development of novel therapeutic strategies in invasion and
metastasis of pancreatic cancer.

progression.

The interaction of cancer within a microenvironment is an important factor
determining cancer development. This study analyzed the soluble factors secreted 
by tumor-associated dendritic cells (TADCs), which are responsible for increasing
lung cancer growth, migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition. Addition of amphiregulin, present in large amounts in
TADC-conditioned medium (CM), mimicked the inductive effect of TADC-CM on lung
cancer progression, supported by the enhancement of cell proliferation,
migration, and invasion as well as osteolytic bone metastases phenotypes. In
contrast, neutralization of amphiregulin from TADC-CM decreased the advanced
malignancy-inductive properties of TADC-CM. Significant upregulation of
amphiregulin has been seen in tumor-infiltrating CD11c(+) DCs in human lung
cancer samples and patients' sera. The enhancement of amphiregulin in TADCs has
also been noted in mice transplanted with lung cancer cells. Induction of lung
cancer progression by TADC-derived amphiregulin is associated with increased
STAT3 and AKT activation, which subsequently increases the expression of cyclin
D, Twist, and Snail. Blocking AKT significantly decreases TADC-CM and
amphiregulin-mediated migration by decreasing the upregulation of Snail, whereas 
inhibition of STAT3 reduced the modulation of TADC-derived amphiregulin on Twist 
and cyclin D expression, suggesting that cooperation of STAT3 and AKT plays a
critical role in TADC-mediated cancer progression. Moreover, mice treated with
anti-amphiregulin Abs showed decreased incidence of cancer development and
increased survival rates. Our study suggests that inhibition of amphiregulin or
amphiregulin-related signaling is an attractive therapeutic target in lung cancer
patients.

Cancer stemness is a concept used to describe a minor population of cells (cancer
stem cells-CSCs) residing in a tumor, which possess self-renewal properties and
are resistant to chemo/radiation therapy. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), a major mechanism of cancer metastasis, is a process which generates cells
with stem-like properties. The relationship between cancer stemness and EMT is
well documented but without detailed mechanistic explanation. Bmi1 belongs to the
polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) which maintains self-renewal and stemness.
Recent results showed that Twist1, an EMT regulator, directly activates Bmi1 and 
these two molecules function together to mediate cancer stemness and EMT. These
results provide a molecular explanation of the relationship between cancer
stemness and EMT. Bmi1 is frequently overexpressed in various types of human
cancers and can confer drug resistance. Twist1 is also overexpressed in various
human cancers with prognostic significance. The functional interdependence
between Twist1 and Bmi1 provides a fresh insight into the molecular mechanism of 
EMT-induced cancer stemness. Further investigation of the mechanisms mediating
EMT and cancer stemness will be helpful in the management and treatment of
metastatic cancers.

Effect of dual-specificity protein phosphatase 5 on pluripotency maintenance and 
differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Cell Biology and Genetics, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang
University, 388 Yuhangtang Road, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.

The MAPK/Erk signaling pathway is considered as a key regulator of the
pluripotency and differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells, while
dual-specificity protein phosphatases (DUSPs) are negative regulators of MAPK.
Although DUSPs are potential embryogenesis regulators, their functions in the
regulation of ES cell differentiation have not been demonstrated. The present
study revealed that Dusp5 was expressed in mouse ES (mES) cells and that its
expression was correlated with the undifferentiated state of these cells.
Exogenous Dusp5 expression enhanced mES cell clonogenicity and suppressed mES
cell differentiation by maintaining Nanog expression via the inhibition of the
Erk pathway. Following Dusp5 knockdown, Nanog and Oct4 expression was
significantly attenuated and the Erk signaling pathway was activated.
Additionally, EBs derived from Dusp5 knockdown mES cells (KDEBs) exhibited a weak
adherence capability, very little outgrowth, and a reduction in the number of
epithelial-like cells. The expression of Gata6 (an endodermal marker) and Flk1
and Twist1 (mesodermal markers) was inhibited in KDEBs, which indicated that
Dusp5 influenced the differentiation of these germ layers during EB development. 
Collectively, this study suggested that Dusp5 plays an important role in the
maintenance of pluripotency in mES cells, and that Dusp5 may be required for EB
development.

and associated with its epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

BACKGROUND: Twist1 is known to be involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) and tumor progression. However, its specific role is different depending on
the type of cancer. The functional role and clinical significance of Twist1 in
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) have been rarely studied.
METHODS: We examined Twist1 expression in a total of 199 samples using
immunohistochemistry and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR). We also studied the association of Twist1 with EMT of ESCC
using tissue samples and in vitro models. In addition, we examined the changes in
the whole-genome expression profiles of two ESCC cell lines after inducing
upregulation of Twist1.
RESULTS: Twist1 expression was increased in ESCC compared with that of normal
esophagus (P < 0.01). We found that expression of Twist1 was strongly associated 
with poor prognosis on both univariate analysis [relative risk (RR) = 3.019,
P = 0.000] and multivariate analysis (RR = 3.131, P = 0.000). In addition, we
found that Twist1 expression was strongly correlated with EMT in ESCC tissues.
Upregulation of Twist1 induced other EMT inducers in all three esophageal cancer 
cell lines investigated (TE1, TE8, and TE10). Twist1 also enhanced the migratory 
and invasive abilities of all three cell lines. Finally, microarray analysis of
gene expression in the three ESCC cell lines revealed that Twist1 upregulation
affected the expression of mainly cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix-related
genes, which are directly related to cell morphology and movement.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that Twist1 is associated with EMT of esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma and may be used as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker 
in ESCC.

DNA methylation changes in atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, adenocarcinoma in
situ, and lung adenocarcinoma.

Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, United
States of America.

BACKGROUND: Aberrant DNA methylation is common in lung adenocarcinoma, but its
timing in the phases of tumor development is largely unknown. Delineating when
abnormal DNA methylation arises may provide insight into the natural history of
lung adenocarcinoma and the role that DNA methylation alterations play in tumor
formation.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used MethyLight, a sensitive real-time
PCR-based quantitative method, to analyze DNA methylation levels at 15 CpG
islands that are frequently methylated in lung adenocarcinoma and that we had
flagged as potential markers for non-invasive detection. We also used two repeat 
probes as indicators of global DNA hypomethylation. We examined DNA methylation
in 249 tissue samples from 93 subjects, spanning the putative spectrum of
peripheral lung adenocarcinoma development: histologically normal adjacent
non-tumor lung, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), adenocarcinoma in situ
(AIS, formerly known as bronchioloalveolar carcinoma), and invasive lung
adenocarcinoma. Comparison of DNA methylation levels between the lesion types
suggests that DNA hypermethylation of distinct loci occurs at different time
points during the development of lung adenocarcinoma. DNA methylation at CDKN2A
ex2 and PTPRN2 is already significantly elevated in AAH, while CpG islands at
2C35, EYA4, HOXA1, HOXA11, NEUROD1, NEUROD2 and TMEFF2 are significantly
hypermethylated in AIS. In contrast, hypermethylation at CDH13, CDX2, OPCML,
RASSF1, SFRP1 and TWIST1 and global DNA hypomethylation appear to be present
predominantly in invasive cancer.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The gradual increase in DNA methylation seen for
numerous loci in progressively more transformed lesions supports the model in
which AAH and AIS are sequential stages in the development of lung
adenocarcinoma. The demarcation of DNA methylation changes characteristic for
AAH, AIS and adenocarcinoma begins to lay out a possible roadmap for aberrant DNA
methylation events in tumor development. In addition, it identifies which DNA
methylation changes might be used as molecular markers for the detection of
preinvasive lesions.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent cancer worldwide. Let-7 family
has been shown to function as a tumor suppressor through regulating multiple
oncogenic signaling. Recent study reported that combined underexpression of
miR-205 and let-7d showed negative correlation with the survival prognosis of
head and neck cancer patients. However, the let-7d-involved mechanism in
regulating OSCC is still unclear. In this study, we first demonstrated that
let-7d expression was significantly decreased while Twist and Snail expression
was increased in OSCC cancer cell lines and primary cultures as compared to
normal human oral keratinocyte cells. To further investigate the role of let-7d
in OSCC, we applied the SPONGE method to knock down let-7d in OECM-1 and two
primary OSCC cell types. The results showed that knockdown of let-7d promote
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) traits and migratory/invasive
capabilities in OSCC cells. Furthermore, down-expression of let-7d significantly 
activated Twist and Snail expressions and chemo-resistant abilities of OSCC
cells. Notably, overexpression of let-7d effectively reversed the EMT phenotype, 
blocked migratory/invasive abilities, and further increased the chemosensitivity 
in oral cancer tumor initiating ALDH1+ cells. In sum, these results show that
let-7d negatively modulates EMT expression and also plays a role in regulating
chemo-resistant ability in oral cancer.

Targeting invadopodia to block breast cancer metastasis.

Eckert MA(1), Yang J.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmacology.

Better understanding the mechanisms underlying the metastatic process is
essential to developing novel targeted therapeutics. Recently, invadopodia have
been increasingly recognized as important drivers of local invasion in
metastasis. Invadopodia are basally-localized, actin-rich structures that
concentrate protease activity to areas of the cell in contact with the
extracellular matrix. We recently found that the transcription factor Twist1, a
central regulator of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), promotes
invadopodia formation via upregulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor
(PDGFR) expression and activity. This finding, combined with other investigations
into the mechanisms of invadopodia formation, reveal several novel targets for
clinical inhibition of invadopodia. Here, we provide an overview of
clinically-relevant targets for intervention in invadopodia, including Src
signaling, PDGFR signaling, and metalloprotease activity.

The neural crest is an induced tissue that is unique to vertebrates. In the
clawed frog Xenopus laevis, neural crest induction depends on signals secreted
from the prospective dorsolateral mesodermal zone during gastrulation. The
transcription factors Snail2 (Slug), Snail1 and Twist1 are expressed in this
region. It is known that Snail2 and Twist1 are required for both mesoderm
formation and neural crest induction. Using targeted blastomere injection,
morpholino-based loss of function and explant studies, we show that: (1) Snail1
is also required for mesoderm and neural crest formation; (2) loss of snail1,
snail2 or twist1 function in the C2/C3 lineage of 32-cell embryos blocks mesoderm
formation, but neural crest is lost only in the case of snail2 loss of function; 
(3) snail2 mutant loss of neural crest involves mesoderm-derived secreted factors
and can be rescued synergistically by bmp4 and wnt8 RNAs; and (4) loss of snail2 
activity leads to changes in the RNA levels of a number of BMP and Wnt agonists
and antagonists. Taken together, these results identify Snail2 as a key regulator
of the signals involved in mesodermal induction of neural crest.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS) is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndrome
with variable expression. Here we report on a female infant with a de novo
balanced translocation 46, XX, t(7;12)(p21.2;p12.3) and presenting at birth
brachycephaly, antimongolic palpebral fissures, ocular hypertelorism, broad nose 
with low nasal bridge and low-set ears. This phenotype is suggestive of a subtle 
form of SCS, given the absence of limbs anomalies. Cloning of both breakpoints
revealed that the translocation does not interrupt the TWIST1 coding region, on
7p21, known to be causative for SCS, but downregulates TWIST1 expression due to a
position effect. On chromosome 12, the breakpoint translocates a shorter
transcript of PTPRO gene, the osteoclastic protein-tyrosine phosphatase, PTP-oc, 
near to regulatory region of 7p leading to down-regulation of PTP-oc in the
proband's fibroblasts. This is a confirmatory case report providing further
evidence for TWIST1 haploinsufficiency in SCS, although a possible role of PTP-oc
as genetic factor underlying or at least influencing the development of
craniosynostosis could not be a priori excluded.

Cancer progression is commonly segregated into processes of primary tumour growth
and secondary metastasis. Recent evidence suggests that a subpopulation of cancer
cells, cancer stem cells (CSCs), is responsible for tumour growth in cancer.
However, the role of CSCs in cancer metastasis is unclear. In this study, we
found that the C terminus of CD44 contributes to sphere formation and survival in
vitro via the CD44-SRC-integrin axis. In addition, nuclear CD44/acetylated-STAT3 
is required for clonal formation in vitro and tumourigenicity in vivo. Nuclear
CD44 binds to various promoters identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation-seq, 
including that of c-myc and Twist1, leading to cell fate change through
transcriptional reprogramming. We propose that nuclear CD44/acetylated-STAT3
performs an unexpected tumour-progressing function by enhancing cell outgrowth
into structures where cells with properties of CSCs can be generated from
differentiated somatic cells in suspension culture, and then exhibit attributes
of cells that have undergone an epithelial-mesenchymal transition, leading to
tumour metastasis, and a resulting worse prognosis.

Aberrant DNA methylation plays a pivotal role in carcinogenesis and its mapping
is likely to provide biomarkers for improved diagnostic and risk assessment in
prostate cancer (PCa). We quantified and compared absolute methylation levels
among 28 candidate genes in 48 PCa and 29 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH)
samples using the pyrosequencing (PSQ) method to identify genes with diagnostic
and prognostic potential. RARB, HIN1, BCL2, GSTP1, CCND2, EGFR5, APC, RASSF1A,
MDR1, NKX2-5, CDH13, DPYS, PTGS2, EDNRB, MAL, PDLIM4, HLAa, ESR1 and TIG1 were
highly methylated in PCa compared to BPH (p < 0.001), while SERPINB5, CDH1,
TWIST1, DAPK1, THRB, MCAM, SLIT2, CDKN2a and SFN were not. RARB methylation above
21% completely distinguished PCa Separation based on methylation level of SFN,
SLIT2 and SERPINB5 distinguished low and high Gleason score cancers, e.g. SFN and
SERPINB5 together correctly classified 81% and 77% of high and low Gleason score 
cancers respectively. Several genes including CDH1 previously reported as
methylation markers in PCa were not confirmed in our study. Increasing age was
positively associated with gene methylation (p < 0.0001).Accurate quantitative
measurement of gene methylation in PCa appears promising and further validation
of genes like RARB, HIN1, BCL2, APC and GSTP1 is warranted for diagnostic
potential and SFN, SLIT2 and SERPINB5 for prognostic potential.

HIF-1a mediates tumor hypoxia to confer a perpetual mesenchymal phenotype for
malignant progression.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Neurosurgery, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, USA.

Although tumor progression involves genetic and epigenetic alterations to normal 
cellular biology, the underlying mechanisms of these changes remain obscure.
Numerous studies have shown that hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF-1a) is
overexpressed in many human cancers and up-regulates a host of hypoxia-responsive
genes for cancer growth and survival. We recently identified an alternative
mechanism of HIF-1a function that induces genetic alterations by suppressing DNA 
repair. Here, we show that long-term hypoxia, which mimics the tumor
microenvironment, drives a perpetual epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
through up-regulation of the zinc finger E-box binding homeobox protein ZEB2,
whereas short-term hypoxia induces a reversible EMT that requires the
transcription factor Twist1. Moreover, we show that the perpetual EMT driven by
chronic hypoxia depends on HIF-1a induction of genetic alterations rather than
its canonical transcriptional activator function. These mesenchymal tumor cells
not only acquire tumorigenicity but also display characteristics of advanced
cancers, including necrosis, aggressive invasion, and metastasis. Hence, these
results reveal a mechanism by which HIF-1a promotes a perpetual mesenchymal
phenotype, thereby advancing tumor progression.

TWIST1 promotes the odontoblast-like differentiation of dental stem cells.

Stem cells derived from the dental pulp of extracted human third molars (DPSCs)
have the potential to differentiate into odontoblasts, osteoblasts, adipocytes,
and neural cells when provided with the appropriate conditions. To advance the
use of DPSCs for dentin regeneration, it is important to replicate the permissive
signals that drive terminal events in odontoblast differentiation during tooth
development. Such a strategy is likely to restore a dentin matrix that more
resembles the tubular nature of primary dentin. Due to the limitations of culture
conditions, the use of ex vivo gene therapy to drive the terminal differentiation
of mineralizing cells holds considerable promise. In these studies, we asked
whether the forced expression of TWIST1 in DPSCs could alter the potential of
these cells to differentiate into odontoblast-like cells. Since the partnership
between Runx2 and Twist1 proteins is known to control the onset of osteoblast
terminal differentiation, we hypothesized that these genes act to control lineage
determination of DPSCs. For the first time, our results showed that Twist1
overexpression in DPSCs enhanced the expression of DSPP, a gene that marks
odontoblast terminal differentiation. Furthermore, co-transfection assays showed 
that Twist1 stimulates Dspp promoter activity by antagonizing Runx2 function in
293FT cells. Analysis of our in vitro data, taken together, suggests that lineage
specification of DPSCs can be modulated through ex vivo gene modifications.

INTRODUCTION: Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is considered an
essential process in the metastatic cascade. EMT is characterised by upregulation
of vimentin, Twist, Snail, Slug and Sip1 among others. Metastasis is also
associated with the presence of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) and disseminated 
tumour cells in the blood and bone marrow, respectively, of breast cancer
patients, but the expression of EMT markers in these cells has not been reported 
so far.
METHODS: The expression of Twist and vimentin in CTCs of 25 metastatic and 25
early breast cancer patients was investigated by using double-immunofluorescence 
experiments in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cell cytospins using
anti-cytokeratin (anti-CK) anti-mouse (A45-B/B3) and anti-Twist or anti-vimentin 
anti-rabbit antibodies.
RESULTS: Among early breast cancer patients, vimentin-and Twist-expressing CK(+) 
CTCs were identified in 77% and 73% of the patients, respectively, and in 100% of
the patients with metastatic breast cancer for both markers (P = 0.004 and P =
0.037, respectively). Among patients with early disease, 56% and 53% of the CK(+)
CTCs were double-stained with vimentin and Twist, and the corresponding values
for metastatic patients were 74% and 97%, respectively (P = 0.005 and P = 0.0001,
respectively). The median expression of CK(+)vimentin(+) and CK(+)Twist(+) cells 
per patient in metastatic patients was 98% and 100%, and in an adjuvant
chemotherapy setting the corresponding numbers were 56% and 40.6%, respectively. 
Triple-staining experiments revealed that all CK(+)Twist(+) or CK(+)vimentin(+)
cells were also CD45(-), confirming their epithelial origin. Immunomagnetic
separation of CTCs and triple-immunofluorescence with
anti-CK/anti-Twist/anti-vimentin antibodies demonstrated that both mesenchymal
markers could be coexpressed in the same CK(+) cell, since 64% of the total
identified CTCs were triple-stained. There was a significant correlation (P =
0.005) between the number of CTCs expressing Twist and vimentin within the same
setting.
CONCLUSIONS: CTCs expressing Twist and vimentin, suggestive of EMT, are
identified in patients with breast cancer. The high incidence of these cells in
patients with metastatic disease compared to early stage breast cancer strongly
supports the notion that EMT is involved in the metastatic potential of CTCs.

venom cystatin through reduction of proteinases activity and
epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

Snake venom cystatin (sv-cystatin) is a member of the cystatin family of cysteine
protease inhibitors. To further evaluate the possibility of sv-cystatin in cancer
therapy, this study examined the effects of sv-cystatin on the invasion and
metastasis of liver cancer cells (MHCC97H) in vitro and in vivo as well as the
underlying mechanism. sv-cystatin cDNA was transfected into MHCC97H cells and the
anti-invasion and antimetastasis effects of sv-cystatin were determined using
migration and matrigel invasion assays and a lung-metastasis mice model. The
results suggest that sv-cyst clone (sv-cystatin expression in MHCC97H cells)
delayed the invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo compared to the
parental, mock and si-sv-cyst clone cells (inhibited sv-cystatin expression by
siRNA). The decreased activities of cathepsin B, MMP-2 and MMP-9 and EMT change
index including higher E-cadherin, lower N-cadherin and decreased Twist activity 
were observed in the sv-cyst clone, which contributes to the change in invasion
and metastasis ability of MHCC97H cells. This study provides evidence that
expression of the sv-cystatin gene in MHCC97H cells inhibits tumor cell invasion 
and metastasis through the reduction of the proteinases activity and
Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), which might contribute to the anticancer
research of the sv-cystatin protein.

BACKGROUND: D-Glucuronyl C5-epimerase (GLCE) is a key enzyme involved in the
biosynthesis of heparan sulphate proteoglycans, which has an important role in
cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and signalling. Decreased GLCE expression 
in human breast tumours and its anti-proliferative effects in breast cancer cells
suggest that it may be a candidate tumour-suppressor gene. The aim of this study 
was to investigate the involvement of GLCE in lung carcinogenesis.
METHODS: D-Glucuronyl C5-epimerase expression in different lung cancer cell lines
was determined and the gene was ectopically re-expressed in U2020 small-cell lung
cancer cells. Cellular proliferation in vitro and tumour growth in vivo were then
examined.
RESULTS: Ectopic re-expression of GLCE in U2020 cells did not affect cell
viability but did influence morphology. Cellular proliferation in vitro and
tumour formation in vivo were both suppressed. These effects were mediated via
downregulation of several pro-angiogenic growth factors and their receptors,
including VEGF-A, TGFB1, FGFR2, PDGF-A and PDGF-B, and TNFa and its receptors.
Expression of matrix metalloproteinase2, MTA1, PLAU, TIMP3, S100A4, SERPINE1 and 
TWIST1 was also downregulated.
CONCLUSION: The anti-tumour effects associated with ectopic GLCE re-expression
suggest that it may be a potential tumour-suppressor gene and a possible target
for lung cancer diagnosis and treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relation of EB virus latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1)
and the phenotype of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cervical lymph
node metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
METHOD: Based on histopathology and MRI imaging, nasopharyngeal biopsy tissues
from 88 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were divided into 3 groups:
pathologic metastasis (18), MRI metastasis(40) and without metastasis (30). The
expressions of LMP-1, STAT3, Twist, E-Cadherin and Vimentin were examined
immunohistochemically in biopsy tissues.
RESULT: LMP-1 expression was found in 35 of 88 biopsy tissues with a positive
rate of 38.7%. The positive rates of LMP-1 in groups of pathologic metastasis,
MRI metastasis and without metastasis were 38.9% (7/18), 47.5% (19/40) and 30.0% 
(9/30), respectively, and significant difference were not found among three
groups. The expression of LMP-1 was positively correlated to both expressions of 
Twist and Vimentin (r = 0.276 and 0.282, are P < 0.01), but not to both
expressions of STAT3 and E-Cadherin. The positive expressions or abnormal
expression of STAT3, Twist, Vimentin and E-Cadherin were found in 57 of 88
(64.8%), 48 of 88 (54.5%), 22 of 88 (20.0%)and 53 of 88 (60.2%), respectively.
Significant differences in the expression of STAT3, Twist, Vimentin and
E-Cadherin were all found among groups of pathologic metastasis, MRI metastasis
and without metastasis, respectively (are P < 0.05). The expression of STAT3 was 
positively correlated to both expressions of Twist and Vimentin (r = 0.712 and
0.316, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: EMT plays important role in cervical lymph node metastasis in
nasopharyngeal carcinoma. LMP-1 may be only as one of upstream factors associated
with the EMT, but not the decisive factor for cervical lymph node metastasis.

Heparin impairs angiogenesis through inhibition of microRNA-10b.

Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai.

Heparin, which has been used as an anticoagulant drug for decades, inhibits
angiogenesis, whereas thrombin promotes tumor-associated angiogenesis. However,
the mechanisms underlying the regulation of angiogenesis by heparin and thrombin 
are not well understood. Here, we show that microRNA-10b (miR-10b) is
down-regulated by heparin and up-regulated by thrombin in human microvascular
endothelial cells (HMEC-1). Overexpression of miR-10b induces HMEC-1 cell
migration, tube formation, and angiogenesis, and down-regulates homeobox D10
(HoxD10) expression via direct binding of miR-10b to the putative 3' UTR of
HoxD10. In addition, HMEC-1 cell migration and tube formation are induced by
HoxD10 knockdown, whereas angiogenesis is arrested when HoxD10 expression is
increased after anti-miR-10b or heparin treatments. Furthermore, expression of
miR-10b and its transcription factor Twist are up-regulated by thrombin, whereas 
HoxD10 expression is impaired by thrombin. Using quartz crystal microbalance
analysis, we show that heparin binds to thrombin, thereby inhibiting
thrombin-induced expression of Twist and miR-10b. However, the expression of
miR-10b is not attenuated by heparin any more after thrombin expression is
silenced by its siRNA. Interestingly, we find that heparin attenuates miR-10b
expression and induces HoxD10 expression in vivo to inhibit angiogenesis and
impair the growth of MDA-MB-231 tumor xenografts. These results provide insight
into the molecular mechanism by which heparin and thrombin regulate angiogenesis.

Follicular dendritic cells (FDC) are an important subset of stromal cells within 
the germinal centres of lymphoid tissues. They are specialized to trap and retain
antigen-containing immune complexes on their surfaces to promote B-cell
maturation and immunoglobulin isotype class-switching. However, little is known
of the cell types from which FDC originate. To address fundamental questions
associated with the relationships between FDC and other cell populations, we took
advantage of the growing body of publicly available data for transcriptome
analysis. We obtained a large number of gene expression data files from a range
of different primary mouse cells and cell lines and subjected these data to
network-based cluster analysis using BiolayoutExpress(3D) . Genes with related
function clustered together in distinct regions of the graph and enabled the
identification of transcriptional networks that underpin the functional activity 
of distinct cell populations. Several gene clusters were identified that were
selectively expressed by cells of mesenchymal lineage and contained classic
mesenchymal cell markers and extracellular matrix genes including various
collagens, Acta2, Bgn, Fbn1 and Twist1. Our analysis showed that FDC also express
highly many of these mesenchyme-associated genes. Promoter analysis of the genes 
comprising the mesenchymal clusters identified several regulatory motifs that are
binding sites for candidate transcription factors previously known to be
candidate regulators of mesenchyme-specific genes. Together, these data suggest
FDC are a specialized mesenchymal cell population within the germinal centres of 
lymphoid tissues.

Traditional research modes aim to find cancer-specific single therapeutic target.
Recently, emerging evidence suggested that some micro-RNAs (miRNA) can function
as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. miRNAs are single-stranded, small noncoding
RNA genes that can regulate hundreds of downstream target genes. In this study,
we evaluated the miRNA expression patterns in gastric carcinoma and the specific 
role of miR-223 in gastric cancer metastasis. miRNA expression signature was
first analyzed by real-time PCR on 10 paired gastric carcinomas and confirmed in 
another 20 paired gastric carcinoma tissues. With the 2-fold expression
difference as a cutoff level, we identified 22 differential expressed mature
miRNAs. Sixteen miRNAs were upregulated in gastric carcinoma, including miR-223, 
miR-21, miR-23b, miR-222, miR-25, miR-23a, miR-221, miR-107, miR-103, miR-99a,
miR-100, miR-125b, miR-92, miR-146a, miR-214 and miR-191, and six miRNAs were
downregulated in gastric carcinoma, including let-7a, miR-126, miR-210, miR-181b,
miR-197, and miR-30aa-5p. After examining these miRNAs in several human gastric
originated cell lines, we found that miR-223 is overexpressed only in metastatic 
gastric cancer cells and stimulated nonmetastatic gastric cancer cells migration 
and invasion. Mechanistically, miR-223, induced by the transcription factor
Twist, posttranscriptionally downregulates EPB41L3 expression by directly
targeting its 3'-untranslated regions. Significantly, overexpression of miR-223
in primary gastric carcinomas is associated with poor metastasis-free survival.
These findings indicate a new regulatory mode, namely, specific miRNA, which is
activated by its upstream transcription factor, could suppress its direct targets
and lead to tumor invasion and metastasis.

Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cells (CSC) have been
associated with resistance to chemotherapy. Eighty percent of ovarian cancer
patients initially respond to platinum-based combination therapy but most return 
with recurrence and ultimate demise. To better understand such chemoresistance we
have assessed the potential role of EMT in tumor cells collected from
advanced-stage ovarian cancer patients and the ovarian cancer cell line OVCA 433 
in response to cisplatin in vitro. We demonstrate that cisplatin-induced
transition from epithelial to mesenchymal morphology in residual cancer cells
correlated with reduced E-cadherin, and increased N-cadherin and vimentin
expression. The mRNA expression of Snail, Slug, Twist, and MMP-2 were
significantly enhanced in response to cisplatin and correlated with increased
migration. This coincided with increased cell surface expression of CSC-like
markers such as CD44, a2 integrin subunit, CD117, CD133, EpCAM, and the
expression of stem cell factors Nanog and Oct-4. EMT and CSC-like changes in
response to cisplatin correlated with enhanced activation of extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. The selective MEK inhibitor U0126 inhibited
ERK2 activation and partially suppressed cisplatin-induced EMT and CSC markers.
In vivo xenotransplantation of cisplatin-treated OVCA 433 cells in zebrafish
embryos demonstrated significantly enhanced migration of cells compared to
control untreated cells. U0126 inhibited cisplatin-induced migration of cells in 
vivo, suggesting that ERK2 signaling is critical to cisplatin-induced EMT and CSC
phenotypes, and that targeting ERK2 in the presence of cisplatin may reduce the
burden of residual tumor, the ultimate cause of recurrence in ovarian cancer
patients.

epithelial-mesenchymal transition in lung cancer cells.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which involves the persistent loss of
epithelial markers and expression of mesenchymal markers, is assumed to have a
critical role in not only tissue development during embryogenesis but also
central mechanisms that enhance the invasive and metastatic ability of cancer
cells. Twist has been identified to play an essential role in EMT-mediated tumor 
invasion and metastasis. Although recent studies suggest that twist expression
levels in tissue specimens of lung cancer might be associated with prognosis, the
expression of twist in lung cancer cells itself and its effect have not been
fully evaluated. Here, we evaluated twist expression and its effect on phenotype 
alteration in lung cancer cell lines. Twist expression varied among human lung
cancer cell lines. The lung cancer cell lines with high twist expression also
tended to show a high vimentin/E-cadherin ratio, which was supported by a
migration assay, in which high twist expression gave rise to high cell motility. 
Furthermore, in comparison to control cells, the lung cancer cells with ectopic
expression of twist showed a significant phenotype alteration through EMT and an 
increasing ability to migrate in vitro, in part, due to a tenfold increase in
matrix metalloproteinases activity and almost a 60% increase in modulation of
focal adhesion kinase activity, although a contribution of microRNA appeared
unlikely in our study. Our present analysis of twist expression in lung cancer
provide clues to comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms, by which
metastasis often develops in lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: The Twist1-family basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors
including Twist1, Hand1 and Hand2, play an essential role in heart development
and are implicated in pathological heart remodeling. Previously, it was reported 
that these bHLH transcription factors can be regulated by phosphorylation within 
the basic-helix I domain, which is involved in developmental processes such as
limb formation and trophoblast differentiation. However, how phosphorylation of
Twist1 family functions in post-natal heart is elusive.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we generated transgenic mice with over-expression of
Hand1 and Twist1 mutants (to mimic or to abolish phosphorylation) in
cardiomyocytes and found pathological cardiac remodeling leading to heart failure
and sudden death. Gene expression profile analysis revealed up-regulation of
growth-promoting genes and down-regulation of metabolic genes. It is well known
that aberrant activation of Akt signaling causes pathological cardiac remodeling 
and results in heart failure. The basic-helix I domain of Twist1 family members
contain Akt substrate consensus motif and may be downstream targets of Akt
signaling. Using biochemical analysis, we demonstrated that Hand1 and Twist1 were
phosphorylated by Akt in the basic-helix I domain. Phosphorylation of Hand1
regulated its transcriptional activation of luciferase reporter genes and DNA
binding ability.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel insights into the regulation of Twist1
family in cardiac remodeling and suggests that the Twist1 family can be regulated
by Akt signaling.

IL-6 stabilizes Twist and enhances tumor cell motility in head and neck cancer
cells through activation of casein kinase 2.

Biomedical Sciences, Houston, Texas, United States of America.

BACKGROUND: Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is the seventh
most common cancer worldwide. Unfortunately, the survival of patients with SCCHN 
has not improved in the last 40 years, and thus new targets for therapy are
needed. Recently, elevations in serum level of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and
expression of Twist in tumor samples were found to be associated with poor
clinical outcomes in multiple types of cancer, including SCCHN. Although Twist
has been proposed as a master regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and 
metastasis in cancers, the mechanisms by which Twist levels are regulated
post-translationally are not completely understood. Tumor progression is
characterized by the involvement of cytokines and growth factors and Twist
induction has been connected with a number of these signaling pathways including 
IL-6. Since many of the effects of IL-6 are mediated through activation of
protein phosphorylation cascades, this implies that Twist expression must be
under a tight control at the post-translational level in order to respond in a
timely manner to external stimuli.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our data show that IL-6 increases Twist
expression via a transcription-independent mechanism in many SCCHN cell lines.
Further investigation revealed that IL-6 stabilizes Twist in SCCHN cell lines
through casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylation of Twist residues S18 and S20, and 
that this phosphorylation inhibits degradation of Twist. Twist phosphorylation
not only increases its stability but also enhances cell motility. Thus,
post-translational modulation of Twist contributes to its tumor-promoting
properties.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study shows Twist expression can be regulated at
the post-translational level through phosphorylation by CK2, which increases
Twist stability in response to IL-6 stimulation. Our findings not only provide
novel mechanistic insights into post-translational regulation of Twist but also
suggest that CK2 may be a viable therapeutic target in SCCHN.

Role of Twist in vasculogenic mimicry formation in hypoxic hepatocellular
carcinoma cells in vitro.

Medicine, Xian Jiaotong University, No. 277 Yanta West Road, Xian, PR China.

Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) refers to the unique ability of highly aggressive human
tumor cells to form matrix-rich networks de novo when cultured on a
three-dimensional matrix, thus mimicking embryonic vasculogenesis. Some studies
have shown that tumor hypoxia can promote tumor cells to form vessel-like tubes
in vitro and express genes associated with VM. Although, the mechanisms involved 
in hypoxia-induced VM remain elusive, we hypothesized that the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulator Twist may play a major role in 
hypoxia-induced VM. We investigated this hypothesis in vitro by pretreating
hepatocellular carcinoma cells under hypoxic conditions. Following the hypoxia
treatment, the cells formed typical pipe-like VM networks. Moreover, the
expression of VM markers was increased. Hypoxia-induced VM was accompanied by the
increased expression of Twist. Twist siRNA reversed the effects of hypoxia on VM.
These results suggest that the overexpression of Twist correlates to
hypoxia-induced VM in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.

The role of TWIST as a regulator in giant cell tumor of bone.

Singh S(1), Mak IW, Cowan RW, Turcotte R, Singh G, Ghert M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Surgery, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

Giant cell tumor of bone (GCT) is an aggressive tumor consisting of
multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells and proliferating osteoblast-like
stromal cells. Our group has reported that the stromal cells express high levels 
of the bone resorbing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13, and that this expression
is regulated by the osteoblast transcription factor Runx2. The purpose of this
study was to determine the upstream regulation of Runx2 in GCT cells. Using GCT
stromal cells obtained from patient specimens, we demonstrated that TWIST, a
master osteogenic regulator, was highly expressed in all GCT specimens. TWIST
overexpression downregulated Runx2 expression whereas TWIST siRNA knockdown
resulted in Runx2 and MMP-13 upregulation. Interestingly, cells obtained from a
GCT lung metastasis showed a reverse regulatory pattern between TWIST and Runx2. 
In mutational analysis, we revealed a point mutation (R154S) at the Helix2 domain
of TWIST. This TWIST mutation may be an essential underlying factor in the
development and pathophysiology of these tumors in that they lead to
inappropriate TWIST downregulation of Runx2, arrested osteoblastic
differentiation, and the maintenance of an immature and neoplastic phenotype.

Phosphorylation of serine 68 of Twist1 by MAPKs stabilizes Twist1 protein and
promotes breast cancer cell invasiveness.

Twist1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, promotes breast tumor cell
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasiveness, and metastasis. However,
the mechanisms responsible for regulating Twist1 stability are unknown in these
cells. We identified the serine 68 (Ser 68) as a major phosphorylation site of
Twist1 by mass spectrometry and with specific antibodies. This Ser 68 is
phosphorylated by p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and extracellular
signal-regulated kinases1/2 in vitro, and its phosphorylation levels positively
correlate with Twist1 protein levels in human embryonic kidney 293 and breast
cancer cells. Prevention of Ser 68 phosphorylation by an alanine (A) mutation
(Ser 68A) dramatically accelerates Twist1 ubiquitination and degradation.
Furthermore, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) by an active 
Ras protein or TGF-ß treatment significantly increases Ser 68 phosphorylation and
Twist1 protein levels without altering Twist1 mRNA expression, whereas blocking
of MAPK activities by either specific inhibitors or dominant negative inhibitory 
mutants effectively reduces the levels of both induced and uninduced Ser 68
phosphorylation and Twist protein. Accordingly, the mammary epithelial cells
expressing Twist1 exhibit much higher degrees of EMT and invasiveness on
stimulation with TGF-ß or the active Ras and paclitaxel resistance compared with 
the same cells expressing the Ser 68A-Twist1 mutant. Importantly, the levels of
Ser 68 phosphorylation in the invasive human breast ductal carcinomas positively 
correlate with the levels of Twist1 protein and JNK activity and are
significantly higher in progesterone receptor-negative and HER2-positive breast
cancers. These findings suggest that activation of MAPKs by tyrosine kinase
receptors and Ras signaling pathways may substantially promote breast tumor cell 
EMT and metastasis via phoshorylation and stabilization of Twist1.

The cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip¹ controls self-renewal and pluripotency of human 
embryonic stem cells by regulating the cell cycle, Brachyury and Twist.

The continued turn over of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) while maintaining an
undifferentiated state is dependent on the regulation of the cell cycle. Here we 
asked the question if a single cell cycle gene could regulate the self-renewal or
pluripotency properties of hESC. We identified that the protein expression of the
p27(Kip)¹ cell cycle inhibitor is low in hESC cells and increased with
differentiation. By adopting a gain and loss of function strategy we forced or
reduced its expression in undifferentiating conditions to define its functional
role in self-renewal and pluripotency. Using undifferentiation conditions,
overexpression of p27(Kip)¹ in hESC lead to a G1phase arrest with an enlarged and
flattened hESC morphology and consequent loss of self-renewal ability. Loss of
p27(Kip)¹ caused an elongated/scatter cell-like phenotype involving up-regulation
of Brachyury and Twist gene expression. We demonstrate the novel finding that
p27(Kip)¹ protein occupies the Twist1 gene promoter and manipulation of p27(Kip)¹
by gain and loss of function is associated with Twist gene expression changes.
These results define p27(Kip)¹ expression levels as critical for self-renewal and
pluripotency in hESC and suggest a role for p27(Kip)¹ in controlling an
epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hESC.

The purpose of this article is to investigate the prognostic value of the mitotic
activity index (MAI) and the presence of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in bone 
marrow (BM), in clinically operable breast cancer patients. We compared routinely
assessed MAI, classic prognosticators and BM DTCs, detected by a real-time RT-PCR
multimarker assay including cytokeratin 19, mammaglobin A and TWIST1 mRNA, in 179
consecutive patients with operable breast cancer. Over a median follow-up of 96
months (range: 1-126 months), 31 (17.3%) patients experienced a systemic relapse 
and 26 (14.5%) died of breast cancer-related causes. MAI (= 10) was strongly
associated with breast cancer-related death in lymph node (LN)-negative patients 
(hazard ratio (HR): 7.0, confidence interval (CI) 1.74-27.9), whereas both BM
DTC-status (HR: 3.3, CI 1.25-8.52) and MAI (HR: 3.1, CI 1.08-8.8) were
significant in LN-positive patients. With multivariate Cox regression, MAI was
the only significant predictor of breast cancer-specific survival (HR 7.0, CI
1.7-27.9) in LN-negative patients. In LN-positive patients, both BM DTC-status
and MAI were strong independent predictors of breast cancer-specific survival (HR
3.3, CI 1.25-8.49 and HR 3.1, CI 1.1-8.9), respectively. Where, however, MAI and 
BM DTC-status as single parameters were replaced by a combination of these, this 
showed to be the most significant prognostic marker in both LN-negative (HR 7.7, 
CI 1.2-50) and LN-positive (HR 6.0, CI 1.4 to 26.4) patients with regard to
breast cancer-specific survival. A combination of MAI and BM DTC detection
identified both LN-negative and LN-positive breast cancer patients with poor
prognosis.

TWIST1 is a transcription factor that belongs to the family of basic
helix-loop-helix proteins involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and
invasion processes. The TWIST1 protein possesses oncogenic, drug-resistant,
angiogenic and invasive properties, and has been related with several human
tumors and other pathologies. Colorectal cancer is one of the tumors in which
TWIST1 is over-expressed, but its involvement in the clinical outcome of the
disease is still unclear. We tested, by RT-PCR, the expression levels of TWIST1
in normal and tumor paired-sample tissues from a series of 151 colorectal cancer 
patients, in order to investigate its prognostic value as a tumor marker. TWIST1 
expression was restricted to tumor tissues (86.1%) and correlated with lymph node
metastasis (LNM). Adjusted analysis showed that the expression levels of TWIST1
correlated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).
Importantly, TWIST1 expression levels predicted OS specifically at stages I and
II. Moreover, patients with stage II tumors and high TWIST1 levels showed even
shorter survival than patients with stage III tumors. These results suggest that 
TWIST1 expression levels could be a tumor indicator in stage II patients and help
select patients at greater risk of poor prognosis who might benefit from adjuvant
chemotherapy.

TWIST1 gene, a transcription factor that belongs to the family of basic
helix-loop-helix proteins, has been related to tumor progression and metastasis
in different cancers. The aim of our study was to investigate TWIST1 promoter
methylation in patients with primary colorectal carcinoma and determine its
correlation with prognostic factors and disease outcome. Seventy-three patients
with primary colorectal adenocarcinoma were studied. From each patient two tissue
samples were collected: one sample of the tumor and one sample of normal
colorectal tissue from an area located 15 cm away from the tumor. Samples of
colorectal mucosa obtained from 30 individuals without malignant disease were
also studied as a control group. All tissues were analyzed through
methylation-specific PCR. TWIST1 hypermethylation was detected in colorectal
specimens of 46 patients with cancer, but in none of the tissues from the
nonmalignant control group (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). In cancer patients, TWIST1
hypermethylation was found in 38 of 73 tumor samples as compared with 20 of 73
matched samples of non-cancerous colorectal tissue (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001). TWIST1
hypermethylation was not correlated with prognostic predictors for the disease
outcome, patients' overall survival and disease-free survival rates. We concluded
that TWIST1 hypermethylation is present in the colon and rectum of most patients 
with colorectal carcinoma, suggesting this molecular alteration may be involved
in the process of colorectal carcinogenesis.

Enzymatic activity of free-prostate-specific antigen (f-PSA) is not required for 
some of its physiological activities.

BACKGROUND: Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a well known biomarker for early
diagnosis and management of prostate cancer. Furthermore, PSA has been documented
to have anti-angiogenic and anti-tumorigenic activities in both in vitro and in
vivo studies. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism(s) involved 
in regulation of these processes, in particular the role of the serine-protease
enzymatic activity of PSA.
METHODS: Enzymatic activity of PSA isolated directly from seminal plasma was
inhibited specifically (>95%) by incubation with zinc2+ . Human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVEC) were utilized to compare/contrast the physiological
effects of enzymatically active versus inactive PSA.
RESULTS: Equimolar concentrations of enzymatically active PSA and PSA
enzymatically inactivated by incubation with Zn2+ had similar physiological
effects on HUVEC, including inhibiting the gene expression of pro-angiogenic
growth factors, like VEGF and bFGF, and up-regulation of expression of the
anti-angiogenic growth factor IFN-<U+03B3>; suppression of mRNA expression for markers
of blood vessel development, like FAK, FLT, KDR, TWIST-1; P-38; inhibition of
endothelial tube formation in the in vitro Matrigel Tube Formation Assay; and
inhibition of endothelial cell invasion and migration properties.
DISCUSSION: Our data provides compelling evidence that the transcriptional
regulatory and the anti-angiogenic activities of human PSA are independent of the
innate enzymatic activity.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role and significance of epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and its transcriptional regulator Twist1 in the development of
the human fetal prostate.
METHODS: Twenty-five human fetal prostate specimens at various developmental
stages (16-39 weeks) were included in this study. EMT markers, such as
E-Cadherin, N-Cadherin and Vimentin, and EMT transcriptional regulator Twist1
were determined by immunohistochemistry, and their relationship with the
development of the human fetal prostate was analyzed.
RESULTS: E-Cadherin was expressed in the fetal prostate epithelium only, while
Vimentin, N-Cadherin and Twist1 in both the epithelium and the stroma. The
expression of E-Cadherin gradually increased, but those of Vimentin, N-Cadherin
and Twist1 gradually decreased with the gestation stages. No significant changes 
were observed in the staining patterns of Vimentin, N-Cadherin and Twist1 in the 
stroma during the whole developmental process.
CONCLUSION: EMT is involved in the development of the human fetal prostate, which
may promote epithelial cell motility to form prostatic bud tubules in early
gestation stages and boost the differentiation of prostate epithelia in later
stages.

In our study, whole-genome methylation arrays were applied to identify novel
genes with tumor specific DNA methylation of promoter CpG islands in
pre-malignant and malignant colorectal lesions. Using a combination of Illumina
HumanMethylation27 beadchips, Methylation-Sensitive High Resolution Melting
(MS-HRM) analysis, and Exon arrays (Affymetrix) the DNA methylation pattern of
~14,000 genes and their transcript levels were investigated in six normal
mucosas, six adenomas and 30 MSI and MSS carcinomas. Sixty eight genes with
tumor-specific hypermethylation were identified (p < 0.005). Identified
hypermethylated sites were validated in an independent sample set of eight normal
mucosas, 12 adenomas, 40 MSS and nine MSI cancer samples. The methylation
patterns of 15 selected genes, hypermethylated in adenomas and carcinomas (FLI1, 
ST6GALNAC5, TWIST1, ADHFE1, JAM2, IRF4, CNRIP1, NRG1 and EYA4), in carcinomas
only (ABHD9, AOX1 and RERG), or in MSI but not MSS carcinomas (RAMP2, DSC3 and
MLH1) were validated using MS-HRM. Four of these genes (MLH1, AOX1, EYA4 and
TWIST1) had previously been reported to be hypermethylated in CRC. Eleven genes, 
not previously known to be affected by CRC specific hypermethylation, were
identified and validated. Inverse correlation to gene expression was observed for
six of the 15 genes with Spearman correlation coefficients ranging from -0.39 to 
-0.60. For six of these genes the altered methylation patterns had a profound
transcriptional association, indicating that methylation of these genes may play 
a direct regulatory role. The hypermethylation changes often occurred already in 
adenomas, indicating that they may be used as biomarkers for early detection of
CRC.

Twist1-induced invadopodia formation promotes tumor metastasis.

Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093-0636, USA.

The Twist1 transcription factor is known to promote tumor metastasis and induce
Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). Here, we report that Twist1 is capable
of promoting the formation of invadopodia, specialized membrane protrusions for
extracellular matrix degradation. Twist1 induces PDGFRa expression, which in turn
activates Src, to promote invadopodia formation. We show that Twist1 and PDGFRa
are central mediators of invadopodia formation in response to various
EMT-inducing signals. Induction of PDGFRa and invadopodia is essential for Twist1
to promote tumor metastasis. Consistent with PDGFRa being a direct
transcriptional target of Twist1, coexpression of Twist1 and PDGFRa predicts poor
survival in breast tumor patients. Therefore, invadopodia-mediated matrix
degradation is a key function of Twist1 in promoting tumor metastasis.

In the United States, more than 40% of cancer patients develop brain metastasis. 
The median survival for untreated patients is 1 to 2 months, which may be
extended to 6 months with conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The growth 
and survival of metastasis depend on the interaction of tumor cells with host
factors in the organ microenvironment. Brain metastases are surrounded and
infiltrated by activated astrocytes and are highly resistant to chemotherapy. We 
report here that coculture of human breast cancer cells or lung cancer cells with
murine astrocytes (but not murine fibroblasts) led to the up-regulation of
survival genes, including GSTA5, BCL2L1, and TWIST1, in the tumor cells. The
degree of up-regulation directly correlated with increased resistance to all
tested chemotherapeutic agents. We further show that the up-regulation of the
survival genes and consequent resistance are dependent on the direct contact
between the astrocytes and tumor cells through gap junctions and are therefore
transient. Knocking down these genes with specific small interfering RNA rendered
the tumor cells sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents. These data clearly
demonstrate that host cells in the microenvironment influence the biologic
behavior of tumor cells and reinforce the contention that the organ
microenvironment must be taken into consideration during the design of therapy.

CONTEXT: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is one of the most aggressive human
tumors; it is characterized by chemoresistance, local invasion, and distant
metastases. ATC is invariably fatal.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study the role of TWIST1, a basic helix-loop-helix
transcription factor, in ATC.
DESIGN: Expression of TWIST1 was studied by immunohistochemistry and real-time
PCR in normal thyroids and well-differentiated, poorly differentiated, and ATC.
The function of TWIST1 was studied by RNA interference in ATC cells and by
ectopic expression in well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma cells.
RESULTS: ATCs up-regulate TWIST1 with respect to normal thyroids as well as to
poorly and well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas. Knockdown of TWIST1 by RNA
interference in ATC cells reduced cell migration and invasion and increased
sensitivity to apoptosis. The ectopic expression of TWIST1 in thyroid cells
induced resistance to apoptosis and increased cell migration and invasion.
CONCLUSIONS: TWIST1 plays a key role in determining malignant features of the
anaplastic phenotype in vitro.

Epithelial cancer cells are likely to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) prior to entering the peripheral circulation. By undergoing EMT,
circulating tumor cells (CTCs) lose epithelial markers and may escape detection
by conventional methods. Therefore, we conducted a pilot study to investigate
mRNA transcripts of EMT-inducing transcription factors (TFs) in tumor cells from 
the peripheral blood (PB) of patients with primary breast cancer (PBC). PB
mononuclear cells were isolated from 52 patients with stages I-III PBC and 30
healthy donors (HDs) and were sequentially depleted of EpCAM(+) cells and CD45(+)
leukocytes, henceforth referred to as CD45(-). The expression levels of
EMT-inducing TFs (TWIST1, SNAIL1, SLUG, ZEB1 and FOXC2) in the CD45(-) cells were
determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The highest
level of expression by the CD45(-) cell fraction of HD was used as "cutoff" to
determine if samples from patients with PBC overexpressed any EMT-inducing TFs.
In total, 15.4% of patients with PBC overexpressed at least one of the
EMT-inducing TF transcripts. Overexpression of any EMT-inducing TF transcripts
was more likely to be detected in patients with PBC who received neoadjuvant
therapies (NAT) than patients who received no NAT (p = 0.003). Concurrently, CTCs
were detected in 7 of 38 (18.4%) patients by CellSearch® and in 15 of 42 (35.7%) 
patients by AdnaTest. There was no association between the presence of CTCs
measured by CellSearch® or AdnaTest. In summary, our results demonstrate that
CTCs with EMT phenotype may occur in the peripheral circulation of patients with 
PBC and that NAT is unable to eliminate CTCs undergoing EMT.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of noncoding RNAs that are believed to
be important in many biological processes through regulation of gene expression. 
Little is known of their function in tooth morphogenesis and differentiation.
MicroRNA-214 (miR-214), encoded by the polycistronic Dnm30os gene, is highly
expressed during development of molar tooth germ and was selected as a target for
silencing with anti-miR-214. Mandibular injection of 1-100 pmol of anti-miR-214
close to the developing first molar in newborn mice resulted in significant
decrease in expression of miR-214, miR-466h, and miR-574-5p in the tooth germ.
Furthermore, levels of miR-199a-3p, miR-199a-5p, miR-690, miR-720, and miR-1224
were significantly increased. Additionally, the expression of 863 genes was
significantly increased and the expression of 305 genes was significantly
decreased. Among the genes with increased expression was Twist-1 and Ezh2,
suggested to regulate expression of miR-214. Microarray results were validated
using real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. Among genes with decreased
expression were Amelx, Calb1, Enam, and Prnp; these changes also being reflected 
in levels of corresponding encoded proteins in the tooth germ. In the
anti-miR-214-treated molars the enamel exhibited evidence of hypomineralization
with remnants of organic material and reduced surface roughness after acid
etching, possibly due to the transiently decreased expression of Amelx and Enam. 
In contrast, several genes encoding contractile proteins exhibited significantly 
increased expression. mRNAs involved in amelogenesis (Ambn, Amelx, Enam) were not
found among targets of miRNAs that were differentially expressed following
treatment with anti-miR-214. It is therefore suggested that effects of miR-214 on
amelogenesis are indirect, perhaps mediated by the observed miR-214-dependent
changes in levels of expression of numerous transcription factors.

MicroRNAs are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and 
cancer development. A rare population of hepatocellular cancer stem cells (HSCs) 
holds the extensive proliferative and self-renewal potential necessary to form a 
liver tumour. We postulated that specific transcriptional factors might regulate 
the expression of microRNAs and subsequently modulate the expression of gene
products involved in phenotypic characteristics of HSCs. We evaluated the
expression of microRNA in human HSCs by microarray profiling, and defined the
target genes and functional effects of two groups of microRNA regulated by IL-6
and transcriptional factor Twist. A subset of highly chemoresistant and invasive 
HSCs was screened with aberrant expressions of cytokine IL-6 and Twist. We
demonstrated that conserved let-7 and miR-181 family members were up-regulated in
HSCs by global microarray-based microRNA profiling followed by validation with
real-time polymerase chain reaction. Importantly, inhibition of let-7 increases
the chemosensitivity of HSCs to sorafenib and doxorubicin whereas silencing of
miR-181 led to a reduction in HSCs motility and invasion. Knocking down IL-6 and 
Twist in HSCs significantly reduced let-7 and miR-181 expression and subsequently
inhibited chemoresistance and cell invasion. We showed that let-7 directly
targets SOCS-1 and caspase-3, whereas miR-181 directly targets RASSF1A, TIMP3 as 
well as nemo-like kinase (NLK). In conclusion, alterations of IL-6- and
Twist-regulated microRNA expression in HSCs play a part in tumour spreading and
responsiveness to chemotherapy. Our results define a novel regulatory mechanism
of let-7/miR-181s suggesting that let-7 and miR-181 may be molecular targets for 
eradication of hepatocellular malignancies.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome due to TWIST1 mutations is characterized by coronal
synostosis, facial dysmorphism and additional variable anomalies. Small deletions
comprising the whole TWIST1 account for a small proportion of patients with
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Here we describe 3 patients with facial dysmorphism,
marked microcephaly, short stature (2/3 patients), and overlapping 7p21
microdeletions. Molecular karyotyping identified small deletions of chromosome
7p21 including TWIST1 with a size of 526 kb, 9.2 Mb, and 11.7 Mb, respectively.
The clinical manifestations of these patients do not resemble the typical
phenotype of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. In the two patients with larger
microdeletions, severe mental retardation and significant short stature are
present. Facial dysmorphism of patient 3 includes also signs of
blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome.

Hospital, Jeonju, Jeonbuk, South Korea.

BACKGROUND: The molecular mechanisms of CC (cholangiocarcinoma) oncogenesis and
progression are poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the genome-wide 
expression of genes related to CC oncogenesis and sarcomatous
transdifferentiation.
METHODS: Genes that were differentially expressed between CC cell lines or
tissues and cultured normal biliary epithelial (NBE) cells were identified using 
DNA microarray technology. Expressions were validated in human CC tissues and
cells.
RESULTS: Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of the cell line and
tissue samples, we identified a set of 342 commonly regulated (>2-fold change)
genes. Of these, 53, including tumor-related genes, were upregulated, and 289,
including tumor suppressor genes, were downregulated (<0.5 fold change).
Expression of SPP1, EFNB2, E2F2, IRX3, PTTG1, PPAR<U+03B3>, KRT17, UCHL1, IGFBP7 and
SPARC proteins was immunohistochemically verified in human and hamster CC
tissues. Additional unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of sarcomatoid 
CC cells compared to three adenocarcinomatous CC cell lines revealed 292
differentially upregulated genes (>4-fold change), and 267 differentially
downregulated genes (<0.25 fold change). The expression of 12 proteins was
validated in the CC cell lines by immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemical
staining. Of the proteins analyzed, we found upregulation of the expression of
the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins VIM and TWIST1, and 
restoration of the methylation-silenced proteins LDHB, BNIP3, UCHL1, and NPTX2
during sarcomatoid transdifferentiation of CC.
CONCLUSION: The deregulation of oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and
methylation-related genes may be useful in identifying molecular targets for CC
diagnosis and prognosis.

In humans, a germline mutation (c.309C>G) in the TWIST1 oncogene may predispose
to breast cancer and its expression has been associated with tumour progression
and metastasis. In this study, the feline TWIST1 gene was screened for sequence
variations in 37 neoplastic and eight hyperplastic mammary gland lesions from
cats. In addition, mRNA levels were examined in 15 mammary tumours and three
cases of mammary hyperplasia by quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR.
Feline mammary carcinomas had significantly lower levels of expression of TWIST1 
mRNA than benign mammary tumours. No variations were identified in the TWIST1
coding region in feline mammary tumours and the mutation described in humans was 
not detected. However, two germline variants in the TWIST1 gene intron were
identified in four and three carcinomas, respectively: GQ167299:g.535delG and
GQ167299:g.460C>T. There was no association between these sequence alterations
and TWIST1 mRNA levels.

BACKGROUND: Epitheliomesenchymal transition (EMT) is the process where cancer
cells attain fibroblastic features and are thus able to invade neighboring
tissues. Transcriptional factors zeb1, snai1 and twist regulate EMT.
METHODS: We used immunohistochemistry to investigate the expression of zeb1,
twist and snai1 in tumor and stromal compartments by in a large set of breast
carcinomas. The results were compared with estrogen and progesterone receptor
status, HER2 amplification, grade, histology, TNM status and survival of the
patients.
RESULTS: Nuclear expression for twist was seen in the epithelial tumor cell
compartment in 3.6% and for snai1 in 3.1% of the cases while zeb1 was not
detected at all in these areas. In contrast, the tumor stromal compartment showed
nuclear zeb1 and twist expression in 75% and 52.4% of the cases, respectively.
Although rare, nuclear expression of twist in the epithelial tumor cell
compartment was associated with a poor outcome of the patients (p = 0.054 log
rank, p = 0.013, Breslow, p = 0.025 Tarone-Ware). Expression of snai1, or
expression of zeb1 or twist in the stromal compartment did not have any
prognostic significance. Furthermore, none of these factors associated with the
size of the tumors, nor with the presence of axillary or distant metastases.
Expression of zeb1 and twist in the stromal compartment was positively associated
with a positive estrogen or progesterone receptor status of the tumors. Stromal
zeb1 expression was significantly lower in ductal in situ carcinomas than in
invasive carcinomas (p = 0.020). Medullary carcinomas (p = 0.017) and mucinous
carcinomas (p = 0.009) had a lower stromal expression of zeb1 than ductal
carcinomas. Stromal twist expression was also lower in mucinous (p = 0.017) than 
in ductal carcinomas.
CONCLUSIONS: Expression of transcriptional factors zeb1 and twist mainly occur in
the stromal compartment of breast carcinomas, possibly representing two
populations of cells; EMT transformed neoplastic cells and stromal fibroblastic
cells undergoing activation of zeb1 and twist due to growth factors produced by
the tumor. However, epithelial expression of twist was associated with a poor
prognosis, hinting at its importance in the spread of breast carcinoma.

Functional cooperation between Snail1 and twist in the regulation of ZEB1
expression during epithelial to mesenchymal transition.

Snail1 and Zeb1 are E-cadherin-transcriptional repressors induced during
epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this article we have analyzed the
factors controlling Zeb1 expression during EMT. In NMuMG cells treated with
TGF-ß, Snail1 RNA and protein are induced 1 h after addition of the cytokine
preceding Zeb1 up-regulation that requires 6-8 h. Zeb1 gene expression is caused 
by increased RNA levels but also by enhanced protein stability and is markedly
dependent on Snail1 because depletion of this protein prevents Zeb1 protein and
RNA up-regulation. In addition to Snail1, depletion of the Twist transcriptional 
factor retards Zeb1 stimulation by TGF-ß or decreases Zeb1 expression in other
cellular models indicating that this factor is also required for Zeb1 expression.
Accordingly, Snail1 and Twist cooperate in the induction of Zeb1: co-transfection
of both cDNAs is required for the maximal expression of ZEB1 mRNA. Unexpectedly, 
the expression of Snail1 and Twist shows a mutual dependence although to a
different extent; whereas Twist depletion retards Snail1 up-regulation by TGF-ß, 
Snail1 is necessary for the rapid increase in Twist protein and later
up-regulation of Twist1 mRNA induced by the cytokine. Besides this effect on
Twist, Snail1 also induces the nuclear translocation of Ets1, another factor
required for Zeb1 expression. Both Twist and Ets1 bind to the ZEB1 promoter
although to different elements: whereas Ets1 interacts with the proximal
promoter, Twist does it with a 700-bp sequence upstream of the transcription
start site. These results indicate that Snail1 controls Zeb1 expression at
multiple levels and acts cooperatively with Twist in the ZEB1 gene transcription 
induction.

BACKGROUND: To examine the expression of signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT3) and its activated form (p-STAT3), Twist, and E-cadherin
in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and explore their correlations with HCC
progression and prognosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression profiles of STAT3, p-STAT3, Twist, and
E-cadherin were assessed on 100 clinical HCC samples and 10 normal liver
tissues by using an immunohistochemical staining method, and their correlations
with clinicopathologic parameters and survival of HCC patients were statistically
analyzed.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the positive rate of STAT3, p-STAT3, and
Twist in HCC was significantly higher than that in normal liver tissues;
furthermore, 52% of HCC lesions showed reduced E-cadherin expression. Correlation
analysis indicated that p-STAT3 was positively correlated with Twist expression, 
whereas Twist was negatively correlated with E-cadherin expression; p-STAT3,
Twist, or E-cadherin expression was significantly associated with HCC invasion
and metastasis. Survival analysis showed that HCC patients with p-STAT3, Twist
positive expression, or reduced E-cadherin expression had a significantly shorter
survival duration than those with p-STAT3, Twist negative expression, or those
with normal E-cadherin expression. Multivariate analysis identified p-STAT3,
Twist, or E-cadherin expression as an independent prognostic factor for overall
survival of HCC patients after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: By this study, we suggest that activated STAT3 signal may associate 
with Twist and E-cadherin expression and mediate HCC invasiveness and metastasis;
abnormal p-STAT3/Twist/E-cadherin signal axis may predict poor prognosis of HCC
patients.

BACKGROUND: Determination of the profile of genes that are commonly methylated
aberrantly in colorectal cancer (CRC) will have substantial value for diagnostic 
and therapeutic applications. However, there is limited knowledge of the DNA
methylation pattern in CRC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the methylation profile of 27,578 CpG sites
spanning more than 14,000 genes in CRC and in the adjacent normal mucosa with
bead-chip array-based technology.
RESULTS: We identified 621 CpG sites located in promoter regions and CpG islands 
that were greatly hypermethylated in CRC compared to normal mucosa. The genes on 
chromosome 18 showed promoter hypermethylation most frequently. According to gene
ontology analysis, the most common biologically relevant class of genes affected 
by methylation was the class associated with the cadherin signaling pathway.
Compared to the genome-wide expression array, mRNA expression was more likely to 
be downregulated in the genes demonstrating promoter hypermethylation, even
though this was not statistically significant. We validated ten CpG sites that
were hypermethylated (ADHFE1, BOLL, SLC6A15, ADAMTS5, TFPI2, EYA4, NPY, TWIST1,
LAMA1, GAS7) and 2 CpG sites showing hypomethylation (MAEL, SFT2D3) in CRC
compared to the normal mucosa in the array studies using pyrosequencing. The
methylation status measured by pyrosequencing was consistent with the methylation
array data.
CONCLUSIONS: Methylation profiling based on bead-chip arrays is an effective
method for screening aberrantly methylated genes in CRC. In addition, we
identified novel methylated genes that are candidate diagnostic or prognostic
markers for CRC.

DNA methylation-dependent regulation of TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC genes in human
hepatocellular carcinoma.

Diabetes Institute, Gachon University of Medicine and Science, Incheon, Republic 
of Korea.

The tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) family of neurotrophin receptors, TrkA, TrkB
and TrkC, has been implicated in the growth and survival of human cancers. Here
we report that Trks are frequently overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) from patients and human liver cancer cell lines. To unravel the underlying 
molecular mechanism(s) for this phenomenon, DNA methylation patterns of CpG
islands in TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC genes were examined in normal and cancer cell
lines derived from liver. A good correlation was observed between promoter
hypermethylation and lower expression of TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC genes, which was
supported by the data that inhibiting DNA methylation with 5-azacytidine restored
expression of those genes in normal liver cell lines. Furthermore, Trks promoted 
the proliferation of HepG2 and induced expression of the metastatic regulator,
Twist. These results suggest that Trks may contribute to growth and metastasis of
liver cancer.

Activation of ß-catenin and Akt pathways by Twist are critical for the
maintenance of EMT associated cancer stem cell-like characters.

Li J(1), Zhou BP.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, University of Kentucky
School of Medicine, Lexington, KY 40506, USA.

BACKGROUND: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) not only confers tumor cells 
with a distinct advantage for metastatic dissemination, but also it provides
those cells with cancer stem cell-like characters for proliferation and drug
resistance. However, the molecular mechanism for maintenance of these stem
cell-like traits remains unclear.
METHODS: In this study, we induced EMT in breast cancer MCF7 and cervical cancer 
Hela cells with expression of Twist, a key transcriptional factor of EMT. The
morphological changes associated with EMT were analyzed by immunofluorescent
staining and Western blotting. The stem cell-like traits associated with EMT were
determined by tumorsphere-formation and expression of ALDH1 and CD44 in these
cells. The activation of ß-catenin and Akt pathways was examined by Western
blotting and luciferase assays.
RESULTS: We found that expression of Twist induced a morphological change
associated with EMT. We also found that the cancer stem cell-like traits, such as
tumorsphere formation, expression of ALDH1 and CD44, were significantly elevated 
in Twist-overexpressing cells. Interestingly, we showed that ß-catenin and Akt
pathways were activated in these Twist-overexpressing cells. Activation of
ß-catenin correlated with the expression of CD44. Knockdown of ß-catenin
expression and inhibition of the Akt pathway greatly suppressed the expression of
CD44.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that activation of ß-catenin and Akt pathways
are required for the sustention of EMT-associated stem cell-like traits.

The overall survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains
poor, and the molecular mechanisms underlying HCC progression and aggressiveness 
are unclear. Here, we report that increased expression of p28(GANK) (Gankyrin,
PSMD10, or p28) in human HCC predicts poor survival and disease recurrence after 
surgery. Patients with HCC who have large tumors, with vascular invasion and
intrahepatic or distant metastasis, expressed high levels of p28(GANK) . Invasive
tumors overexpressing p28(GANK) were featured by active epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), and exhibited increased angiogenesis associated with vascular
endothelial growth factor overexpression, whereas silencing p28(GANK) expression 
attenuated EMT and motility/invasion of tumor cells. The p28(GANK) activates
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-V-akt Murine Thymoma Viral Oncogene Homolog
(AKT)-hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF-1a) signaling to promote TWIST1, vascular 
endothelial growth factor, and metalloproteinase 2 expression. Suppression of the
PI3K-AKT-HIF-1a pathway interfered with p28(GANK) -mediated EMT and invasion.
Consistently, we detected a significant correlation between p28(GANK) expression 
and p-AKT levels in a cohort of HCC biopsies, and the combination of these two
parameters is a more powerful predictor of poor prognosis.CONCLUSION: These
results present novel mechanistic insight into a critical role of p28(GANK) in
HCC progression and metastasis.

Craniosynostosis, defined as the premature fusion of the cranial sutures,
presents many challenges in classification and treatment. At least 20% of cases
are caused by specific single gene mutations or chromosome abnormalities. This
article maps out approaches to clinical assessment of a child presenting with an

Unit, Helena Venizelou Hospital, Athens, Greece.

BACKGROUND: Molecular characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is
crucial to identify novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for individualized
therapies. We developed a multiplexed PCR-coupled liquid bead array to detect the
expression of multiple genes in CTCs.
METHODS: mRNA isolated from immunomagnetically enriched CTCs was subjected to
multiplex PCR for KRT19 (keratin 19; also known as CK19), ERBB2 [v-erb-b2
erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2, neuro/glioblastoma derived
oncogene homolog (avian); also known as HER2], SCGB2A2 (secretoglobin, family 2A,
member 2; also known as MGB1, mammaglobin A), MAGEA3 (melanoma antigen family A, 
3), TWIST-1 [twist homolog 1 (Drosophila)], and HMBS (hydroxymethylbilane
synthase; also known as PBGD). Biotinylated amplicons were hybridized against
fluorescent microspheres carrying gene-specific capture probes and incubated with
streptavidin-phycoerythrin. We quantified the captured labeled amplicons and
decoded the beads by Luminex flow cytometry. The assay was validated for limit of
detection, specificity, and comparison with reverse-transcription quantitative
PCR (RT-qPCR), and its clinical performance was evaluated in 64 patients with
operable breast cancer, 20 patients with metastasis, and 17 healthy individuals.
RESULTS: The assay was specific for each gene in complex multiplexed formats and 
could detect the expression of each gene at the level of a single SK-BR-3 cell.
The assay produced results comparable to those for RT-qPCR for each gene. None of
the genes tested was detected in the CTC fraction of healthy donors. We detected 
KRT19, ERBB2, MAGEA3, SCGB2A2, and TWIST1 in 26.6%, 12.5%, 18.7%, 10.9%, and
31.2% of operable breast cancer patients, respectively, and detected the
corresponding genes in 65%, 20%, 30%, 20%, and 20% of patients with verified
metastasis, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The expression of 6 genes in CTCs can be measured simultaneously and
reliably, thereby saving precious sample and reducing the costs and time of
analysis.

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulator Twist1 has been implicated in
tumor invasion, metastasis, and vasculogenic mimicry formation of human
hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the relationship between Twist1 expression and
endothelium-dependent angiogenesis is not clear. In this study, to investigate
the role of Twist1 in hepatocellular carcinoma angiogenesis, we measured the
microvessel density by CD31 immunohistochemistry stain and explored the
microvessel density as an angiogenesis indicator. The microvessel density in
paraffin sections from 97 patients was correlated with Twist1 expression
up-regulation. Nuclear relocation was also identified based on
immunohistochemistry stain, presenting a significant clinical pattern in
hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis and prognosis. Twist1 expression, which is
both located in the cytoplasm and relocated into the nucleus, was associated with
matrix metalloproteinase 9 up-regulation; matrix metalloproteinase 2 did not
appear to present these effects in hepatocellular carcinoma. An assessment of
microvessel density could provide an estimate of the degree of angiogenic
activity in tissues, as well as its association with Twist1 up-regulated
expression. To the best of our knowledge, not only is Twist1 related to
metastasis by tumor cells, but vasculogenic mimicry is also significantly related
to microvessel density; this process is also associated with matrix
metalloproteinase 9 up-regulated expression. This work provides a better
understanding of the role of Twist1 in hepatocellular carcinoma angiogenesis and 
metastasis, suggesting that our findings could represent tumor cell
epithelial-mesenchymal transition and endothelium-dependent angiogenesis, as can 
be seen in hepatocellular carcinoma.

Snail2 is an essential mediator of Twist1-induced epithelial mesenchymal
transition and metastasis.

To metastasize, carcinoma cells must attenuate cell-cell adhesion to disseminate 
into distant organs. A group of transcription factors, including Twist1, Snail1, 
Snail2, ZEB1, and ZEB2, have been shown to induce epithelial mesenchymal
transition (EMT), thus promoting tumor dissemination. However, it is unknown
whether these transcription factors function independently or coordinately to
activate the EMT program. Here we report that direct induction of Snail2 is
essential for Twist1 to induce EMT. Snail2 knockdown completely blocks the
ability of Twist1 to suppress E-cadherin transcription. Twist1 binds to an
evolutionarily conserved E-box on the proximate Snail2 promoter to induce its
transcription. Snail2 induction is essential for Twist1-induced cell invasion and
distant metastasis in mice. In human breast tumors, the expression of Twist1 and 
Snail2 is highly correlated. Together, our results show that Twist1 needs to
induce Snail2 to suppress the epithelial branch of the EMT program and that
Twist1 and Snail2 act together to promote EMT and tumor metastasis.

Quantitative DNA methylation and recurrence of breast cancer: a study of 30
candidate genes.

K, Ahmad AS, Duffy S, Cuzick JM, Lorincz AT.

BACKGROUND: The need for new prognostic factors in breast cancer is ever
increasing as breast cancer management evolves. Aberrant DNA methylation plays a 
pivotal role in cancer development and progression; DNA methylation-based
biomarkers may provide independent prognostic information. We used pyrosequencing
to investigate the prognostic potential of quantitative DNA methylation of a
large set of candidate genes in a Korean single-institution series of operable
breast cancer.
METHODS: Absolute DNA methylation in 20 candidate genes from an initial set of 30
genes was measured by pyrosequencing of bisulfite converted DNA in 121 fresh
frozen breast cancer cases. Survival analyses used continuous and categorized
(quintile-based) gene methylation data with time to recurrence (TTR) as an
endpoint. Prognostic abilities of gene-only and risk-score models were explored.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 5.1 years; 25 recurrences (21%) were observed.
Nodal status, methylation of TWIST1, SLIT2 (both as continuous and categorized
variables) and APC, HLA-A, NKX2-5, SERPINB5, SFN (as categorized variables) were 
significantly prognostic; grade showed a prognostic trend. A multivariate model
containing nodal status, grade and TWIST1 was a best fit (p< 0.001) in stepwise
regression; risk-score based on this model separated patients into 3 distinct
risk-groups (p< 0.001). A gene-only model based on TWIST1 and SFN also classified
patients into distinct risk-groups (p=0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that accurate quantitative measurement of DNA
methylation by pyrosequencing identifies a small set of genes with independent
prognostic potential in breast cancer. These genes complement the current
clinico-pathological prognostic factors and appear to be potential biomarkers
that warrant further validation.

TGF-ß induces sustained upregulation of SNAI1 and SNAI2 through Smad and non-Smad
pathways in a human corneal epithelial cell line.

K, Fujita Y, Shimomura Y, Nishio K.

Japan.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression changes of
epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related molecules induced by TGF-ß
signaling in a human corneal epithelial cell line (HCECs).
METHODS: The cellular response to TGF-ß was evaluated by immunoblotting,
quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence microscopy in HCECs.
RESULTS: TGF-ß significantly increased mRNA expression of SNAI1, SNAI2, VIM, and 
FN1, but not TWIST1 through Smad and non-Smad pathways in HCECs. Protein
expression of a mesenchymal marker N-cadherin was dose-dependently increased and 
that of an epithelial marker of E-cadherin was decreased by TGF-ß. TGF-ß, but not
EGF, mediated the EMT-like morphologic changes. Both TGF-ß and EGF were capable
of upregulating SNAI1 and SNAI2 by about two-fold within a short response time.
However, a detailed time course analysis revealed drastically different
expression patterns, with TGF-ß mediating a sustained upregulation of SNAI1 and
SNAI2 for at least for 6 days and EGF allowing a return to the baseline
expression values after 8 ~ 12 h. These data indicate that TGF-ß, but not EGF,
induces sustained upregulation of SNAI1 and SNAI2 in HCECs.
CONCLUSIONS: TGF-ß induces sustained upregulation of SNAI1 and SNAI2 through Smad
and non-Smad pathways, EMT-like morphologic changes, downregulation of
E-cadherin, and upregulation of N-cadherin in HCECs. The authors' findings
provide insight into the TGF-ß signaling and the temporal expression patterns of 
EMT-inducible transcription factors in HCECs.

(1)Department of Biomedical Sciences, Baylor College of Dentistry, Texas A&M
University Health Sciences Center, Dallas, TX 75246, USA. mserrano@bcd.tamhsc.edu

OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to examine if Twist and Notch 1 are 
present in the mandibular condylar cartilage (MCC) and whether their gene
expression can be altered by exogenous FGF-2 and TGF-ß2.
DESIGN: Half-heads from CD-1 mice pups harvested at embryonic day 17 (E17) were
fixed, decalcified, and sectioned in the sagittal plane for immunohistochemical
detection of Notch and Twist using confocal microscopy. Other mandibular condyles
and adjacent ramus from E17 mice were cultured in serum-free DMEM containing 0,
3, or 30 ng/mL of FGF-2 (10-12 condyles per treatment group). This experimental
design was repeated with medium containing 0, 3, or 30 ng/mL of TGF-ß2. After 3
days of culture, the pooled RNA from each group was extracted for examination of 
Notch and Twist gene expression using quantitative real-time RT-PCR.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemical examination revealed that Notch and Twist were
localized to the prechondroblastic and upper chondroblastic layers of the
cartilage. Exogenous FGF-2 up-regulated Notch 1, Twist 1 and Twist 2 gene
expression in MCC explants from E17 mice, whilst TGF-ß2 had the opposite effect.
CONCLUSIONS: The gene expression data demonstrate that MCC explants are sensitive
to growth factors known to affect Notch and Twist in other tissues. The subset of
cells in which Twist and Notch immunoreactivity was found is suggestive of a role
for FGF-2 and TGF-ß2 as regulators of cell differentiation of the bipotent MCC
cell population, consistent with the role of Notch and Twist as downstream
mediators of these growth factors in other tissues.

PURPOSE: Invasion and metastasis are key steps in the progression of urothelial
cancer (UC) into a critical disease. Foxo3a is a member of the Foxo transcription
factor family that modulates the expression of various genes. We aimed to
elucidate the role of Foxo3a in UC invasion.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Foxo3a mRNA and protein expressions in UC samples were
investigated by gene expression assays and immunohistochemistry, respectively.
Foxo3a expression was compared with clinicopathologic characteristics and patient
prognoses based on UC samples. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, 
Western blotting, and migration assays were also conducted in UC cells.
RESULTS: Foxo3a expression decreased in invasive UC; patients with low Foxo3a
expression had poor disease-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and overall 
survival; Foxo3a knockdown in UC cells increased cellular motility. Foxo3a
negatively regulated Twist1 and Y-box-binding protein 1 (YB-1), and positively
regulated E-cadherin in KK47 and TCCsup cells that expressed Twist1, but not in
T24 cells that did not express Twist1. Foxo3a-associated acetyltransferase p300
and Foxo3a acetylation status also affected UC motility.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that Foxo3a regulates motility of 
UC through negative regulation of Twist1 and YB-1, and through positive
regulation of E-cadherin. This suggests that Foxo3a could act as an independent
prognostic factor in UC and could represent a promising molecular target for
cancer therapeutics.

Zeb1 and twist are more commonly expressed in metastatic than primary lung
tumours and show inverse associations with claudins.

Center, Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.

BACKGROUND: Zeb1 and twist regulate expression of genes which take part in
epitheliomesenchymal transition (EMT). Claudins are tight junctional proteins
regulating polarity and paracellular permeability of epithelial cells.
AIMS AND METHODS: To study Zeb1 and twist in 289 primary and 54 metastatic lung
tumours and their relation to expression of claudins 1-5 and 7 by
immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Metastatic tumours showed a significantly lower expression of zeb1 and
twist (33.0% and 38.0% vs 5.0% and 14.5%, p<0.001 for both) and they also had a
significantly lower expression of claudin 1 (p<0.001), claudin 4 (p<0.001),
claudin 5 (p=0.001) and claudin 7 (p<0.001) than did primary tumours. Primary
lung tumours showed a strong inverse association between zeb1 and claudin 1
(p=0.024) and claudin 2 (p=0.003). For twist an inverse association was found
with claudin 5 (p=0.007). In metastatic tumours zeb1 was inversely associated
with claudin 7 (p=0.050) and twist with claudin 5 (p=0.025). Overexpression of
claudin 5 was associated with decreased survival (p=0.017). For zeb1 or twist, no
association with survival was observed in primary or metastatic tumours.
CONCLUSIONS: According to protein expression, involvement of zeb1 and twist in
EMT in primary lung tumours is relatively infrequent. Carcinomas metastatic to
the lung showed a significantly higher expression of these transcriptional
factors than primary lung tumours, indicating their probable importance in the
metastatic process. Zeb1 and twist were inversely associated with several
claudins, indicating a role in their down-regulation.

Aberrant DNA methylation is an early event in carcinogenesis and could serve as
an additional molecular marker for the early diagnosis. The study was performed
to investigate the promoter methylation of DAPK1, CDH13, and TWIST1 genes in
uterine cervix lesions in an effort to examine whether this epigenetic event is
involved in the process of cervical carcinogenesis, and whether it might be used 
as a molecular marker of cervical lesions. We conducted a retrospective study of 
60 uterine cervix specimens, including 8 normal tissue samples, 10 benign
lesions, 28 precancerous lesions (CIN1-3), and 14 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC).
DNA hypermethylation was investigated using methylation-specific PCR.
Immunohistochemistry was used to find p16(INK4A) overexpression. No
hypermethylated promoters were detected in normal tissues and benign lesions.
However, promoter hypermethylation of CDH13, TWIST1, and DAPK1 increased
progressively from CIN1 to cancer, reaching values higher than 50% for cancer.
DAPK1 and CDH13 displayed a significantly increased frequency of promoter
methylation with progressively more severe cervical neoplasia (p<0.05). A
statistically significant association was observed between p16(INK4A) expression 
and hypermethylation of DAPK1, TWIST1, and CDH13 (p<0.0001). Hypermethylation of 
CDH13, DAPK1, and TWIST1 promoters is an early event in the initiation and
progression of cervix neoplasia. CDH13, DAPK1, and TWIST1 genes are potential
biomarkers of cervical cancer risk.

factor in chronic myeloid leukemia.

The mechanisms of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML) often remain obscure. Analysis of patient samples during
disease progression revealed the up-regulation of the oncogene TWIST-1, also
measured in primary samples from TKI-resistant patients. Moreover, we found that 
TWIST-1 was overexpressed in CML diagnostic samples of patients who later
developed cytogenetic resistance to imatinib, even those without any detectable
resistance mechanism. We confirmed the up-regulation of TWIST-1 at both RNA and
protein levels in imatinib-resistant cell lines, irrespective of any other
resistance mechanism. Analysis with specific small interfering RNA suggested
TWIST-1 involvement in the resistance phenotype. Finally, the kinetics of TWIST-1
expression during the individual medical histories of CML patients indicated that
TWIST-1 expression is down-regulated by TKIs and up-regulated with TKI
resistance. We hypothesize that the overexpression of the TWIST-1 oncogene
represents a novel key prognostic factor potentially useful for optimizing CML
management in the TKI era.

Growth and differentiation factor 9 (GDF-9) induces epithelial-mesenchymal
transition in prostate cancer cells.

The role of bone morphogenetic proteins in the progression and metastasis of
prostate cancer is a topic that has undergone extensive research. This study
investigates the role of BMP member growth and differentiation factor 9 (GDF-9)
in the progression of this disease. GDF-9 was over-expressed and knocked-down in 
PC-3 cells, respectively. Furthermore, along with the use of a generated
recombinant GDF-9 protein, these cells were then analyzed for any changes in
their invasiveness and expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
associated genes. GDF-9 was shown to promote the invasiveness of PC-3 cells
together with an induction in the expression of genes including SNAI1, RhoC,
ROCK-1, and N-cadherin, while reducing levels of E-cadherin. These expression
changes are characteristic of the onset of EMT, and resulted in the cells having 
a more mesenchymal-like morphology. Treating these cells with activin-like
kinase-5 (ALK-5) inhibitor, demonstrated that GDF-9 induced up-regulation of
these molecules was ALK-5 dependant. This study shows that in PC-3 cells, GDF-9
signaling via ALK-5, can promote cell invasiveness via a complex network of
signaling molecules that work together to trigger the process of EMT, and thereby
aid in the aggressiveness and progression of prostate cancer cells.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of peritoneal mesothelial cells is a
pathological process that occurs during peritoneal dialysis. EMT leads to
peritoneal fibrosis, ultrafiltration failure and eventually to the
discontinuation of therapy. Signaling pathways involved in mesothelial EMT are
thus of great interest, but are mostly unknown. We used primary mesothelial cells
from human omentum to analyze the role of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway in the
induction of EMT. The use of specific inhibitors, a dominant-negative p38 mutant 
and lentiviral silencing of p38a demonstrated that p38 promotes E-cadherin
expression both in untreated cells and in cells co-stimulated with the
EMT-inducing stimuli transforming growth factor (TGF)-ß1 and interleukin (IL)-1ß.
p38 inhibition also led to disorganization and downregulation of cytokeratin
filaments and zonula occludens (ZO)-1, whereas expression of vimentin was
increased. Analysis of transcription factors that repress E-cadherin expression
showed that p38 blockade inhibited expression of Snail1 while increasing
expression of Twist. Nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of p65
NF-<U+03BA>B, an important inducer of EMT, was increased by p38 inhibition. Moreover,
p38 inhibition increased the phosphorylation of TGF-ß-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), 
NF-<U+03BA>B and I<U+03BA>Ba. The effect of p38 inhibition on E-cadherin expression was rescued
by modulating the TAK1-NF-<U+03BA>B pathway. Our results demonstrate that p38 maintains 
E-cadherin expression by suppressing TAK1-NF-<U+03BA>B signaling, thus impeding the
induction of EMT in human primary mesothelial cells. This represents a novel role
of p38 as a brake or 'gatekeeper' of EMT induction by maintaining E-cadherin
levels.

Metformin against TGFß-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT): from
cancer stem cells to aging-associated fibrosis.

Transforming Growth Factor-b (TGFb) is a major driving force of the
Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal (EMT) genetic program, which becomes overactive in the 
pathophysiology of many age-related human diseases.  TGFb-driven EMT is
sufficient to generate migrating cancer stem cells by directly linking the
acquisition of cellular motility with the maintenance of tumor-initiating
(stemness) capacity.  Chronic diseases exhibiting excessive fibrosis can be
caused by repeated and sustained infliction of TGFb-driven EMT, which increases
collagen and extracellular matrix synthesis.  Pharmacological prevention and/or
reversal of TGFb-induced EMT may therefore have important clinical applications
in the management of cancer metastasis as well as in the prevention and/or
treatment of end-state organ failures.  Earlier studies from our group have
revealed that clinically-relevant concentrations of the biguanide derivative
metformin, the most widely used oral agent to lower blood glucose concentration
in patients with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, notably decreased both
the self-renewal and the proliferation of trastuzumab-refractory breast cancer
stem cell populations.  Given that: a.) tumor-initiating cancer stem cells
display a significant enrichment in the expression of basal/mesenchymal or
myoepithelial markers, including an increased secretion of TGFb; b.) metformin
treatment impedes the ontogeny of generating the stem cell phenotype by
transcriptionally repressing key drivers of the EMT genetic program (e.g. ZEB1,
TWIST1, SNAIL2 [Slug], TGFbs), we recently hypothesized that prevention of
TGFb-induced EMT might represent a common molecular mechanism underlying the
anti-cancer stem cells and anti-fibrotic actions of metformin.  Remarkably,
metformin exposure not only impedes TGFb-promoted loss of the epithelial marker
E-cadherin in MCF-7 breast cancer cells but it prevents further TGF-induced cell 
scattering and accumulation of the mesenchymal marker vimentin in Madin-Darby
canine kidney (MDCK) cells.  We now propose that metformin, by weakening the
ability of TGFb signaling to fully induce mesenchymal cell states in a variety of
pathological processes including fibrosis (e.g. chronic renal disease,
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, heart failure or sclerosis) and malignant
progression (and likely by reducing TGFb-regulated inflammation and immune
responses -inflamm-aging-), molecularly behaves as a bona fide anti-aging
modality.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the roles of Twist1 and Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) 
and their potential as therapeutic targets in bladder cancer (BC), as both have
been suggested to play important roles in tumour growth, invasion and drug
resistance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bladder cancer cell lines (TCCsup, UMUC3, T24 and KK47
cells) were used. Twist1 and YB-1 expression levels were assessed by luciferase
reporter assay, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
western blot analysis. Tumour growth and cell cycle were analysed by cell
proliferation assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Invasive and motile
abilities were investigated by scratch-wound test and migration assay,
respectively. Cytotoxicity assay was performed to determine drug sensitivity.
RESULTS: The findings showed that Twist1 regulated YB-1 expression in BC cells.
Both Twist1 and YB-1 were involved in cell growth, invasion, motility and
resistance to cisplatin and doxorubicin, but not to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).
CONCLUSION: The present study showed that Twist1 regulates YB-1 expression and
that both Twist1 and YB-1 promote malignant potentials, including tumour growth, 
invasion and anti-cancer-drug resistance, indicating that both Twist1 and YB-1
are novel molecular targets in BC.

Oncogenic KRas suppresses inflammation-associated senescence of pancreatic ductal
cells.

Mutational activation of KRas is the first and most frequently detected genetic
lesion in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, the precise role of
oncogenic KRas in the pathogenesis of PDAC is not fully understood. Here, we
report that the endogenous expression of oncogenic KRas suppresses premature
senescence in primary pancreatic duct epithelial cells (PDEC). Oncogenic
KRas-mediated senescence bypass is conferred by the upregulation of the basic
helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist that in turn abrogates p16(INK4A)
induction. Moreover, the KRas-Twist-p16(INK4A) senescence bypass pathway is
employed in vivo to prevent inflammation-associated senescence of pancreatic
ductal epithelium. Our findings indicate that oncogenic KRas could contribute to 
PDAC initiation by protecting cells from entering a state of permanent growth
arrest.

Digital gene expression tag profiling of bat digits provides robust candidates
contributing to wing formation.

University, Shanghai 200062, PR China.

BACKGROUND: As the only truly flying mammals, bats use their unique wing -
consisting of four elongated digits (digits II-V) connected by membranes - to
power their flight. In addition to the elongated digits II-V, the forelimb
contains one shorter digit (digit I) that is morphologically similar to the
hindlimb digits. Here, we capitalized on the morphological variation among the
bat forelimb digits to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying digit
elongation and wing formation. Using next generation sequencing technology, we
performed digital gene expression tag profiling (DGE-tag profiling) of developing
digits in a pooled sample of two Myotis ricketti and validated our sequencing
results using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) of gene expression in the
developing digits of two Hipposideros armiger.
RESULTS: Among hundreds of genes exhibiting significant differences in expression
between the short and long digits, we highlight 14 genes most related to digit
elongation. These genes include two Tbx genes (Tbx3 and Tbx15), five BMP pathway 
genes (Bmp3, RGMB, Smad1, Smad4 and Nog), four Homeobox genes (Hoxd8, Hoxd9,
Hoxa1 and Satb1), and three other genes (Twist1, Tmeff2 and Enpp2) related to
digit malformations or cell proliferation. In addition, our results suggest that 
Tbx4 and Pitx2 contribute to the morphological similarity and five genes (Acta1, 
Tnnc2, Atp2a1, Hrc and Myoz1) contribute to the functional similarity between the
thumb and hindlimb digits.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study not only implicate many developmental genes as
robust candidates underlying digit elongation and wing formation in bats, but
also provide a better understanding of the genes involved in autopodial
development in general.

The medial epithelial seam (MES) between the palatal shelves degrades during
palatal fusion to achieve the confluence of palatal mesenchyme. Cellular
mechanisms underlying the degradation of MES have been proposed, such as
apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration of medial edge
epithelia (MEE). Extracellular matrix components have been shown to play an
important role in EMT in many model systems. Periostin (also known as
osteoblast-specific factor-2) is a secreted mesenchymal extracellular matrix
component that affects the ability of cells to migrate and/or facilitates EMT
during both embryonic development and pathologic conditions. In this study, we
evaluated the spatiotemporal expression patterns of periostin during mouse
palatal fusion by in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence. Periostin mRNA
and protein were present in the palatal mesenchyme, the protein being distributed
in a fine fibrillar network and in the basement membrane, but absent from the
epithelium. During MES degradation, the protein was strongly expressed in the
basement membrane underlying the MES and in some select MEE. Confocal microscopic
analysis using an EMT marker, twist1, and an epithelial marker, cytokeratin 14,
provided evidence that select MEE were undergoing EMT in association with
periostin. Moreover, the major extracellular matrix molecules in basement
membrane, laminin and collagen type IV were degraded earlier than periostin. The 
result is that select MEE establish interactions with periostin in the
mesenchymal extracellular matrix, and these new cell-matrix interactions may
regulate MEE transdifferentiation during palatal fusion.

TWIST1 is thought to be a novel oncogene. Understanding the molecular mechanisms 
regulating the TWIST1 gene expression profiles in tumor cells may give new
insights regarding prognostic factors and novel therapeutic targets in veterinary
oncology. In the present study we partially isolated the TWIST1 gene in Felis
catus and performed comparative studies. Several primer combinations were used
based on the alignments of homologous DNA sequences. After PCR amplification,
three bands were obtained, purified and sequenced. Several bioinformatic tools
were utilized to carry out the comparative studies. Higher similarity was found
between the isolated TWIST1 gene in Felis catus and Homo sapiens (86%) than
between Homo sapiens and Rattus norvegicus or Mus musculus (75%). Partial amino
acid sequence showed no change in the four species analyzed. This confirmed that 
coding sequences presented high similarity (~96%) between man and cat. These
results give the first insights regarding the TWIST1 gene in cat but further
studies are required in order to establish, or not, its role in tumor formation
and progression in veterinary oncology.

The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental process
enabling epithelial cells to gain a migratory mesenchymal phenotype. In cancer,
this process contributes to metastases; however the regulatory signals and
mechanistic details are not fully elucidated. Here, we sought to identify the
subset of genes regulated in lung cancer by ZEB1, an E-box transcriptional
repressor known to induce EMT. Using an Affymetrix-based expression database of
38 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, we identified 324 genes that
correlated negatively with ZEB1 and 142 that were positively correlated. A
mesenchymal gene pattern (low E-cadherin, high Vimentin or N-cadherin) was
significantly associated with ZEB1 and ZEB2, but not with Snail, Slug, Twist1 or 
Twist2. Among eight genes selected for validation, seven were confirmed to
correlate with ZEB1 by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in a series of 22 NSCLC cell
lines, either negatively (CDS1, EpCAM, ESRP1, ESRP2, ST14) or positively (FGFR1, 
Vimentin). In addition, over-expression or knockdown of ZEB1 led to corresponding
changes in gene expression, demonstrating that these genes are also regulated by 
ZEB1, either directly or indirectly. Of note, the combined knockdown of ZEB1 and 
ZEB2 led to apparent synergistic responses in gene expression. Furthermore, these
responses were not restricted to artificial settings, since most genes were
similarly regulated during a physiologic induction of EMT by TGF-ß plus EGF.
Finally, the absence of ST14 (matriptase) was linked to ZEB1 positivity in lung
cancer tissue microarrays, implying that the regulation observed in vitro applies
to the human disease. In summary, this study identifies a new set of
ZEB-regulated genes in human lung cancer cells and supports the hypothesis that
ZEB1 and ZEB2 are key regulators of the EMT process in this disease.

Bypass mechanisms of the androgen receptor pathway in therapy-resistant prostate 
cancer cell models.

Marques RB(1), Dits NF, Erkens-Schulze S, van Weerden WM, Jenster G.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Josephine Nefkens Institute, Erasmus Medical Center,
Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is initially dependent on androgens for survival and 
growth, making hormonal therapy the cornerstone treatment for late-stage tumors. 
However, despite initial remission, the cancer will inevitably recur. The present
study was designed to investigate how androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells
eventually survive and resume growth under androgen-deprived and antiandrogen
supplemented conditions. As model system, we used the androgen-responsive PC346C 
cell line and its therapy-resistant sublines: PC346DCC, PC346Flu1 and PC346Flu2.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Microarray technology was used to analyze
differences in gene expression between the androgen-responsive and
therapy-resistant PC346 cell lines. Microarray analysis revealed 487 transcripts 
differentially-expressed between the androgen-responsive and the
therapy-resistant cell lines. Most of these genes were common to all three
therapy-resistant sublines and only a minority (~5%) was androgen-regulated.
Pathway analysis revealed enrichment in functions involving cellular movement,
cell growth and cell death, as well as association with cancer and reproductive
system disease. PC346DCC expressed residual levels of androgen receptor (AR) and 
showed significant down-regulation of androgen-regulated genes (p-value =
10(-7)). Up-regulation of VAV3 and TWIST1 oncogenes and repression of the DKK3
tumor-suppressor was observed in PC346DCC, suggesting a potential AR bypass
mechanism. Subsequent validation of these three genes in patient samples
confirmed that expression was deregulated during prostate cancer progression.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Therapy-resistant growth may result from adaptations in
the AR pathway, but androgen-independence may also be achieved by alternative
survival mechanisms. Here we identified TWIST1, VAV3 and DKK3 as potential
players in the bypassing of the AR pathway, making them good candidates as
biomarkers and novel therapeutical targets.

University of Barcelona, 08025 Barcelona, Spain.

It has been suggested that down-regulation of E-cadherin in invasive breast
ductal carcinomas is mediated by the aberrant expression of several of its
transcriptional repressors, but their inhibitory role and clinical importance are
not yet well established. We investigated gene and protein expression patterns of
the E-cadherin repressors SNAIL, ZEB1, and TWIST in relation to clinicopathologic
parameters, in a series of 88 patients with invasive breast ductal carcinomas.
Up-regulation of SNAIL messenger RNA (P = .008) and down-regulation of TWIST (P =
.022) were associated with triple-negative tumors, whereas ZEB1 gene expression
was more frequent in hormone-positive tumors (P = .004). Loss of E-cadherin was
found in 19% of the tumors, but it did not correlate with aberrant expression of 
any of the repressors investigated herein. Nonetheless, we found that ZEB-1
protein overexpression inversely correlated with high tumor grade (P = .018),
nuclear grade (P = .002), and presence of lymph nodes (P = .001), and these data 
were consistent with the gene expression data for ZEB1. Clinically,
down-regulation of ZEB1 messenger RNA was associated with poor overall survival
(P = .011) and disease-free survival (P = .053), whereas patients with TWIST
negative tumors had a worse overall survival (P = .008) and disease-free survival
(P = .006). Our data indicate that deregulation of TWIST is somehow important in 
the aggressiveness of triple-negative carcinomas and poor patient outcome,
whereas down-regulation of ZEB1 seems to play a role in tumor spread, metastases,
and poor survival.

Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) with expression of stem/progenitor cell markers 
including CD133 have been reported to have more aggressive biological behavior,
and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), closely related invasion, has been
suggested to generate cancer stem cells. To elucidate biological characteristics 
of HCCs expressing CD133, we evaluated migration assay and the mRNA expression
levels of CD133, invasion-associated genes [urokinase plasminogen activator
receptor (uPAR), villin 2 (VIL2), and MMP1 and MMP2], and EMT regulators (Snail, 
Slug, Twist, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin) by real-time PCR in HCC cell lines
including HepG2, Hep3B, Huh7, PLC/RFP/6, SNU423, SNU449, and SNU475. Same genes
and pathological features were also investigated in 49 samples of hepatitis B
virus-related human HCCs. In all HCC cell lines studied, CD133-positive cells
showed higher cell migration activity and up-regulated invasion- and
EMT-associated genes with increased N-cadherin and decreased E-cadherin
expressions compared to CD133-negative cells. The human HCCs were divided into
the CD133-high group (top 40%) and the CD133-low group (bottom 40%) according to 
the level of CD133 mRNA. The CD133-high group showed relatively frequent vascular
invasion and significantly higher expression of invasion-associated genes [uPAR
(p=0.002), MMP1 (p=0.01), and MMP2 (p=0.003)] and EMT regulators [Snail (p=0.002)
and Twist (p=0.0003)] compared to the CD133-low group. In conclusion, our results
suggest that there is a subtype of HCC with high expression of CD133, which might
have more invasive characteristics by up-regulation of invasion-associated genes 
and EMT-associated genes.

Tissue transglutaminase promotes drug resistance and invasion by inducing
mesenchymal transition in mammary epithelial cells.

Kumar A(1), Xu J, Brady S, Gao H, Yu D, Reuben J, Mehta K.

(1)Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M. D.

Recent observations that aberrant expression of tissue transglutaminase (TG2)
promotes growth, survival, and metastasis of multiple tumor types is of great
significance and could yield novel therapeutic targets for improved patient
outcomes. To accomplish this, a clear understanding of how TG2 contributes to
these phenotypes is essential. Using mammary epithelial cell lines (MCF10A,
MCF12A, MCF7 and MCF7/RT) as a model system, we determined the impact of TG2
expression on cell growth, cell survival, invasion, and differentiation. Our
results show that TG2 expression promotes drug resistance and invasive functions 
by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Thus, TG2 expression
supported anchorage-independent growth of mammary epithelial cells in soft-agar, 
disrupted the apical-basal polarity, and resulted in disorganized acini
structures when grown in 3D-culture. At molecular level, TG2 expression resulted 
in loss of E-cadherin and increased the expression of various transcriptional
repressors (Snail1, Zeb1, Zeb2 and Twist1). Tumor growth factor-beta (TGF-ß)
failed to induce EMT in cells lacking TG2 expression, suggesting that TG2 is a
downstream effector of TGF-ß-induced EMT. Moreover, TG2 expression induced stem
cell-like phenotype in mammary epithelial cells as revealed by enrichment of
CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) cell populations. Overall, our studies show that aberrant
expression of TG2 is sufficient for inducing EMT in epithelial cells and
establish a strong link between TG2 expression and progression of metastatic
breast disease.

CONTEXT: Twist1 is a transcription factor implicated in the regulation of TNFa
signaling and was recently shown to be highly expressed in both human and murine 
adipose tissue, but its role in obesity is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the expression of twist1 in human white
adipose tissue (WAT), its relationship to obesity and insulin sensitivity, and
how it modifies TNFa-mediated inflammation in adipocytes.
PROCEDURE: Twist mRNA levels were measured in WAT from 130 nonobese and obese
subjects, and its relation to clinical parameters was assessed. Twist1 expression
was measured before and after weight loss as well as in different adipose
regions. Human in vitro differentiated adipocytes were treated with TNFa under
control conditions or after twist1 gene silencing by RNA interference. Gene
expression and secretion of proinflammatory proteins were measured.
RESULTS: Twist1 expression was low in obese subjects and increased after weight
loss. Twist1 mRNA levels correlated with adiponectin levels and inversely with
insulin resistance as well as adipocyte volume (P < 0.001 for all). Low twist1
expression associated with a hypertrophic adipose tissue and high secretion of
TNFa and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 from WAT. Finally, twist1 silencing
in human adipocytes enhanced TNFa-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1
expression and secretion, which was paralleled by an increase in the mRNA
expression of the nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B gene RelA.
CONCLUSIONS: Low twist1 expression in human WAT correlates with obesity and an
insulin-resistant phenotype, which may be mediated by an increased sensitivity to
the proinflammatory effect of TNFa.

Redundant or separate entities?--roles of Twist1 and Twist2 as molecular switches
during gene transcription.

Twist1 and Twist2 are highly conserved members of the Twist subfamily of bHLH
proteins responsible for the transcriptional regulation of the developmental
programs in mesenchymal cell lineages. The regulation of such processes requires 
that Twist1 and Twist2 function as molecular switches to activate and repress
target genes by employing several direct and indirect mechanisms. Modes of action
by these proteins include direct DNA binding to conserved E-box sequences and
recruitment of coactivators or repressors, sequestration of E-protein modulators,
and interruption of proper activator/repressor function through protein-protein
interactions. Regulatory outcomes of Twist1 and Twist2 are themselves controlled 
by spatial-temporal expression, phosphoregulation, dimer choice and cellular
localization. Although these two proteins are highly conserved and exhibit
similar functions in vitro, emerging literature have demonstrated different roles
in vivo. The involvement of Twist1 and Twist2 in a broad spectrum of regulatory
pathways highlights the importance of understanding their roles in normal
development, homeostasis and disease. Here we focus on the mechanistic models of 
transcriptional regulation and summarize the similarities and differences between
Twist1 and Twist2 in the context of myogenesis, osteogenesis, immune system
development and cancer.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition promotes tubulin detyrosination and
microtentacles that enhance endothelial engagement.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with increased breast
tumor metastasis; however, the specific mechanisms by which EMT promotes
metastasis remain somewhat unclear. Despite the importance of cytoskeletal
dynamics during both EMT and metastasis, very few current studies examine the
cytoskeleton of detached and circulating tumor cells. Specific posttranslational 
a-tubulin modifications are critical for adherent cell motility and implicated in
numerous pathologies, but also remain understudied in detached cells. We report
here that EMT induced through ectopic expression of Twist or Snail promotes
a-tubulin detyrosination and the formation of tubulin-based microtentacles in
detached HMLEs. Mechanistically, EMT downregulates the tubulin tyrosine ligase
enzyme, resulting in an accumulation of detyrosinated a-tubulin (Glu-tubulin),
and increases microtentacles that penetrate endothelial layers to facilitate
tumor cell reattachment. Confocal microscopy shows that microtentacles are
capable of penetrating the junctions between endothelial cells. Suppression of
endogenous Twist in metastatic human breast tumor cells is capable of reducing
both tubulin detyrosination and microtentacles. Clinical breast tumor samples
display high concordance between Glu-tubulin and Twist expression levels,
emphasizing the coupling between EMT and tubulin detyrosination in vivo.
Coordinated elevation of Twist and Glu-tubulin at invasive tumor fronts,
particularly within ductal carcinoma in situ samples, establishes that
EMT-induced tubulin detyrosination occurs at the earliest stages of tumor
invasion. These data support a novel model where the EMT that occurs during tumor
invasion downregulates tubulin tyrosine ligase, increasing a-tubulin
detyrosination and promoting microtentacles that could enhance the reattachment
of circulating tumor cells to the vascular endothelium during metastasis.

PURPOSE: To investigate the prognostic relevance of disseminated tumor cells
(DTCs) in bone marrow (BM) assessed by a multimarker mRNA panel consisting of
TWIST1, cytokeratin 19 (CK19) and human mammaglobin A (hMAM) mRNA, in patients
with early breast cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: TWIST1 (gene name: TWIST1), CK19 (gene name: KRT19), and
hMAM (gene name: SCGB2A2) mRNA was quantitated in BM samples from 191 operable
breast cancer patients by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR).
RESULTS: Using the highest relative mRNA concentration of TWIST1 in the control
population as a cut-off, 5 of the 191 breast cancer patients showed elevated
TWIST1 mRNA levels in their BM by real-time RT-PCR. Two of these patients
experienced a systemic relapse during a median follow-up of 98 months. Combining 
these results with previous hMAM and CK19 mRNA quantifications in the same BM
samples, 12 (40%) of the 30 patients with BM positive for at least 1 marker
(multimarker positive) experienced a systemic relapse as compared with 18 (11%)
of the 161 patients with multimarker-negative BMs. The patients with
multimarker-positive BM had significantly shorter systemic recurrence-free
survival (P < .001, log-rank test), breast cancer-specific survival (P < .001),
and overall survival (P = .03). The prognostic relevance of BM multimarker
detection appeared to be independent of adjuvant treatment, although the
difference was not statistically significant in the subgroup of patients who
received adjuvant chemotherapy. Multivariate analysis demonstrated the BM
multimarker panel status to be a strong independent predictor of clinical
outcome.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated the prognostic relevance of BM DTCs assessed
by a multimarker mRNA panel consisting of TWIST1, CK19, and hMAM in operable
breast cancer patients.

The sole overexpression of pivotal regulators of the embryonic
Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) genetic program ("EMT status") may be
sufficient to efficiently drive the ontogeny of the breast cancer stem cell
molecular signature independently of changes in EMT functioning ("EMT
phenotype"). Using basal-like breast cancer models naturally enriched in either
CD44(pos)CD24(low/neg) or CD44(pos)CD24(pos) tumor-initiating cell populations we
herein illustrate that non-cytotoxic concentrations of the anti-diabetic drug
metformin efficiently impedes the ontogeny of generating the stem cell phenotype 
by transcriptionally repressing the stem cell property EMT. Metformin treatment
dynamically regulated the CD44(pos)CD24(neg/low) breast cancer stem cell
immunophenotype, transcriptionally reprogrammed cells through decreased
expression of key drivers of the EMT machinery including the transcription
factors ZEB1, TWIST1 and SNAI2 (Slug) and the pleiotrophic cytokines TGFßs, and
lastly impeded the propensity of breast cancer stem cells to form multicellular
"microtumors" in non-adherent and non-differentiating conditions (i.e.,
"mammospheres"). These findings, altogether, provide strong motivation for the
continued molecular understanding and clinical development of metformin as a
non-toxic therapeutic aimed to interdict the breast cancer stem cell phenotype by
targeting EMT, a molecular process that is central to the ontogenesis of the
breast cancer stem cell molecular signature.

Tumorigenesis: Twist1 links EMT to self-renewal.

Martin A, Cano A.

Comment on
    Nat Cell Biol. 2010 Oct;12(10):982-92.

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs in pre-metastatic cancer cells
and is also associated with the acquisition of stem-cell-like characteristics. A 
molecular link between EMT and stemness now emerges with the finding that Bmi1, a
polycomb protein that promotes self-renewal of certain stem-cell populations, is 
a direct transcriptional target of the EMT inducer, Twist1.

factor-1a translational pathway in colorectal cancer cells.

Deep vein thrombosis associated with advanced cancer is known as Trousseau's
syndrome. We hypothesized that thrombin, an activator of protease-activated
receptor (PAR)-1 and PAR-4 contributes to tumor metastasis. In this study, we
demonstrated that thrombin and the PAR-1 activating peptide (AP) SFLLRN, but not 
the PAR-4 AP GYPGKF, induced HIF-1a activities, protein expression, and cell
motility in colorectal cancer cells, and these actions were significantly
inhibited by the PAR-1 antagonist SCH79797. Moreover, thrombin-induced HIF-1a
activity and cell motility were blocked by inhibiting important mediators of
signaling transduction, including the ERK, PI3K, and mTOR pathways. These results
showed that thrombin induced HIF-1a protein expression through PAR-1 and HIF-1a
translational de novo protein synthesis. Twist can regulate
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increase tumor metastasis. However,
we observed that thrombin-induced HIF-1a increased Twist mRNA and its protein
level was mediated by the modulation of PAR-1 activation and the HIF-1a
translational pathway. In addition, Twist could increase N-cadherin but not
E-cadherin to promote tumor metastasis. Overexpression of dominant-negative
HIF-1a reversed thrombin-mediated Twist and Twist-induced N-cadherin expression. 
Moreover, siTwist inhibited Twist-induced N-cadherin and Thrombin-induced cell
motility. In conclusion, our study showed that thrombin-induced HIF-1a
upregulated Twist at the transcriptional level to enhance cell motility. These
findings show that thrombin upregulates Twist via HIF-1a to make tumor cells
malignant and also establish a link between the coagulation disorder and cancer
metastasis.

Hyaluronan-CD44 interaction promotes c-Src-mediated twist signaling, microRNA-10b
expression, and RhoA/RhoC up-regulation, leading to Rho-kinase-associated
cytoskeleton activation and breast tumor cell invasion.

Dysregulation of microRNAs is observed in many cancers, including breast cancer. 
In particular, miR-10b appears to play an important role in tumor cell invasion
and breast cancer progression. In this study, we investigated hyaluronan
(HA)-induced CD44 (a primary HA receptor) interaction with c-Src kinase and the
transcriptional factor, Twist, in breast tumor cells (MDA-MB-231 cells). Our
results indicate that HA binding to CD44 promotes c-Src kinase activation, which,
in turn, increases Twist phosphorylation, leading to the nuclear translocation of
Twist and transcriptional activation. Further analyses reveal that miR-10b is
controlled by an upstream promoter containing the Twist binding site(s), whereas 
ChIP assays demonstrate that stimulation of miR-10b expression by
HA/CD44-activated c-Src is Twist-dependent in breast tumor cells. This process
results in the reduction of a tumor suppressor protein (HOXD10), RhoA/RhoC
up-regulation, Rho-kinase (ROK) activation, and breast tumor cell invasion.
Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with PP2 (a c-Src inhibitor) or Twist-specific
siRNAs effectively blocks HA-mediated Twist signaling events, abrogates miR-10b
production, and increases HOXD10 expression. Subsequently, this c-Src/Twist
signaling inhibition causes down-regulation of RhoA/RhoC expression and
impairment of ROK-regulated cytoskeleton function (e.g. tumor cell invasion). To 
further evaluate the role of miR-10b in RhoGTPase signaling, MDA-MB-231 cells
were also transfected with a specific anti-miR-10b inhibitor in order to silence 
miR-10b expression and block its target functions. Our results demonstrate that
anti-miR-10b inhibitor not only enhances HOXD10 expression but also abrogates
HA/CD44-mediated tumor cell behaviors in breast tumor cells. Taken together,
these findings indicate that the HA-induced CD44 interaction with c-Src-activated
Twist plays a pivotal role in miR-10b production, leading to the down-regulation 
of tumor suppressor protein (HOXD10), RhoGTPase-ROK activation, and tumor cell
invasion. All of these events are critical prerequisite steps for the acquisition
of metastatic properties by human breast cancer cells.

Suppression of Her2/neu expression through ILK inhibition is regulated by a
pathway involving TWIST and YB-1.

In a previous study it was found that the therapeutic effects of QLT0267, a small
molecule inhibitor of integrin-linked kinase (ILK), were influenced by Her2/neu
expression. To understand how inhibition or silencing of ILK influences Her2/neu 
expression, Her2/neu signaling was evaluated in six Her2/neu-positive breast
cancer cell lines (LCC6(Her2), MCF7(Her2), SKBR3, BT474, JIMT-1 and KPL-4).
Treatment with QLT0267 engendered suppression (32-87%) of total Her2/neu protein 
in these cells. Suppression of Her2/neu was also observed following small
interfering RNA-mediated silencing of ILK expression. Time course studies suggest
that ILK inhibition or silencing caused transient decreases in P-AKT(ser473),
which were not temporally related to Her2/neu downregulation. Attenuation of ILK 
activity or expression was, however, associated with decreases in YB-1 (Y-box
binding protein-1) protein and transcript levels. YB-1 is a known transcriptional
regulator of Her2/neu expression, and in this study it is demonstrated that
inhibition of ILK activity using QLT0267 decreased YB-1 promoter activity by
50.6%. ILK inhibition was associated with changes in YB-1 localization, as
reflected by localization of cytoplasmic YB-1 into stress granules. ILK
inhibition also suppressed TWIST (a regulator of YB-1 expression) protein
expression. To confirm the role of ILK on YB-1 and TWIST, cells were engineered
to overexpress ILK. This was associated with a fourfold increase in the level of 
YB-1 in the nucleus, and a 2- and 1.5-fold increase in TWIST and Her2/neu protein
levels, respectively. Taken together, these data indicate that ILK regulates the 
expression of Her2/neu through TWIST and YB-1, lending support to the use of ILK 
inhibitors in the treatment of aggressive Her2/neu-positive tumors.

Preaxial polydactyly: interactions among ETV, TWIST1 and HAND2 control
anterior-posterior patterning of the limb.

Preaxial polydactyly (PPD) is a common limb-associated birth defect characterized
by extra digit(s) in the anterior autopod. It often results from ectopic sonic
hedgehog (Shh) expression in the anterior limb bud. Although several
transcription factors are known to restrict Shh expression to the posterior limb 
bud, how they function together remains unclear. Here we provide evidence from
mouse conditional knockout limb buds that the bHLH family transcription factor
gene Twist1 is required to inhibit Shh expression in the anterior limb bud
mesenchyme. More importantly, we uncovered genetic synergism between Twist1 and
the ETS family transcription factor genes Etv4 and Etv5 (collectively Etv), which
also inhibit Shh expression. Biochemical data suggest that this genetic
interaction is a result of direct association between TWIST1 and ETV proteins.
Previous studies have shown that TWIST1 functions by forming homodimers or
heterodimers with other bHLH factors including HAND2, a key positive regulator of
Shh expression. We found that the PPD phenotype observed in Etv mutants is
suppressed by a mutation in Hand2, indicative of genetic antagonism. Furthermore,
overexpression of ETV proteins influences the dimerization of these bHLH factors.
Together, our data suggest that through biochemical interactions, the Shh
expression regulators ETV, TWIST1 and HAND2 attain a precise balance to establish
anterior-posterior patterning of the limb.

PURPOSE: We investigated the mechanism and clinical significance of the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-induced chemoresistance in head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The correlation between the expression of different EMT
regulators and chemoresistance genes, such as excision repair cross
complementation group 1 (ERCC1), was evaluated in cancer cell lines from the
NCI-60 database and four human HNSCC cell lines. Ectopic expression of Snail or
short-interference RNA-mediated repression of Snail or ERCC1 was done in HNSCC
cell lines. Cell viability was examined for cells after cisplatin treatment. A
luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation were used to identify
the transcriptional regulation of ERCC1 by Snail. Immunohistochemical analysis of
Snail, Twist1, ERCC1, hypoxia inducible factor-1 a (HIF-1a), and NBS1 were done
in samples from 72 HNSCC patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
RESULTS: The correlation between the expression of Snail and ERCC1 was confirmed 
in different cell lines, including HNSCC cells. In HNSCC cell lines,
overexpression of Snail in the low endogenous Snail/ERCC1 cell lines FaDu or
CAL-27 increased ERCC1 expression, and hypoxia or overexpression of NBS1 also
upregulated ERCC1. Knockdown of Snail in the high endogenous Snail/ERCC1 cell
line OECM-1 downregulated ERCC1 expression and attenuated cisplatin resistance.
Furthermore, suppression of ERCC1 in Snail- or NBS1-overexpressing HNSCC cells
enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin. Snail directly regulated ERCC1 transcription. 
In patients with HNSCC, coexpression of Snail and ERCC1 correlated with cisplatin
resistance and a poor prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Activation of ERCC1 by Snail is critical in the generation of
cisplatin resistance of HNSCC cells.

    Nat Rev Cancer. 2010 Oct;10(10):666.

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), one of the main mechanisms
underlying development of cancer metastasis, induces stem-like properties in
epithelial cells. Bmi1 is a polycomb-group protein that maintains self-renewal,
and is frequently overexpressed in human cancers. Here, we show the direct
regulation of BMI1 by the EMT regulator, Twist1. Furthermore, Twist1 and Bmi1
were mutually essential to promote EMT and tumour-initiating capability. Twist1
and Bmi1 act cooperatively to repress expression of both E-cadherin and p16INK4a.
In patients with head and neck cancers, increased levels of both Twist1 and Bmi1 
correlated with downregulation of E-cadherin and p16INK4a, and was associated
with the worst prognosis. These results suggest that Twist1-induced EMT and
tumour-initiating capability in cancer cells occurs through chromatin
remodelling, which leads to unfavourable clinical outcomes.

carcinoma.

QingDao University, QingDao, Shan Dong Province, 266403, China.

BACKGROUND: Slug, snail, and twist are transcription factors that regulate the
expression of tumor suppressors such as E-cadherin. In this study, we aimed to
examine the expression of these transcription factors in human bladder carcinoma.
METHODS: We first investigated expression of slug, snail, twist and E-cadherin in
five bladder Carcinoma cell lines by reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction and western blotting. Furthermore, we investigated slug, snail, and
twist and E-cadherin expression by immunohistochemistry with bladder carcinoma
(tumor, n = 120; background, n = 42).
RESULTS: Expression of slug mRNA and protein was detected in all cell lines,
twist was clearly expressed in two out of five bladder carcinoma cell lines,
snail was not expressed, and E-cadherin was detected in 3 cell lines. 44.2%
(53/120) of human bladder carcinoma tissues and 38% (16/42) background tissue
showed an expression of twist; 62.5% (75/120) of human bladder carcinoma tissues 
and 40% (17/42) background tissue showed an expression of slug, 15.8% (19/120) of
human bladder carcinoma tissues and 76% (32/42) background tissue showed an
expression of snail, and 25.8% (31/120) cases were negative for E-cadherin
expression in carcinoma tissues. Expression of slug and twist shows increased
levels in tumors, whereas snail seems reduced. Statistically significant
correlations were found between twist, slug, and E-cadherin expression.
Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that twist was elevated with increasing
tumor stage (P = 0.001), the grade (P < 0.001), the progression (P = 0.035). Slug
was elevated and snail was reduced with increasing nodal involvement
(tumor-node-metastasis status) (P = 0.004, P = 0.01). E-cadherin was reduced in
expression corresponding with tumor grade (P < 0.01). Positive twist, slug and
E-cadherin expression clearly predicted poorer PFS (P = 0.042, P = 0.014, P =
0.001). In the multivariate analysis, only snail and E-cadherin expression were
independent prognostic factors for OS (P = 0.002, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that twist, snail and slug have inappropriate
expression in bladder carcinoma and that this may play a part in the progression 
of human bladder carcinoma.

hnRNP A2/B1 modulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition in lung cancer cell
lines.

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (hnRNP A2/B1) has been reported to 
be overexpressed in lung cancer and in other cancers such as breast, pancreas,
and liver. However, a mechanism linking hnRNP A2/B1 overexpression and
progression to cancer has not yet been definitively established. To elucidate
this mechanism, we have silenced hnRNPA2/B1 mRNA in non-small-cell lung cancer
cell lines A549, H1703, and H358. These cell lines present different levels of
expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers such as
E-cadherin, fibronectin, and vimentin. Microarray expression analysis was
performed to evaluate the effect of silencing hnRNP A2/B1 in A549 cells. We
identified a list of target genes, affected by silencing of hnRNP A2/B1, that are
involved in regulation of migration, proliferation, survival, and apoptosis.
Silencing hnRNP A2/B1 induced formation of cell clusters and increased
proliferation. In the anchorage-independent assay, silencing hnRNP A2/B1
increased colony formation by 794% in A549 and 174% in H1703 compared with a 25% 
increase in proliferation, in both cell lines, in a two-dimensional proliferation
assay. Silencing hnRNP A2/B1 decreased migration in intermediate cell line A549
and mesenchymal cell line H1703; however, no changes in proliferation were
observed in epithelial cell line H358. Silencing hnRNP A2/B1 in A549 and H1703
cells correlated with an increase of E-cadherin expression and downregulation of 
the E-cadherin inhibitors Twist1 and Snai1. These data suggest that expression of
hnRNP A2/B1 may play a role in EMT, in nonepithelial lung cancer cell lines A549 
and H1703, through the regulation of E-cadherin expression.

Twist1 promotes heart valve cell proliferation and extracellular matrix gene
expression during development in vivo and is expressed in human diseased aortic
valves.

45229, USA.

During embryogenesis the heart valves develop from undifferentiated mesenchymal
endocardial cushions (EC), and activated interstitial cells of adult diseased
valves share characteristics of embryonic valve progenitors. Twist1, a class II
basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, is expressed during early EC 
development and is down-regulated later during valve remodeling. The requirements
for Twist1 down-regulation in the remodeling valves and the consequences of
prolonged Twist1 activity were examined in transgenic mice with persistent
expression of Twist1 in developing and mature valves. Persistent Twist1
expression in the remodeling valves leads to increased valve cell proliferation, 
increased expression of Tbx20, and increased extracellular matrix (ECM) gene
expression, characteristic of early valve progenitors. Among the ECM genes
predominant in the EC, Col2a1 was identified as a direct transcriptional target
of Twist1. Increased Twist1 expression also leads to dysregulation of fibrillar
collagen and periostin expression, as well as enlarged hypercellular valve
leaflets prior to birth. In human diseased aortic valves, increased Twist1
expression and cell proliferation are observed adjacent to nodules of
calcification. Overall, these data implicate Twist1 as a critical regulator of
valve development and suggest that Twist1 influences ECM production and cell
proliferation during disease.

Involvement of NF-<U+03BA>B/miR-448 regulatory feedback loop in chemotherapy-induced
epithelial-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells.

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by chemotherapeutic agents
promotes malignant tumor progression; however, the mechanism underlying the
drug-induced EMT remains unclear. In this study, we reported that miR-448 is the 
most downregulated microRNA following chemotherapy. Suppression of miR-448
correlated with EMT induction in breast cancer in vitro and in vivo. With the use
of chromatin immunoprecipitation-seq analysis, we demonstrated that miR-448
suppression induces EMT by directly targeting special AT-rich sequence-binding
protein-1 (SATB1) mRNA, leading to elevated levels of amphiregulin and thereby,
increasing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated Twist1 expression, as
well as nuclear factor <U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B) activation. On the other hand, we also found
that the adriamycin-activated NF-<U+03BA>B directly binds the promoter of miR-448
suppressing its transcription, suggesting a positive feedback loop between NF-<U+03BA>B 
and miR-448. Furthermore, all patients who received cyclophosphamide (CP),
epirubicin plus taxotere/CP, epirubicin plus 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy showed
miR-448 suppression, an increased SATB1, Twist1 expression and acquisition of
mesenchymal phenotypes. These findings reveal an underlying regulatory pathway,
in which the autoregulation between NF-<U+03BA>B and miR-448 is important for restrain
miR-448 suppression upon chemotherapy and may have a role in the regulation of
chemotherapy-induced EMT. Disruption of the NF-<U+03BA>B-miR-448 feedback loop during
clinical treatment may improve the chemotherapy response of human breast cancers 
in which EMT is a critical component.

Loss-of-function analysis of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription
factor Hand1 indicates critical roles in development. In an effort to generate a 
Hand1 cDNA knock-in reporter mouse, we generated two hypomorphic alleles, which
extend embryonic survival to between embryonic day (E) 10.5 and E12.5. Heart
morphogenesis appears largely normal; however, hypomorphic mice display thin left
ventricular myocardium and reduction in pharyngeal mesoderm. Caudal defects,
large allantois, and thickened yolk sac are observed and consistent with systemic
Hand1 gene deletion. Hand1 mRNA is expressed at 30% of wild-type littermates and 
known Hand1-dependent genes show intermediate expression compared with wild-type 
and Hand1 null mice. Interestingly, putative bHLH partners, Hand2 and Twist1,
show altered expression in both Hand1 null and hypomorphic backgrounds and
intercrossing the Hand1 hypomorphic mice onto the Hand2 systemic null background 
exacerbates the cardiac and lateral mesoderm phenotypes. Together, these data
define a critical threshold of Hand1 expression that is necessary for embryonic
survival.

Twist1 activity thresholds define multiple functions in limb development.

The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist1 is essential for normal
limb development. Twist1(-/-) embryos die at midgestation. However, studies on
early limb buds found that Twist1(-/-) mutant limb mesenchyme has an impaired
response to FGF signaling from the apical ectodermal ridge, which disrupts the
feedback loop between the mesenchyme and AER, and reduces and shifts anteriorly
Shh expression in the zone of polarizing activity. We have combined Twist1 null, 
hypomorph and conditional alleles to generate a Twist1 allelic series that
survives to birth. As Twist1 activity is reduced, limb skeletal defects progress 
from preaxial polydactyly to girdle reduction combined with hypoplasia, aplasia
or mirror symmetry of all limb segments. With reduced Twist1 activity there is
striking and progressive upregulation of ectopic Shh expression in the anterior
of the limb, combined with an anterior shift in the posterior Shh domain, which
is expressed at normal intensity, and loss of the posterior AER. Consequently
limb outgrowth is initially impaired, before an ectopic anterior Shh domain
expands the AER, promoting additional growth and repatterning. Reducing the
dosage of FGF targets of the Etv gene family, which are known repressors of Shh
expression in anterior limb mesenchyme, strongly enhances the anterior skeletal
phenotype. Conversely this and other phenotypes are suppressed by reducing the
dosage of the Twist1 antagonist Hand2. Our data support a model whereby multiple 
Twist1 activity thresholds contribute to early limb bud patterning, and suggest
how particular combinations of skeletal defects result from differing amounts of 
Twist1 activity.

Following diagnosis of premature ovarian failure (POF), few women become pregnant
spontaneously and the only fertility treatment that can be offered is oocyte
donation. With advances in fertility technology, timely preservation of female
fertility in the form of egg freezing is a topical area, and one of which
patients are increasingly aware. Women with a family history of POF may be
especially concerned about future fertility. We describe a case where a
consultation was sought in the POF clinic for this issue.

and the formation of a boundary between osteogenic and non-osteogenic cells.

The Notch pathway is crucial for a wide variety of developmental processes
including the formation of tissue boundaries. That it may function in calvarial
suture development and figure in the pathophysiology of craniosynostosis was
suggested by the demonstration that heterozygous loss of function of JAGGED1 in
humans can cause Alagille syndrome, which has craniosynostosis as a feature. We
used conditional gene targeting to examine the role of Jagged1 in the development
of the skull vault. We demonstrate that Jagged1 is expressed in a layer of
mesoderm-derived sutural cells that lie along the osteogenic-non-osteogenic
boundary. We show that inactivation of Jagged1 in the mesodermal compartment of
the coronal suture, but not in the neural crest compartment, results in
craniosynostosis. Mesodermal inactivation of Jagged1 also results in changes in
the identity of sutural cells prior to overt osteogenic differentiation, as well 
as defects in the boundary between osteogenic and non-osteogenic compartments at 
the coronal suture. These changes, surprisingly, are associated with increased
expression of Notch2 and the Notch effector, Hes1, in the sutural mesenchyme.
They are also associated with an increase in nuclear ß-catenin. In Twist1
mutants, Jagged1 expression in the suture is reduced substantially, suggesting an
epistatic relationship between Twist1 and Jagged1. Consistent with such a
relationship, Twist1-Jagged1 double heterozygotes exhibit a substantial increase 
in the severity of craniosynostosis over individual heterozygotes. Our results
thus suggest that Jagged1 is an effector of Twist1 in coronal suture development.

Twist is inversely associated with claudins in germ cell tumors of the testis.

Väre P(1), Soini Y.

Author information: 
(1)Länsi-Pohja Central Hospital, Kemi, Finland.

We investigated the expression of claudins 1, 3-7 and transcriptional factor
twist in a set of testicular germ cell tumors. The material consisted of 17
seminomas, 13 teratomas, 9 teratocarcinomas, 20 embryonal carcinomas and 9 mixed 
germ cell tumors. They were immunostained with antibodies to claudins 1, 3-7 and 
twist. As expected, all claudins were variably present in germ cell tumors with
epithelial elements or differentiation, but the intensity of expression varied
depending on the claudin type. Mesenchymal elements in teratomatous tumors
remained negative for claudins. Expression of different claudins was less intense
and inconsistent in other types of germ cell tumors. Choriocarcinomatous elements
in germ cell tumors expressed relatively strongly claudin 4 and weaker positivity
for claudins 5-7, while claudins 1 and 3 were negative. Seminomas showed
expression only for claudins 5 and 7. The transcriptional factor twist was most
strongly expressed in seminoma followed by embryonal carcinoma. Twist expression 
was inversely associated with several claudins (claudins 1, 3, 4 and 6). Germ
cell tumors vary in their expression of claudins 1-7. Twist expression was
inversely associated with several claudins, suggesting that it takes part in the 
downregulation of claudins in testicular tumors.

metastasis of human ovarian cancer cells.

The acquisition of invasiveness in ovarian cancer (OC) is accompanied by the
process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The MUC4 mucin is
overexpressed in ovarian tumors and has a role in the invasiveness of OC cells.
The present study was aimed at evaluating the potential involvement of MUC4 in
the metastasis of OC cells by inducing EMT. Ectopic overexpression of MUC4 in OC 
cells (SKOV3-MUC4) resulted in morphological alterations along with a decreased
expression of epithelial markers (E-cadherin and cytokeratin (CK)-18) and an
increased expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin and vimentin) compared
with the control cells (SKOV3-vector). Also, pro-EMT transcription factors
TWIST1, TWIST2 and SNAIL showed an upregulation in SKOV3-MUC4 cells. We further
investigated the pathways upstream of N-cadherin, such as focal adhesion kinase
(FAK), MKK7, JNK1/2 and c-Jun, which were also activated in the SKOV3-MUC4 cells 
compared with SKOV3-vector cells. Inhibition of phospho-FAK (pFAK) and pJNK1/2
decreased N-cadherin expression in the MUC4-overexpressing cells, which further
led to a significant decrease in cellular motility. Knockdown of N-cadherin
decreased the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2),
AKT and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), and inhibited the motility in the
SKOV3-MUC4 cells. Upon in vivo tumorigenesis and metastasis analysis, the
SKOV3-MUC4 cells produced significantly larger tumors and demonstrated a higher
incidence of metastasis to distance organs (peritoneal wall, colon, intestine,
stomach, lymph nodes, liver and diaphragm). Taken together, our study reveals a
novel role for MUC4 in inducing EMT through the upregulation of N-cadherin and
promoting metastasis of OC cells.

Pivotal role of Twist in skeletal biology and pathology.

Miraoui H(1), Marie PJ.

France.

Basic Helix-loop-Helix (bHLH) factors play important roles in development and
disease. Recent functional and genetic analyses revealed that the bHLH factor
Twist1 is a critical modulator of mesenchymal cell fate during skeletal
development. Specifically, studies in mice and humans showed that Twist1 controls
mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into chondrocytes, osteoblasts or
adipocytes via direct and indirect mechanisms. In a physiological context, Twist1
targets several molecular mechanisms to induce positive or negative effects on
osteoblastic cell growth, differentiation and survival. In a pathological
context, Twist1 loss-of-function mutations induce premature cranial suture fusion
(craniosynostosis) in the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. In this syndrome, expansion
of cranial osteogenesis at the suture level results from alterations in the
balance between osteoprogenitor cell proliferation, differentiation and
apoptosis. These studies provide mechanisms by which Twist1 plays a pivotal role 
in skeletal cell fate in normal and pathologic conditions, which may offer
therapeutic perspectives in conditions where mesenchymal cell behaviour is
compromised.

The focal facial dermal dysplasias (FFDDs) are a group of inherited developmental
disorders in which the characteristic diagnostic feature is bitemporal scar-like 
lesions that resemble forceps marks. To date, the genetic defects underlying
these ectodermal dysplasias have not been determined. To identify the gene defect
causing autosomal-recessive Setleis syndrome (type III FFDD), homozygosity
mapping was performed with genomic DNAs from five affected individuals and 26
members of the consanguineous Puerto Rican (PR) family originally described by
Setleis and colleagues. Microsatellites D2S1397 and D2S2968 were homozygous in
all affected individuals, mapping the disease locus to 2q37.3. Haplotype analyses
of additional markers in the PR family and a consanguineous Arab family further
limited the disease locus to approximately 3 Mb between D2S2949 and D2S2253. Of
the 29 candidate genes in this region, the bHLH transcription factor, TWIST2, was
initially sequenced on the basis of its known involvement in murine facial
development. Homozygous TWIST2 nonsense mutations, c.324C>T and c.486C>T, were
identified in the affected members of the Arab and PR families, respectively.
Characterization of the expressed mutant proteins, p.Q65X and p.Q119X, by
electrophoretic mobility shift assays and immunoblot analyses indicated that they
were truncated and unstable. Notably, Setleis syndrome patients and Twist2
knockout mice have similar facial features, indicating the gene's conserved role 
in mammalian development. Although human TWIST2 and TWIST1 encode highly
homologous bHLH transcription factors, the finding that TWIST2 recessive
mutations cause an FFDD and dominant TWIST1 mutations cause Saethre-Chotzen
craniocynostosis suggests that they function independently in skin and bone
development.

A mutation within one allele of the p53 tumor suppressor gene can inactivate the 
remaining wild-type allele in a dominant-negative manner and in some cases can
exert an additional oncogenic activity, known as mutant p53 'gain of function'
(GOF). To study the role of p53 mutations in prostate cancer and to discriminate 
between the dominant-negative effect and the GOF activity of mutant p53, we
measured, using microarrays, the expression profiles of three immortalized
prostate epithelial cultures expressing wild-type, inactivated p53 or mutated
p53. Analysis of these gene expression profiles showed that both inactivated p53 
and p53(R175H) mutant expression resulted in the upregulation of cell cycle
progression genes. A second group, which was upregulated exclusively by mutant
p53(R175H), was predominantly enriched in developmental genes. This group of
genes included the Twist1, a regulator of metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT). Twist1 levels were also elevated in metastatic prostate
cancer-derived cell line DU145, in immortalized lung fibroblasts and in a subset 
of lung cancer samples, all in a mutant p53-dependent manner. p53(R175H) mutant
bearing immortalized epithelial cells showed typical features of EMT, such as
higher expression of mesenchymal markers, lower expression of epithelial markers 
and enhanced invasive properties in vitro. The mechanism by which p53(R175H)
mutant induces Twist1 expression involves alleviation of the epigenetic
repression. Our data suggest that Twist1 expression might be upregulated
following p53 mutation in cancer cells.

Copy number variation analysis in single-suture craniosynostosis: multiple rare
variants including RUNX2 duplication in two cousins with metopic
craniosynostosis.

Little is known about genes that underlie isolated single-suture
craniosynostosis. In this study, we hypothesize that rare copy number variants
(CNV) in patients with isolated single-suture craniosynostosis contain genes
important for cranial development. Using whole genome array comparative genomic
hybridization (CGH), we evaluated DNA from 186 individuals with single-suture
craniosynostosis for submicroscopic deletions and duplications. We identified a
1.1 Mb duplication encompassing RUNX2 in two affected cousins with metopic
synostosis and hypodontia. Given that RUNX2 is required as a master switch for
osteoblast differentiation and interacts with TWIST1, mutations in which also
cause craniosynostosis, we conclude that the duplication in this family is
pathogenic, albeit with reduced penetrance. In addition, we find that a total of 
7.5% of individuals with single-suture synostosis in our series have at least one
rare deletion or duplication that contains genes and that has not been previously
reported in unaffected individuals. The genes within and disrupted by CNVs in
this cohort are potential novel candidate genes for craniosynostosis.

Aberrant promoter hypermethylation and genomic hypomethylation in tumor, adjacent
normal tissues and blood from breast cancer patients.

Columbia University, 630 West 168 St. New York, NY 10032, USA.

BACKGROUND: Promoter hypermethylation and global hypomethylation in the human
genome are hallmarks of most cancers. Detection of aberrant methylation in white 
blood cells (WBC) has been suggested as a marker for cancer development, but has 
not been extensively investigated. This study was carried out to determine
whether aberrant methylation in WBC DNA can be used as a surrogate biomarker for 
breast cancer risk.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Promoter hypermethylation of 8 tumor suppressor genes
(RASSF1A, APC, HIN1, BRCA1, CYCLIND2, RARbeta, CDH1 and TWIST1) and DNA
methylation for three repetitive elements (LINE1, Sat2 and Alu) were analyzed in 
invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, paired adjacent normal tissue and WBC
from 40 breast cancer patients by the MethyLight assay. Methylation in WBC from
40 controls was also analyzed.
RESULTS: Tumor and adjacent tissues showed frequent hypermethylation for all
genes tested, while WBC DNA was rarely hypermethylated. For HIN1, RASSF1A, APC
and TWIST1, there was agreement between hypermethylation in tumor and adjacent
tissues (p=0.04, p=0.02, p=0.005 and p<0.0001, respectively). DNA methylation for
the three repetitive elements was lower in tumor compared to adjacent tissue and 
WBC DNA. Significant correlations in the methylation of Sat2M1 between tumor and 
adjacent tissues and WBC DNA were found (p<0.0001 and p=0.046, respectively).
There was also a significant difference in methylation of Sat2M1 between cases
and controls (p=0.01).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that further studies of WBC methylation,
including prospective studies, may provide biomarkers of breast cancer risk.

Metastasis in an orthotopic murine model of melanoma is independent of RAS/RAF

Melanoma is the most lethal skin tumor in large part because of a propensity for 
early metastasis. Good models of this most clinically relevant feature of
melanoma are lacking. Here, we report the development of an in-vivo model of
metastasis that relies on orthotopic injection of green fluorescent
protein-tagged lines in immunodeficient mice, serial intravital imaging of tumor 
progression, and quantification of distant spread by two-photon laser scanning
microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and real-time PCR analysis. Using this system, 
we report an assessment of the in-vivo growth and metastatic properties of 11
well-characterized human melanoma cell lines. A subset of lines showed rapid
in-vivo growth with invasion of host vasculature and distant seeding of viscera
in this system. The ability to form metastasis in vivo did not correlate with
three-dimensional collagen invasion in vitro. Surprisingly, similar lines in
terms of molecular genetic events differed markedly in their propensity to
metastasize to distant organs such as brain and lung. In particular, two lines
harboring B-RAF mutation and high levels of phosphorylated ERK and AKT were
reproducibly unable to form tumors after orthotopic injection. Similarly, two
previously identified RAS/RAF wildtype 'epithelial like' lines that do not have
elevated phosphorylated ERK and AKT or express TWIST1 mRNA still showed a
pronounced ability for orthotopic growth and metastatic spread. All the
metastatic cell lines in this model showed increased NEDD9 expression, but NEDD9 
lentiviral overexpression did not convey a metastatic phenotype on nonmetastatic 
cells. These data suggest that melanoma metastasis is a molecularly heterogeneous
process that may not require epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition or ERK
activation, although both may facilitate the process.

OBJECTIVE: This study examined differential gene expression, histomorphometric
indices and relationships between these, in femoral trabecular bone from
osteoarthritis (OA) patients and control (CTL) subjects, with the aim of
identifying potential molecular drivers consistent with changes in structural and
remodelling indices in the OA pathology.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone samples from the intertrochanteric (IT) region were
obtained from age and sex-matched cohorts of 23 primary hip OA patients and 21
CTL subjects. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and histomorphometric
analysis were performed on each sample and correlations between gene expression
and histomorphometric variables determined.
RESULTS: Alterations in gene expression, structural indices and correlations
between these were found in OA bone compared to CTL. In OA bone, expression of
critical regulators of osteoblast differentiation (TWIST1) and function (PTEN,
TIMP4) were decreased, while genes associated with inflammation (SMAD3, CD14)
were increased. Bone structural and formation indices (BV/TV, Tb.N, OS/BS) were
increased, whereas resorption indices (ES/BS, ES/BV) were decreased. Importantly,
significant correlations in CTL bone between CTNNB1 expression and formation
indices (OS/BS, OS/BV, OV/BV) were absent in OA bone, indicating altered
WNT/ß-catenin signalling. TWIST1 expression and BV/TV were correlated in CTL
bone, but not in OA bone, consistent with altered osteoblastogenesis in OA.
Matrix metalloproteinase 25 (MMP25) expression and remodelling indices (ES/BS,
ES/BV, ES/TV) were correlated only in OA pointing to aberrant bone remodelling in
this pathology.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate an altered state of osteoblast
differentiation and function in OA driven by several key molecular regulators. In
association with this differential gene expression, an altered state of both
trabecular bone remodelling and resulting microarchitecture were also observed,
further characterising the pathogenesis of primary hip OA.

TWIST1 promotes invasion through mesenchymal change in human glioblastoma.

BACKGROUND: Tumor cell invasion into adjacent normal brain is a mesenchymal
feature of GBM and a major factor contributing to their dismal outcomes.
Therefore, better understandings of mechanisms that promote mesenchymal change in
GBM are of great clinical importance to address invasion. We previously showed
that the bHLH transcription factor TWIST1 which orchestrates carcinoma metastasis
through an epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is upregulated in GBM and
promotes invasion of the SF767 GBM cell line in vitro.
RESULTS: To further define TWIST1 functions in GBM we tested the impact of TWIST1
over-expression on invasion in vivo and its impact on gene expression. We found
that TWIST1 significantly increased SNB19 and T98G cell line invasion in
orthotopic xenotransplants and increased expression of genes in functional
categories associated with adhesion, extracellular matrix proteins, cell motility
and locomotion, cell migration and actin cytoskeleton organization. Consistent
with this TWIST1 reduced cell aggregation, promoted actin cytoskeletal
re-organization and enhanced migration and adhesion to fibronectin substrates.
Individual genes upregulated by TWIST1 known to promote EMT and/or GBM invasion
included SNAI2, MMP2, HGF, FAP and FN1. Distinct from carcinoma EMT, TWIST1 did
not generate an E- to N-cadherin "switch" in GBM cell lines. The clinical
relevance of putative TWIST target genes SNAI2 and fibroblast activation protein 
alpha (FAP) identified in vitro was confirmed by their highly correlated
expression with TWIST1 in 39 human tumors. The potential therapeutic importance
of inhibiting TWIST1 was also shown through a decrease in cell invasion in vitro 
and growth of GBM stem cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Together these studies demonstrated that TWIST1 enhances GBM
invasion in concert with mesenchymal change not involving the canonical cadherin 
switch of carcinoma EMT. Given the recent recognition that mesenchymal change in 
GBMs is associated with increased malignancy, these findings support the
potential therapeutic importance of strategies to subvert TWIST1-mediated
mesenchymal change.

Delayed osteoprogenitor differentiation in cleft-palate models.

Pungchanchaikul P(1), Bloch-Zupan A, Ferretti P.

Author information: 
(1)UCL Institute of Child Health, London, UK.

Failure of palatal shelf fusion results in cleft palate (CP) and may lead to
malformation of palatal bones and undergrowth of the maxilla. It is not known
whether defects in bone formation may contribute to this phenotype. We tested the
hypothesis that impaired fusion of developing palatal shelves affects palatal
bone development using palate organotypic cultures. Using two different
approaches, we show that induction of cleft results in increased expression of
pre-osteoblast and early osteoblast markers, Twist1, Snai1 and Runx2, and
decreased expression of more mature markers of bone differentiation, collagen-1
and osteopontin, indicating delayed osteoblast differentiation in CPs. This,
together with the increase in immature osteoblasts and proliferation observed in 
non-fused palatal shelves, suggests that palatal osteoblast differentiation is at
least partly modulated by shelf fusion. Delayed osteoblast differentiation may
therefore contribute to defects in gross morphology and function of the maxilla
in CP patients.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, and despite significant
advances in diagnosing and treating it, metastatic spread of cancer cells results
in a high mortality rate. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an
embryonic program in which epithelial cells lose their characteristics and gain
mesenchymal features. Therefore, EMT might play a very important role during
malignant tumour progression. In this review we summarise recent advances in
breast cancer research with a particular focus on the transcription factors
Snail1 and Twist1. Besides discussing the role of EMT in normal mammary gland
development, we describe regulatory mechanisms involving newly discovered
upstream regulators and microRNAs, the association of EMT with breast cancer stem
cells, and the involvement of the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer
progression.

Gli3 is a zinc-finger transcription factor whose activity is dependent on the
level of hedgehog (Hh) ligand. Hh signaling has key roles during endochondral
ossification; however, its role in intramembranous ossification is still unclear.
In this study, we show that Gli3 performs a dual role in regulating both
osteoprogenitor proliferation and osteoblast differentiation during
intramembranous ossification. We discovered that Gli3Xt-J/Xt-J mice, which
represent a Gli3-null allele, exhibit craniosynostosis of the lambdoid sutures
and that this is accompanied by increased osteoprogenitor proliferation and
differentiation. These cellular changes are preceded by ectopic expression of the
Hh receptor Patched1 and reduced expression of the transcription factor Twist1 in
the sutural mesenchyme. Twist1 is known to delay osteogenesis by binding to and
inhibiting the transcription factor Runx2. We found that Runx2 expression in the 
lambdoid suture was altered in a pattern complimentary to that of Twist1. We
therefore propose that loss of Gli3 results in a Twist1-, Runx2-dependent
expansion of the sutural osteoprogenitor population as well as enhanced
osteoblastic differentiation which results in a bony bridge forming between the
parietal and interparietal bones. We show that FGF2 will induce Twist1, normalize
osteoprogenitor proliferation and differentiation and rescue the lambdoid suture 
synostosis in Gli3Xt-J/Xt-J mice. Taken together, we define a novel role for Gli3
in osteoblast development; we describe the first mouse model of lambdoid suture
craniosynostosis and show how craniosynostosis can be rescued in this model.

Molecular silencing of Twist1 enhances osteogenic differentiation of murine
mesenchymal stem cells: implication of FGFR2 signaling.

Diderot, Hôpital Lariboisiere, Paris, France.

The capacity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to differentiate into functional
osteoblasts is tightly controlled by transcription factors that trigger
osteoblast commitment and differentiation. The role of Twist1, a basic
helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, in osteogenic differentiation of
MSCs remains unclear. Here we investigated the role of Twist1 in the osteogenic
differentiation program of murine C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cells. We showed that
molecular silencing of Twist1 using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression
moderately increased C3H10T1/2 cell proliferation and had no effect on cell
survival. In contrast, Twist1 silencing enhanced osteoblast gene expression and
matrix mineralization in vitro. Biochemical analyses revealed that Twist1
silencing increased the expression of FGFR2 protein level, which was reduced by a
mutant Runx2. Consistent with this finding, Twist1 silencing increased ERK1/2 and
PI3K signaling. Moreover, molecular or pharmacological inhibition of FGFR2 or of 
ERK1/2 and PI3K signaling partly abolished the increased osteoblast gene
expression induced by Twist1 silencing in C3H10T1/2 cells. These results reveal
that Twist1 silencing upregulates osteoblast differentiation of murine
mesenchymal cells in part via activation of FGFR2 expression and downstream
signaling pathways, which provides novel insights into the molecular signals by
which this transcription factor regulates the osteogenic differentiation program 
in MSCs.

Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, 3002, Australia.

Phyllodes tumours and cellular fibroadenomas are both fibroepithelial tumours of 
the breast. Phyllodes tumours, unlike fibroadenomas, have the ability to recur
and metastasise. Although these lesions can be distinguished by their stromal
cellularity, mitotic index, presence or absence of stromal overgrowth and
cellular atypia, there is overlap and not infrequently a definitive diagnosis
cannot be made, particularly on biopsy. We sought to evaluate whether DNA
promoter methylation profiling using selected genes known to be methylated in
cancer would allow us to learn more about the biology of these tumours, and
whether it could identify methylation markers that could differentiate phyllodes 
tumours from fibroadenomas and/or distinguish phyllodes tumours of different
grades. Methylation-sensitive high resolution melting (MS-HRM) was used to screen
promoter DNA methylation changes in 86 phyllodes tumours (15 benign, 28
borderline, 43 malignant) and 26 fibroadenomas. A panel of 11 genes (RASSF1A,
TWIST1, APC, WIF1, MGMT, MAL, RARß, CDKN2A, CDH1, TP73 and MLH1) was tested.
Methylation status was correlated with histology and with clinicopathological
parameters. Five of the gene promoters showed some methylation in a proportion of
phyllodes tumours; RASSF1A, 45.3%; TWIST1, 10.7%; APC, 4.1%; WIF1, 2.9% and MGMT,
1.3%. Only two genes showed any methylation in fibroadenomas usually at
background levels; RASSF1A, 53.8% and MGMT, 8.3%. No CDKN2A methylation was
observed in either tumour type, contrary to previous reports. Overall, the
methylation patterns differed little from that which might be seen in normal
cells. However, significant levels of methylation of RASSF1A (24.4%) and TWIST1
(7.1%) was observed in some phyllodes tumours. Elevated RASSF1A and/or TWIST1
methylation was significantly associated with phyllodes tumours compared with
fibroadenomas (P = 0.02), TWIST1 methylation correlated with increasing
malignancy in phyllodes tumours (P < 0.001). In conclusion, assessment of
methylation of RASSF1A and TWIST1 may aid in the diagnosis of phyllodes tumours. 
The absence of frequent methylation in fibroadenomas supports a non-neoplastic
origin.

The helix-loop-helix transcription factor TWIST is dysregulated in
myelodysplastic syndromes.

Author information: 
(1)Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle,
WA, USA.

Patients with low-grade myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) show high levels of tumor
necrosis factor a (TNFa) and up-regulation of apoptosis in the marrow. In
contrast, marrow cells in advanced MDS are typically resistant to TNFa-induced
apoptosis but are rendered apoptosis-sensitive on coculture with stroma. The
present studies show that CD34(+) marrow cells in advanced MDS express high
levels of TWIST, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that opposes p53
function. TWIST levels correlated with disease stage (advanced > low grade; P =
.01). Coculture with HS5 stroma resulted in down-regulation of TWIST and
increased apoptosis in response to TNFa in CD34(+) cells from advanced MDS; the
same effect was achieved by TWIST-specific RNA interference in CD34(+) cells. In 
primary MDS marrow stroma TWIST expression was lower than in healthy controls;
suppression of TWIST in stroma interfered with induction of apoptosis sensitivity
in cocultured CD34(+) cells. Stroma cells so modified expressed reduced levels of
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1; CD54); blockade of ICAM1 in unmodified 
stroma was associated with reduced apoptosis in cocultured CD34(+) MDS marrow
cells. These data suggest role for dysregulation of TWIST in the pathophysiology 
of MDS. Conceivably, TWIST or components in the signaling pathway could serve as 
therapeutic targets for patients with MDS.

Differential activation of canonical Wnt signaling determines cranial sutures
fate: a novel mechanism for sagittal suture craniosynostosis.

Premature closure of cranial sutures, which serve as growth centers for the skull
vault, result in craniosynostosis. In the mouse posterior frontal (PF) suture
closes by endochondral ossification, whereas sagittal (SAG) remain patent life
time, although both are neural crest tissue derived. We therefore, investigated
why cranial sutures of same tissue origin adopt a different fate. We demonstrated
that closure of the PF suture is tightly regulated by canonical Wnt signaling,
whereas patency of the SAG suture is achieved by constantly activated canonical
Wnt signaling. Importantly, the fate of PF and SAG sutures can be reversed by
manipulating Wnt signaling. Continuous activation of canonical Wnt signaling in
the PF suture inhibits endochondral ossification and therefore, suture closure,
In contrast, inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling in the SAG suture, upon
treatment with Wnt antagonists results in endochondral ossification and suture
closure. Thus, inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling in the SAG suture
phenocopies craniosynostosis. Moreover, mice haploinsufficient for Twist1, a
target gene of canonical Wnt signaling which inhibits chondrogenesis, have
sagittal craniosynostosis. We propose that regulation of canonical Wnt signaling 
is of crucial importance during the physiological patterning of PF and SAG
sutures. Importantly, dysregulation of this pathway may lead to craniosynostosis.

human non-small cell lung cancer cells.

BACKGROUND: Isothiocyanates are natural compounds found in consumable cruciferous
vegetables. They have been shown to inhibit chemical carcinogenesis by a wide
variety of chemical carcinogens in animal models. Recent studies have also shown 
that isothiocyanates have antitumor activity, inhibiting the growth of several
types of cultured human cancer cells. Our previous study showed that PEITC
inhibited human leukemia cells growth by inducing apoptosis. However, the effect 
of isothiocyanates on lung cancer cell metastasis has not been studied. In the
present study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of BITC and PEITC on
metastatic potential of highly metastatic human lung cancer L9981 cells.
METHODS: Cell migration and invasion were measured by wound healing assay and
transwell chemotaxis assay. Expression of metastasis-related genes was assessed
by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. The mechanisms of action were
evaluated by flow cytometry, reporter assay and Western blotting.
RESULTS: Our data showed that both BITC and PEITC inhibited L9981 cell growth in 
a dose-dependent manner, the IC50 values were 5.0 and 9.7 microM, respectively.
Cell migrations were reduced to 8.1% and 16.5% of control, respectively; and cell
invasions were reduced to 2.7% and 7.3% of control, respectively.
Metastasis-related genes MMP-2, Twist and beta-catenin were also modulated. BITC 
and PEITC inhibited cell survival signaling molecules Akt and NFkappaB
activation. Moreover, BITC and PEITC increased ROS generation and caused GSH
depletion. Pretreatment with NAC blocked BITC and PEITC induced ROS elevation and
NFkappaB inhibition.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that BITC and PEITC suppress lung cancer cell
metastasis potential by modulation of metastasis-related gene expression,
inhibition of Akt/NFkappaB pathway. Induction of oxidative stress may play an
important role.

Continuous elevation of PTH increases the number of osteoblasts via both
osteoclast-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

Sustained parathyroid hormone (PTH) elevation stimulates bone remodeling (ie,
both resorption and formation). The former results from increased RANKL
synthesis, but the cause of the latter has not been established. Current
hypotheses include release of osteoblastogenic factors from osteoclasts or from
the bone matrix during resorption, modulation of the production and activity of
osteoblastogenic factors from cells of the osteoblast lineage, and increased
angiogenesis. To dissect the contribution of these mechanisms, 6-month-old
Swiss-Webster mice were infused for 5 days with 470 ng/h PTH(1-84) or 525 ng/h
soluble RANKL (sRANKL). Both agents increased osteoclasts and osteoblasts in
vertebral cancellous bone, but the ratio of osteoblasts to osteoclasts and the
increase in bone formation was greater in PTH-treated mice. Cancellous bone mass 
was maintained in mice receiving PTH but lost in mice receiving sRANKL,
indicating that maintenance of balanced remodeling requires osteoblastogenic
effects beyond those mediated by osteoclasts. Consistent with this contention,
PTH, but not sRANKL, decreased the level of the Wnt antagonist sclerostin and
increased the expression of the Wnt target genes Nkd2, Wisp1, and Twist1.
Furthermore, PTH, but not sRANKL, increased the number of blood vessels in the
bone marrow. Weekly injections of the RANKL antagonist osteoprotegerin at 10<U+2009>µg/g
for 2 weeks prior to PTH infusion eliminated osteoclasts and osteoblasts and
prevented the PTH-induced increase in osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and blood
vessels. These results indicate that PTH stimulates osteoclast-dependent as well 
as osteoclast-independent (Wnt signaling) pro-osteoblastogenic pathways, both of 
which are required for balanced focal bone remodeling in cancellous bone.

Twist1 has been proposed to have oncogenic properties. Although Twist1 was
reported to interact with p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) and to inhibit the
functions of PCAF, it remains unclear how PCAF affects the functions of Twist1,
cell growth, invasive ability, and cellular sensitivity to anticancer agents. We 
found that PCAF, Twist1, and Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) expressions were
elevated in cisplatin- and doxorubicin-resistant cancer cells. Luciferase
reporter assays revealed that PCAF manipulation modulated YB-1 transcription in a
Twist1-dependent manner. In addition, PCAF regulated the Twist1 intracellular
localization and the Twist1 transcriptional activity through its acetylation
function to the Twist1. Suppression of PCAF expression reduced YB-1 expression in
human urothelial cancer KK47 cells. As a result, the cell growth and invasive
ability of KK47 cells was retarded by PCAF knockdown, and PCAF knockdown rendered
KK47 cells sensitive to cisplatin and doxorubicin, but not to 5-fluorouracil. The
present data suggest that Twist1 and YB-1 as well as PCAF may be promising
molecular therapeutic targets.

Coordinated epigenetic repression of the miR-200 family and miR-205 in invasive
bladder cancer.

MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNAs commonly deregulated in cancer. The
miR-200 family (miR-200a, -200b, -200c, -141 and -429) and miR-205 are frequently
silenced in advanced cancer and have been implicated in epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and tumor invasion by targeting the transcriptional repressors
of E-cadherin, ZEB1 and ZEB2. ZEB1 is also known to repress miR-200c-141
transcription in a negative feedback loop, but otherwise little is known about
the transcriptional regulation of the miR-200 family and miR-205. Recently,
miR-200 silencing was also reported in cancer stem cells, implying that miR-200
deregulation is a key event in multiple levels of tumor biology. However, what
prevents miR-200 expression remains largely unanswered. Here we report concerted 
transcriptional regulation of the miR-200 and miR-205 loci in bladder tumors and 
bladder cell lines. Using a combination of miRNA expression arrays, qPCR assays
and mass spectrometry DNA methylation analyses, we show that the miR-200 and
miR-205 loci are specifically silenced and gain promoter hypermethylation and
repressive chromatin marks in muscle invasive bladder tumors and undifferentiated
bladder cell lines. Moreover, we report that miR-200c expression is significantly
correlated with early stage T1 bladder tumor progression, and propose miR-200 and
miR-205 silencing and DNA hypermethylation as possible prognostic markers in
bladder cancer. In addition, we observe that the mesoderm transcription factor
TWIST1 and miR-200 expression are inversely correlated in bladder tumor samples
and cell lines. TWIST1 associates directly with the miR-200 and miR-205
promoters, and may act as a repressor of miR-200 and miR-205 expression.

OBJECTIVE: We have noted that quantitative multiplex-methylation specific PCR
(QM-MSP) analysis of a key panel of genes may be useful as an ancillary tool for 
ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) detection in breast tissue. In this study, we
investigated aberrant promoter hypermethylation of four genes as a means to
detect epigenetic alterations specific to breast carcinoma in the serum of
patients with DCIS and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC).
METHODS: Two hundred forty-three serum samples from 89 patients with IDC, 30
patients with DCIS, and 125 age-matched healthy controls were examined. After DNA
extraction and sodium bisulfite treatment, QM-MSP was performed for HIN-1,
RASSF1A, RAR-beta, and Twist.
RESULTS: Overall significant differences in methylation levels were observed for 
HIN-1 (p=0.006), RAR-beta (p<0.001), RASSF1A (p=0.004), and Twist (p<0.001). All 
four genes showed significantly higher methylation frequencies in DCIS or IDC
than in control subjects (p<0.001 for all comparisons). However, methylation
frequencies were not significantly different between DCIS and IDC. In
receiver-operating characteristic analysis, the two-gene combination
(RAR-beta/RASSF1A) showed the best performance in distinguishing DCIS/IDC from
control samples. The estimated specificity of this two-gene panel for detecting
DCIS/IDC was 88.8%, and its sensitivity was 94.1%.
CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative detection of aberrant DNA methylation in serum
samples may be a promising high throughput approach for the diagnosis of breast
cancer including DCIS.

Sprouty1 is a critical regulatory switch of mesenchymal stem cell lineage
allocation.

Development of bone and adipose tissue are linked processes arising from a common
progenitor cell, but having an inverse relationship in disease conditions such as
osteoporosis. Cellular differentiation of both tissues relies on growth factor
cues, and we focus this study on Sprouty1 (Spry1), an inhibitor of growth factor 
signaling. We tested whether Spry1 can modify the development of fat cells
through its activity in regulating growth factors known to be important for
adipogenesis. We utilized conditional expression and genetic-null mouse models of
Spry1 in adipocytes using the fatty acid binding promoter (aP2). Conditional
deletion of Spry1 results in 10% increased body fat and decreased bone mass. This
phenotype was rescued on Spry1 expression, which results in decreased body fat
and increased bone mass. Ex vivo bone marrow experiments indicate Spry1 in bone
marrow and adipose progenitor cells favors differentiation of osteoblasts at the 
expense of adipocytes by suppressing CEBP-beta and PPARgamma while up regulating 
TAZ. Age and gender-matched littermates expressing only Cre recombinase were used
as controls. Spry1 is a critical regulator of adipocyte differentiation and
mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) lineage allocation, potentially acting through
regulation of CEBP-beta and TAZ.

PKB/AKT phosphorylation of the transcription factor Twist-1 at Ser42 inhibits p53
activity in response to DNA damage.

Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) is ubiquitously expressed in cells. Phosphorylation of
its multiple targets in response to various stimuli, including growth factors or 
cytokines, promotes cell survival and inhibits apoptosis. PKB is upregulated in
many different cancers and a significant amount of the enzyme is present in its
activated form. Here we show that PKB phosphorylates one of the anti-apoptotic
proteins--transcription factor Twist-1 at Ser42. Cells expressing Twist-1
displayed inefficient p53 upregulation in response to DNA damage induced by
gamma-irradiation or the genotoxic drug adriamycin. This influenced the
activation of p53 target genes such as p21(Waf1) and Bax and led to aberrant
cell-cycle regulation and the inhibition of apoptosis. The impaired induction of 
these p53 effector molecules is likely to be mediated by PKB-dependent
phosphorylation of Twist-1 because, unlike the wild-type mutant, the Twist-1 S42A
mutant did not confer cell resistance to DNA damage. Moreover, phosphorylation of
Twist-1 at Ser42 was shown in vivo in various human cancer tissues, suggesting
that this post-translational modification ensures functional activation of
Twist-1 after promotion of survival during carcinogenesis.

Cancer stem cells are responsible for sustaining the tumor and giving rise to
proliferating and progressively differentiating cells. However, the molecular
mechanisms regulating the process of cancer stem cell (CSC) differentiation is
not clearly understood. Recently, we reported the isolation of the epithelial
ovarian cancer (EOC) stem cells (type I/CD44+). In this study, we show that type 
I/CD44+ cells are characterized by low levels of both miR-199a and miR-214,
whereas mature EOC cells (type II/CD44-) have higher levels of miR-199a and
miR-214. Moreover, these two micro RNAs (miRNAs) are regulated as a cluster on
pri-miR-199a2 within the human Dnm3os gene (GenBank FJ623959). This study
identify Twist1 as a regulator of this unique miRNA cluster responsible for the
regulation of the IKKbeta/NF-kappaB and PTEN/AKT pathways and its association of 
ovarian CSC differentiation. Our data suggest that Twist1 may be an important
regulator of 'stemness' in EOC cells. The regulation of MIR199A2/214 expression
may be used as a potential therapeutic approach in EOC patients.

OBJECTIVE: To screen and compare the specific transcription factors that repress 
the epithelial phenotype in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in two
different human prostate cancer models LNCaP/HIF1alpha and ARCaP.
METHODS: We established two different prostate cancer EMT models, LNCaP/HIF1alpha
and ARCaP, cultured LNCaP, LNCaP/HIF1alpha, IF11 and IA8 cells in vitro, and
detected the five transcription factors Snail, Slug, ZEB1, SIP1 and Twist1 in
these cells by RT-PCR.
RESULTS: Different levels of Snail, Slug, ZEB1, SIP1 and Twist1 were detected in 
both LNCaP and LNCaP/HIF1alpha cells, with significant differences only in the
expressions of Slug and Twist1 between the two cells. The expression of Slug was 
increased, but that of Twist1 decreased in the LNCaP/HIF1alpha cells. All the
five transcription factors but Twist1 were expressed in both the IF11 and IA8
cells, but only the express- sions of ZEB1 and Slug were increased significantly 
in the IA8 cells.
CONCLUSION: There are different mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation 
in different prostate cancer EMT models. Slug may be one of the key transcription
factors involved in the HIF1alpha-induced EMT of LNCaP cells, while ZEB1 and Slug
may play an important role in repressing the epithelial phenotype of the ARCaP
model.

Negative regulation of the tight junction protein tricellulin by snail-induced
epithelial-mesenchymal transition in gastric carcinoma cells.

School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.

OBJECTIVE: Tricellulin plays a central role in the sealing of epithelia at
tricellular contacts. We examined the effects of Snail, an epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT)-related transcription factor, on the regulation of tricellulin
expression in human gastric carcinoma (GC)-derived cells.
METHOD: Six human GC-derived cell lines were used in this study. Expression and
localization of tricellulin was analyzed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and
immunohistochemistry. Also, a Snail expression vector was transfected into HSC-45
cells to examine altered mRNA levels of tricellulin,E-cadherin, vimentin,
N-cadherin and several EMT transcription factors by quantitative real-time
RT-PCR.
RESULTS: Abundant tricellulin expression was detected in all GC-derived cells
examined. In HSC-45 cells, transduction of Snail decreased the expression levels 
of tricellulin and E-cadherin but increased vimentin and N-cadherin, which was
accompanied by induction of EMT transcription factors such as Twist1, Twist2 and 
Slug. In normal gastric mucosa, tricellulin protein was localized at the
tricellular tight junction; however, in HSC-45 cells, tricellulin protein was
distributed in the cytoplasm. In GC tissues, tricellulin expression at the
cellular membrane was retained in a subset of EMT-negative GCs, and it
disappeared in EMT-positive GCs.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings in the present study suggest that repression of
tricellulin expression may be related to Snail-induced EMT in human GCs.

311. Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Classic Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS) is characterized
by coronal synostosis (unilateral or bilateral), facial asymmetry (particularly
in individuals with unilateral coronal synostosis), ptosis, and characteristic
appearance of the ear (small pinna with a prominent crus). Syndactyly of digits
two and three of the hand is variably present. Intelligence is usually normal,
although those with large genomic deletions are more likely to have developmental
delays. Less common manifestations of SCS include short stature, parietal
foramina, vertebral fusions, radioulnar synostosis, cleft palate, maxillary
hypoplasia, ocular hypertelorism, hallux valgus, duplicated distal hallucal
phalanx, and congenital heart malformations.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of SCS is primarily based on clinical findings. 
TWIST1 is the only gene in which mutations are known to cause SCS. Occasionally, 
affected individuals have a chromosome translocation involving 7p21 or ring
chromosome 7.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Cranioplasty in the first year of life
to prevent progressive facial asymmetry in those with asymmetric coronal fusion
and to prevent increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in those with multiple
sutural synostosis; midfacial surgery as needed for dental malocclusion,
swallowing difficulties, and respiratory problems. If a cleft palate is present, 
surgical repair usually follows cranioplasty. As needed: orthodontic treatment
and/or orthognathic surgery at the completion of facial growth; developmental
intervention; routine treatment of hearing loss; ophthalmologic evaluation and,
if ptosis is present, intervention to prevent amblyopia, with surgical repair
during early childhood as needed. Prevention of secondary complications:
Attention to possible cervical vertebral instability secondary to vertebral
anomalies. Surveillance: Periodic ophthalmologic evaluation for chronic
papilledema, strabismus, or amblyopia, or brain imaging in later life for
evidence of increased intracranial pressure (ICP); routine re-evaluation for
facial asymmetry, psychomotor development, and hearing loss.
GENETIC COUNSELING: SCS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Many
individuals diagnosed with SCS have an affected parent; the proportion of cases
caused by a de novo mutation is unknown. Each child of an individual with SCS has
a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at
increased risk is possible if the disease-causing mutation has been identified in
the family; however, requests for prenatal testing for conditions such as SCS are
not common.

Enrichment for breast cancer cells with stem/progenitor properties by
differential adhesion.

Cancer stem cells are commonly isolated by cell sorting for surface antigens that
typify stem cells. This technique is very expensive, requiring advanced,
high-speed sorters and high-quality antibodies, and yields are often low. Some
stem cells can be isolated based on ability to exclude dyes, conferred by
expression of membrane transporters, but this property is not universal. Mammary 
stem cells are known to down-regulate cell-cell junctions and exhibit mesenchymal
behaviors in vitro. We predicted that such cells should be readily detachable
from tissue-culture plastic and that this might serve as a basis for their
isolation from differentiated cells. We found that immortalized or transformed
mammary epithelial cells can indeed be resolved into trypsin-sensitive and
trypsin-resistant populations. The former are mesenchymal in morphology and
expression profile and are enriched in stem cell properties such as
mammosphere-forming ability, drug resistance, and CD44 stem cell antigen relative
to the trypsin-resistant population. The latter, in contrast, are cobblestone in 
morphology, epithelial in expression profile, and deficient in mammosphere
formation. After several rounds of differential trypsinization, the
trypsin-sensitive pool had 80-fold higher mammosphere-forming ability than the
trypsin-resistant population and 20-fold higher than the starting population.
This resolution compares favorably with other enrichment methods. Thus, for
relatively differentiated epithelial cell types, differential adhesion may serve 
as an enrichment strategy to increase the stem cell pool for subsequent
manipulations.

Promotion of hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis through matrix metalloproteinase
activation by epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulator Twist1.

E-cadherin loss is a key biological mechanism in tumour invasion. As a main
regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) mechanism-mediated invasion 
and metastasis, Twist1 plays an important role through its regulation of
E-cadherin expression. However, whether or not Twist2 has the same function in
tumour metastasis remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate
the expressions and different roles of Twist1 and Twist2 in human hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). The expressions of Twist1 and Twist2 in HCC tissue were
evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. The role of Twist1 and Twist2 in
invasiveness was also evaluated in vitro by using HCC cell lines. Twist1 nuclear 
overexpression is found to be correlated with HCC metastasis, and its expression 
is negatively correlated with E-cadherin expression in human tissue. Twist2, a
Twist1 homology protein, only expresses in the cytoplasm and shows no significant
correlation with HCC metastasis. By ectopic transfection of Twist1 and Twist2
into the HCC cells, HepG2 and PLC, Twist1 is able to down-regulate E-cadherin
expression and promote matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation, specifically in
MMP2 and MMP9. In functional assays, Twist1 is found to promote invasion in HepG2
and PLC cells, but the invasion ability of the groups is not affected Twist2. Our
findings indicate that Twist1 induces HCC invasion via increased activity in
MMPs, leading to poor clinical prognoses. The results of this study also
demonstrate a novel cogitation in Twist2, which has no effect on HCC invasion and
metastasis. Twist1 may contribute to HCC invasion and metastasis and may be used 
as a novel therapeutic target for the inhibition of HCC metastasis.

carcinoma effusions.

The present study investigated the intracellular regulation of E-cadherin in
ovarian carcinoma. E-cadherin expression and regulation by Snail and Pak1 were
studied in ES-2 and OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells in vitro. Twist1, Zeb1 and
Vimentin mRNA expression and HIF-1alpha protein expression were analyzed in 80
and 189 clinical specimens, respectively. OVCAR-3 cells incubated with an
anti-E-cadherin antibody formed smaller and looser spheroids compared to
controls. Snail silencing using Small Hairpin RNA in ES-2 cells reduced invasion 
and MMP-2 activity, with unaltered cellular morphology. Using dominant negative
(DN) and constitutively active (CA) Pak1 constructs, we found that DN Pak1 ES-2
and OVCAR-3 clones had reduced attachment to matrix proteins, invasion and MMP-2 
activity compared to CA and wild-type cells. DN Pak1 ES-2 cells also bound less
to LP9 mesothelial cells. DN Pak1 OVCAR-3 cells had lower Vimentin levels. Snail 
expression was lower in cultured effusions compared to primary carcinomas, and
was cytoplasmic rather than nuclear. Twist1 (P < 0.001), Zeb1 (P = 0.003) and
Vimentin (P = 0.03) mRNA expression was significantly higher in solid metastases 
compared to primary carcinomas and effusions. HIF-1alpha protein expression was
lower in effusions compared to primary carcinomas and solid metastases (P =
0.033). Our data suggest that the previously reported E-cadherin re-expression in
ovarian carcinoma effusions is regulated by Pak1. The transient nature of
E-cadherin expression during ovarian carcinoma progression is probably the result
of partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the reverse process of 
mesenchymal-to-epithelial-like transition (MET). Expression of the EMT-related
molecules Twist, Zeb1, Vimentin and HIF-1alpha is anatomic site-dependent in
ovarian carcinoma.

hsa-mir-210 is a marker of tumor hypoxia and a prognostic factor in head and neck
cancer.

BACKGROUND: Hypoxia is an important mechanism of treatment resistance in head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). MicroRNAs are short noncoding RNAs that
regulate multiple mRNAs and are frequently dysregulated in cancer. The authors
have investigated the role of 3 microRNAs, including the hypoxia-induced
hsa-miR-210, as potential markers of hypoxia or prognosis.
METHODS: Three hypoxia-related microRNAs, hsa-miR-210, hsa-miR-21, and
hsa-miR-10b, were measured in 46 samples from patients with HNSCC. Expression
levels were correlated with clinicopathological variables and other markers of
hypoxia: a published 99-gene hypoxia metagene, individual hypoxia-related genes
such as TWIST1, and immunohistochemical expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 
and its target gene carbonic anhydrase 9. We then performed survival analyses to 
investigate the prognostic significance of these microRNAs.
RESULTS: Only the level of hsa-miR-210 was significantly correlated with other
markers of hypoxia, including the 99-gene hypoxia metagene (rho = 0.67, P <
.001). We found no association between hsa-miR-210, hsa-miR-21, or hsa-miR-10b
and clinicopathological variables such as tumor size, differentiation, and stage.
However, high levels of hsa-miR-210 were associated with locoregional disease
recurrence (P = .001) and short overall survival (P = .008). hsa-miR-21 and
hsa-miR-10b had no prognostic significance.
CONCLUSIONS: Expression of hsa-miR-210 in head and neck cancer correlates with
other approaches for assessing hypoxia and is associated with prognosis. This
warrants further study as a classification marker of patients for therapies
involving modulation of hypoxia.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical, speech, hearing, and imaging findings in
three members of a Brazilian family with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS) who
presented some unusual characteristics within the spectrum of the syndrome.
DESIGN: Clinical evaluation was performed by a multidisciplinary team. Direct
sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified coding region of the TWIST1
gene, routine and electrophysiological hearing evaluation, speech evaluation, and
imaging studies through computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) were performed.
RESULTS: TWIST1 gene analysis revealed a Pro136His mutation in all patients.
Hearing evaluation showed peripherial and mixed hearing loss in two of the
patients, one of them with severe unilateral microtia. Computed tomography scan
showed structural middle ear anomalies, and MRI showed distortion of the skull
contour as well as some of the brain structures.
CONCLUSIONS: We report a previously undescribed TWIST1 gene mutation in patients 
with SCS. There is evidence that indicates hearing loss (conductive and mixed)
can be related both with middle ear (microtia, high jugular bulb, and enlarged
vestibules) as well as with brain stem anomalies. Here we discuss the
relationship between the gene mutation and the clinical, imaging, speech, and
hearing findings.

Gene promoter CpG island hypermethylation is associated with Helicobacter pylori 
(H. pylori) infection and may be an important initiator of gastric
carcinogenesis. To examine factors influencing methylation, we utilized bisulfite
Pyrosequencing® technology for quantitative analysis of promoter DNA methylation 
in RPRM, APC, MGMT and TWIST1 genes using DNA from 86 gastric biopsies from
Colombian residents of areas with high and low incidence of gastric cancer. H.
pylori colonies were cultured from the same subjects, and gastric pathology was
evaluated. Virulence factors cagA (including segments of the 3' end, encoding
EPIYA polymorphisms) and vacA s and m regions were characterized in the H. pylori
strains. Using univariate analysis, we found significantly elevated levels of
RPRM and TWIST1 promoter DNA methylation in biopsies from residents of the
high-risk region compared to those from residents of the low-risk region. The
presence of cagA and vacA s1m1 alleles were independently associated with
elevated levels of promoter DNA methylation of RPRM and MGMT. Using multivariate 
analysis, DNA methylation of RPRM was associated with location of residence, cagA
and vacA s1m1 status and methylation of TWIST1. We conclude that cagA and vacA
virulence determinants are significantly associated with quantitative differences
in promoter DNA methylation in these populations, but that other as yet undefined
factors that differ between the populations may also contribute to variation in
methylation status.

Cancer cells show characteristic gene expression profiles. Recent studies support
the potential importance of microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures as biomarkers 
and therapeutic targets. The membrane-anchored protease regulator RECK is
downregulated in many cancers, and forced expression of RECK in tumor cells
results in decreased malignancy in animal models. RECK is also essential for
mammalian development. In this study, we found that RECK is a target of at least 
three groups of miRNAs (miR-15b/16, miR-21 and miR-372/373); that RECK mutants
lacking the target sites for these miRNA show augmented
tumor/metastasis-suppressor activities; and that miR-372/373 are upregulated in
response to hypoxia through HIF1alpha and TWIST1, whereas miR-21 is upregulated
by RAS/ERK signaling. These data indicate that the hypoxia- and RAS-signaling
pathways converge on RECK through miRNAs, cooperatively downregulating this tumor
suppressor and thereby promoting malignant cell behavior.

Although growing evidence demonstrates that TWIST1 is an interesting tumor
biomarker, little is known about the clinical significance of TWIST1 expression
and TWIST1 methylation in human primary colorectal cancer. In this study, we
examined the association of TWIST1 expression and TWIST1 methylation with
clinicopathologic features in human primary colorectal tumors. Primary colorectal
cancer (CRC) specimens from 319 patients, corresponding normal colorectal
nontumorous mucosa from 251 patients with cancer, and colorectal adenomas from
189 patients were used. Methylation and expression levels of TWIST1 were compared
with clinicopathologic features. The TWIST1 methylation level was higher in
colorectal adenoma and cancer than in normal colorectal mucosa. Elevated TWIST1
mRNA expression in normal colorectal mucosa in patients with CRC as well as in
primary CRC specimens was associated with unfavorable outcomes. There was no
correlation between TWIST1 methylation and TWIST1 expression. Our results suggest
that TWIST1 methylation may be a useful biomarker for screening colorectal
tumors. In addition, TWIST1 mRNA expression is a possible molecular marker for
predicting the outcome in patients with CRC. Confirmatory studies using
independent data sets are needed to confirm our findings.

CHD7 cooperates with PBAF to control multipotent neural crest formation.

Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the CHD (chromodomain helicase
DNA-binding domain) member CHD7, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeller homologous
to the Drosophila trithorax-group protein Kismet, result in a complex
constellation of congenital anomalies called CHARGE syndrome, which is a
sporadic, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by malformations of the
craniofacial structures, peripheral nervous system, ears, eyes and heart.
Although it was postulated 25 years ago that CHARGE syndrome results from the
abnormal development of the neural crest, this hypothesis remained untested. Here
we show that, in both humans and Xenopus, CHD7 is essential for the formation of 
multipotent migratory neural crest (NC), a transient cell population that is
ectodermal in origin but undergoes a major transcriptional reprogramming event to
acquire a remarkably broad differentiation potential and ability to migrate
throughout the body, giving rise to craniofacial bones and cartilages, the
peripheral nervous system, pigmentation and cardiac structures. We demonstrate
that CHD7 is essential for activation of the NC transcriptional circuitry,
including Sox9, Twist and Slug. In Xenopus embryos, knockdown of Chd7 or
overexpression of its catalytically inactive form recapitulates all major
features of CHARGE syndrome. In human NC cells CHD7 associates with PBAF
(polybromo- and BRG1-associated factor-containing complex) and both remodellers
occupy a NC-specific distal SOX9 enhancer and a conserved genomic element located
upstream of the TWIST1 gene. Consistently, during embryogenesis CHD7 and PBAF
cooperate to promote NC gene expression and cell migration. Our work identifies
an evolutionarily conserved role for CHD7 in orchestrating NC gene expression
programs, provides insights into the synergistic control of distal elements by
chromatin remodellers, illuminates the patho-embryology of CHARGE syndrome, and
suggests a broader function for CHD7 in the regulation of cell motility.

Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder
characterised by facial dysmorphisms, growth and psychomotor development delay,
and skeletal defects. The known genetic causes are point mutations or deletions
of the CREBBP (50-60%) and EP300 (5%) genes. To detect chromosomal rearrangements
indicating novel positional candidate RSTS genes, we used a-CGH to study 26
patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for RSTS who were negative at
fluorescence in situ hybridisation analyses of the CREBBP and EP300 regions, and 
direct sequencing analyses of the CREBBP gene. We found seven imbalances (27%):
four de novo and three inherited rearrangements not reported among the copy
number variants. A de novo 7p21.1 deletion of 500 kb included the TWIST1 gene, a 
suggested candidate for RSTS that is responsible for the Saethre-Chotzen
syndrome, an entity that enters in differential diagnosis with RSTS. A similar
issue of differential diagnosis was raised by a large 4.3 Mb 2q22.3q23.1 deletion
encompassing ZEB2, the gene responsible for the Mowat-Wilson syndrome, whose
signs may overlap with RSTS. Positional candidate genes could not be sought in
the remaining pathogenetic imbalances, because of the size of the involved region
(a 9 Mb 2q24.3q31.1 deletion) and/or the relative paucity of suitable genes (a 5 
Mb 3p13p12.3 duplication). One of the inherited rearrangements, the 17q11.2 379Kb
duplication, represents the reciprocal event of the deletion underlying an
overgrowth syndrome, both being mediated by the NF1-REP-P1 and REP-P2
sub-duplicons. The contribution of this and the other detected CNVs to the
clinical RSTS phenotype is difficult to assess.

Genetics of craniosynostosis: review of the literature.

Ciurea AV(1), Toader C.

Author information: 
(1)First Neurosurgical Department, Bagdasar-Arseni Clinical Emergency Hospital,
Bucharest. rsn@bagdasar-arseni.ro

Craniosynostosis represents a defection of the skull caused by early fusion of
one or more cranial sutures. The shape alteration of the cranial vault varies,
depending on the fused sutures, so that compensatory growth occurs in dimensions 
not restricted by sutures. Craniosynostosis can be divided into two main groups: 
syndromic and nonsyndromic. Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis is typically an
isolated finding that is classified according to the suture(s) involved.
Syndromic craniosynostosis is associated with various dysmorphisms involving the 
face, skeleton, nervous system and is usually accompanied by developmental delay.
In the last 15 years, research on craniosynostosis has progressed from the
description of gross abnormalities to the understanding of the genetic basis of
certain cranial deformities. Mutations in the genes encoding fibroblast growth
factor receptors 1, 2 and 3 (FGFR-1, FGFR-2, FGFR-3), TWIST and MSX2 (muscle
segment homebox 2) have been identified in certain syndromic craniosynostosis.
The molecular basis of many types of syndromic craniosynostosis is known and
diagnostic testing strategies will often lead to a specific diagnosis. Although
the clarification of a genetic lesion does not have a direct impact on the
management of the patient in many cases, there is a significant benefit in
providing accurate prenatal diagnosis. This review summarizes the available
knowledge on cranisynostosis and presents a graduated strategy for the genetic
diagnosis of these craniofacial defects.

Telomerase upregulation is a postcrisis event during senescence bypass and
immortalization of two Nijmegen breakage syndrome T cell cultures.

Sweden.

Our knowledge on immortalization and telomere biology is mainly based on
genetically manipulated cells analyzed before and many population doublings post 
growth crisis. The general view is that growth crisis is telomere length (TL)
dependent and that escape from crisis is coupled to increased expression of the
telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene, telomerase activity upregulation
and TL stabilization. Here we have analyzed the process of spontaneous
immortalization of human T cells, regarding pathways involved in senescence and
telomerase regulation. Two Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) T cell cultures (S3R 
and S4) showed gradual telomere attrition until a period of growth crisis
followed by the outgrowth of immortalized cells. Whole genome expression analysis
indicated differences between pre-, early post- and late postcrisis cells. Early 
postcrisis cells demonstrated a logarithmic growth curve, very short telomeres
and, notably, no increase in hTERT or telomerase activity despite downregulation 
of several negative hTERT regulators (e.g. FOS, JUN D, SMAD3, RUNX2, TNF-a and
TGFb-R2). Thereafter, cMYC mRNA increased in parallel with increased hTERT
expression, telomerase activity and elongation of short telomeres, indicating a
step-wise activation of hTERT transcription involving reduction of negative
regulators followed by activation of positive regulator(s). Gene expression
analysis indicated that cells escaped growth crisis by deregulated DNA damage
response and senescence controlling genes, including downregulation of ATM,
CDKN1B (p27), CDKN2D (p19) and ASF1A and upregulation of CDK4, TWIST1, TP73L
(p63) and SYK. Telomerase upregulation was thus found to be uncoupled to escape
of growth crisis but rather a later event in the immortalization process of NBS T
cell cultures.

[Detection of bladder cancer in voided urine samples].

[Article in French]

Thomas A(1), Renard I, Waltregny D.

Author information: 
(1)Service d'Urologie, CHU de Liège, Belgique.

Bladder cancer mainly affects patients aged 50 years or more and requires close
and repeated surveillance. Flexible cystoscopy associated with urinary cytology
are the currently recommended diagnostic and follow-up methods. Because medical
imaging techniques remain rather unsatisfying for bladder carcinoma detection,
research efforts have focused on urinary markers of the disease. Various
approaches were tested with results generally too unconsistant to replace
cystoscopy. Recently, the department of Urology at the University of Liège
together with the Biotechnology Company OncoMethylome Sciences have been
interested in testing whether the detection of hypermethylated genes in voided
urine samples would be of value for the detection of bladder cancer. The method
is based on the Methylation-Specific PCR technology (MSP). This approach has the 
theoretical advantage of being non invasive, reproducible and based on DNA, whose
stability, in urine, is higher than that of proteins. The results of a large
prospective study, recently publised in European Urology, have shown that the
identification by MSP of 2 methylated genes, TWIST1 and NID2, in voided urine
samples, is a sensitive (+/- 90%) and specific (+/- 93%) test for the detection
of bladder cancer. The test is largely more sensitive than cytology while both
techniques have similar specificity. Based on these promising results, we are
currently evaluating this novel, non invasive MSP approach for the follow-up of
patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is known to be associated with both HBV and HCV.
While epigenetic changes have been previously reported to be associated with
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), whether the epigenetic profile of HBC associated 
HCC differs from that of HCV-associated HCC is unclear. We analyzed DNA
methylation of ten genes (APC, CCND2, CDKN2A, GSTP1, HOXA9, RARB, RASSF1, RUNX,
SFRP1, and TWIST1) using MethyLight assays on 65 archived liver tissue blocks.
Three genes (APC, CCND2, and GSTP1) were frequently methylated in normal liver
tissues. Five genes (APC, CDKN2A, HOXA9, RASSF1, and RUNX) were significantly
more frequently methylated in malignant liver tissues than normal liver tissues. 
Among HCC cases, HOXA9, RASSF1 and SFRP1 were methylated more frequently in
HBV-positive HCC cases, while CDKN2A were significantly more frequently
methylated in HCV-positive HCC cases. Our data support the hypothesis that HCC
resulting from different viral etiologies is associated with different epigenetic
changes.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between the expression of transcription
factor TWIST and apoptosis of Hep-2 cells induced by paclitaxel.
METHODS: Morphological changes of Hep-2 cells were observed by reserved
microscopy and acridine orange cytochemistry staining. Viability of Hep-2 cells
treated with various concentrations of paclitaxel was detected by MTT assay.
Apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. The expressions of transcription factor
TWIST at both mRNA and protein level in response to paclitaxel at 24 h, 48 h and 
72 h were then examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively.
RESULTS: Typical morphological changes of apoptotic cells, i.e., cellular
rounding-up, cytoplasmic contraction, chromatin condensation and, particularly,
apoptotic body, the main morphological characteristic of apoptosis, were observed
by reserved microscopy and acridine orange cytochemistry staining. The cell
surviving rates significantly decreased in a concentration- and time-dependent
manner as evidenced by MTT assay (P < 0.05). Percent of apoptosis after 24 h, 48 
h or 72 h paclitaxel-treatment was (22.6 +/- 5.3)%, (38.7 +/- 7.9)% and (52.4 +/-
14.3)%, respectively, whereas the percent of control was (9.85 +/- 5.83)%. There 
existed a statistically significant difference between treatment and control (F =
12.621, P < 0.05). The expression of TWIST at both mRNA and protein levels for 24
h, 48 h or 72 h in the paclitaxel-induced apoptosis of Hep-2 cells were decreased
by 16.7%, 46.8%, 76.9% (F = 10.407, P < 0.05) and 16.4%, 33.6%, 69.6% (F =
18.013, P < 0.05) respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: TWIST, which is significantly decreased in expression in response to
paclitaxel in Hep-2 cells, may play a pivotal role in paclitaxel-induced
apoptosis of Hep-2 cells.

NF-kappaB-dependent plasticity of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition
induced by Von Hippel-Lindau inactivation in renal cell carcinomas.

California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095-1738, USA.

The critical downstream signaling consequences contributing to renal cancer as a 
result of loss of the tumor suppressor gene von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) have yet to
be fully elucidated. Here, we report that VHL loss results in an epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT). In studies of paired isogenic cell lines, VHL
silencing increased the levels of N-cadherin and vimentin and reduced the levels 
of E-cadherin relative to the parental VHL(+) cell line, which displayed the
opposite profile. VHL(+) cells grew as clusters of cuboidal and rhomboid cells,
whereas VHL-silenced cells took on an elongated, fibroblastoid morphology
associated with a more highly invasive character in Matrigel chamber assays.
Based on earlier evidence that VHL loss can activate NF-kappaB, a known mediator 
of EMT, we tested whether NF-kappaB contributed to VHL-mediated effects on EMT.
On pharmacologic or molecular inhibition of NF-kappaB, VHL-silenced cells
regained expression of E-cadherin, lost expression of N-cadherin, and reversed
their highly invasive phenotype. Introducing a pVHL-resistant hypoxia-inducible
factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) mutant (HIFalpha(M)) into VHL(+) cells heightened
NF-kappaB activity, phenocopying EMT effects produced by VHL silencing.
Conversely, inhibiting the heightened NF-kappaB activity in this setting reversed
the EMT phenotype. Taken together, these results suggest that VHL loss induces an
EMT that is largely dependent on HIFalpha-induced NF-kappaB. Our findings
rationalize targeting the NF-kappaB pathway as a therapeutic strategy to treat
renal tumors characterized by biallelic VHL inactivation.

PURPOSE: Genomic alterations (including gene hypermethylation) are likely to
precede the phenotypic changes associated with breast tumorigenesis. From a
prospective collection of ductal lavage (DL) samples from women with a known
mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2, we have assessed promoter methylation with a
comparison of results with several variables, including breast cancer (BC)
outcome.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Hypermethylation of p16, RASSF1A, twist, and RARbeta was
assessed using a qualitative, real-time, nested PCR assay. Associations between
methylation status and variables were tested using Fisher's exact test or
logistic regression. Analyses were done at three levels: a single breast, a
single duct (both over time), and each DL sample in isolation.
RESULTS: A total of 168 samples from 93 ducts in 54 breasts have been analyzed in
34 women (16 BRCA1 and 18 BRCA2 mutation carriers). A median of 2 DL was done
(range, 1-5), with 7 women developing BC on study, 1 bilateral. Methylation of
p16 was associated with a known BRCA1 mutation (P = 0.001, P < 0.001, and P <
0.001 for breast, duct, and sample levels, respectively) and women with a history
of contralateral BC (P = 0.001 and P < 0.001 for duct and sample levels,
respectively). An association was seen for women who developed BC on study and
RASSF1A methylation (P = 0.001 for sample level).
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic methylation patterns could potentially be used to predict
future BC risk. In addition, p16 methylation may be a predictor of BRCA1 mutation
status. Further research is required to corroborate these findings.

E-cadherin (E-cad) is an adhesion molecule associated with tumor invasion and
metastasis. Its down-regulation is associated with poor prognosis for many
epithelial tumor types. We have profiled E-cad in the NCI-60 cancer cell lines at
the DNA, RNA, and protein levels using six different microarray platforms plus
bisulfite sequencing. Here we consider the effects on E-cad expression of eight
potential regulatory factors: E-cad promoter DNA methylation, the transcript
levels of six transcriptional repressors (SNAI1, SNAI2, TCF3, TCF8, TWIST1, and
ZFHX1B), and E-cad DNA copy number. Combined bioinformatic and pharmacological
analyses indicate the following ranking of influence on E-cad expression: (1)
E-cad promoter methylation appears predominant, is strongly correlated with E-cad
expression, and shows a 20% to 30% threshold above which E-cad expression is
silenced; (2) TCF8 expression levels correlate with (-0.62) and predict (P <
0.00001) E-cad expression; (3) SNAI2 and ZFHX1B expression levels correlate
positively with each other (+0.83) and also correlate with (-0.32 and -0.30,
respectively) and predict (P = 0.03 and 0.01, respectively) E-cad expression; (4)
TWIST1 correlates with (-0.34) but does not predict E-cad expression; and (5)
SNAI1 expression, TCF3 expression, and E-cad DNA copy number do not correlate
with or predict E-cad expression. Predictions of E-cad regulation based on the
above factors were tested and verified by demethylation studies using
5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment; siRNA knock-down of TCF8, SNAI2, or ZFHX1B
expression; and combined treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and TCF8 siRNA.
Finally, levels of cellular E-cad expression are associated with levels of
cell-cell adhesion and response to drug treatment.

HIF-1alpha mediates the induction of IL-8 and VEGF expression on infection with
Afa/Dr diffusely adhering E. coli and promotes EMT-like behaviour.

Microbes regulate a large panel of intracellular signalling events that can
promote inflammation and/or enhance tumour progression. Indeed, it has been shown
that infection of human intestinal cells with the Afa/Dr diffusely adhering E.
coli C1845 strain induces expression of pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory
genes. Here, we demonstrate that exposure of cryptic-like intestinal epithelial
cells to C1845 bacteria induces HIF-1alpha protein levels. This effect depends on
the binding of F1845 adhesin to the membrane-associated DAF receptor that
initiates signalling cascades promoting translational mechanisms. Indeed,
inhibition of MAPK and PI-3K decreases HIF-1alpha protein levels and blocks
C1845-induced phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein. Using RNA interference
we show that bacteria-induced HIF-1alpha regulates the expression of IL-8, VEGF
and Twist1, thereby pointing to a role for HIF-1 in angiogenesis and
inflammation. In addition, infection correlates with a loss of E-cadherin and
cytokeratin 18 and a rise in fibronectin, suggesting that bacteria may induce an 
epithelial to mesenchymal transition-like phenotype. Since HIF-1alpha silencing
results in reversion of bacteria-induced EMT markers, we speculate that
HIF-1alpha plays a key role linking bacterial infection to angiogenesis,
inflammation and some aspects of cancer initiation.

Center, ML 7020, 240 Albert Sabin Way, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.

The development and normal function of the heart valves requires complex
interactions among signaling molecules, transcription factors and structural
proteins that are tightly regulated in time and space. Here we review the roles
of critical transcription factors that are required for specific aspects of
normal valve development. The early progenitors of the heart valves are localized
in endocardial cushions that express transcription factors characteristic of
mesenchyme, including Twist1, Tbx20, Msx1 and Msx2. As the valve leaflets mature,
they are composed of complex stratified extracellular matrix proteins that are
regulated by the transcriptional functions of NFATc1, Sox9, and Scleraxis. Each
of these factors has analogous functions in differentiation of related connective
tissue lineages. Together, the precise timing and localized functions of specific
transcription factors control cell proliferation, differentiation, elongation,
and remodeling processes that are necessary for normal valve structure and
function. In addition, there is increasing evidence that these same transcription
factors contribute to congenital, as well as degenerative, valve disease.

The incidence of limb bone fracture and subsequent morbidity and mortality due to
excessive bone loss is increasing in the progressively ageing populations of both
men and women. In contrast to bone loss in the weight-bearing limb, bone mass in 
the protective skull vault is maintained. One explanation for this could be
anatomically diverse bone matrix characteristics generated by heterogeneous
osteoblast populations. We have tested the hypothesis that adult bones
demonstrate site-specific characteristics, and report differences at the organ,
cell and transcriptome levels. Limb bones contain greater amounts of
polysulphated glycosaminoglycan stained with Alcian Blue and have significantly
higher osteocyte densities than skull bone. Site-specific patterns persist in
cultured adult bone-derived cells both phenotypically (proliferation rate,
response to estrogen and cell volumes), and at the level of specific gene
expression (collagen triple helix repeat containing 1, reelin and ras-like and
estrogen-regulated growth inhibitor). Based on genome-wide mRNA expression and
cluster analysis, we demonstrate that bones and cultured adult bone-derived cells
segregate according to site of derivation. We also find the differential
expression of genes associated with embryological development (Skull: Zic, Dlx,
Irx, Twist1 and Cart1; Limb: Hox, Shox2, and Tbx genes) in both adult bones and
isolated adult bone-derived cells. Together, these site-specific differences
support the view that, analogous to different muscle types (cardiac, smooth and
skeletal), skull and limb bones represent separate classes of bone. We assign
these differences, not to mode of primary ossification, but to the embryological 
cell lineage; the basis and implications of this division are discussed.

Genetic fate mapping demonstrates contribution of epicardium-derived cells to the
annulus fibrosis of the mammalian heart.

The annulus fibrosis electrically insulates the atria and ventricles, allowing
the timed sequential beating of these structures that is necessary for efficient 
heart function. Abnormal development of the annulus fibrosis leads to persistence
of accessory electrical pathways from atria to ventricles, providing the
anatomical substrate for re-entrant cardiac arrhythmias such as
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. To better understand the development of the
annulus fibrosis and the etiology of these cardiac arrhythmias, we used Cre-LoxP 
technology to assess the contribution of epicardium derived cells (EPDCs) to the 
annulus fibrosis. We found that EPDCs migrated into the region of the forming
annulus fibrosis, marked by the protein periostin. These EPDCs also stained
positive for procollagen I, suggesting that the EPDCs themselves synthesize
proteins of the annulus fibrosis. To further test the hypothesis that EPDCs
contribute to cells that synthesize the annulus fibrosis, we purified genetically
marked EPDCs from the atrioventricular region and measured gene expression by
quantitative PCR. These EPDCs were highly enriched for mRNAs encoding periostin, 
procollagen I, fibronectin I, vimentin, discoidin domain receptor 2, and tenascin
C, markers of fibroblasts and components of the annulus fibrosis. In addition,
these EPDCs were highly enriched for Snail, Smad1, Slug, and Twist1, markers for 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and a metalloprotease, Mmp2, that
contributes to cellular migration. Our work provides for the first time
definitive evidence that epicardium contributes to formation of the mammalian
annulus fibrosis through EMT. Abnormalities of this differentiation process may
underlie development of some forms of re-entrant atrioventricular tachycardia.

Twist modulates breast cancer stem cells by transcriptional regulation of CD24
expression.

Hopkins University School of Medicine, Traylor 338, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.

The cancer stem cell paradigm postulates that dysregulated tissue-specific stem
cells or progenitor cells are precursors for cancer biogenesis. Consequently,
identifying cancer stem cells is crucial to our understanding of cancer
progression and for the development of novel therapeutic agents. In this study,
we demonstrate that the overexpression of Twist in breast cells can promote the
generation of a breast cancer stem cell phenotype characterized by the high
expression of CD44, little or no expression of CD24, and increased aldehyde
dehydrogenase 1 activity, independent of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
In addition, Twist-overexpressing cells exhibit high efflux of Hoechst 33342 and 
Rhodamine 123 as a result of increased expression of ABCC1 (MRP1) transporters, a
property of cancer stem cells. Moreover, we show that transient expression of
Twist can induce the stem cell phenotype in multiple breast cell lines and that
decreasing Twist expression by short hairpin RNA in Twist-overexpressing
transgenic cell lines MCF-10A/Twist and MCF-7/Twist as well as in MDA-MB-231
partially reverses the stem cell molecular signature. Importantly, we show that
inoculums of only 20 cells of the Twist-overexpressing CD44(+)/CD24(-/low)
subpopulation are capable of forming tumors in the mammary fat pad of severe
combined immunodeficient mice. Finally, with respect to mechanism, we provide
data to indicate that Twist transcriptionally regulates CD24 expression in breast
cancer cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate the direct involvement of
Twist in generating a breast cancer stem cell phenotype through down-regulation
of CD24 expression and independent of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

OBJECTIVE: Twist1 is a transcription factor that is highly expressed in murine
brown and white adipose tissue (WAT) and negatively regulates fatty acid
oxidation in mice. The role of twist1 in WAT is not known and was therefore
examined.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The expression of twist1 was determined by
quantitative real-time PCR in different tissues and in different cell types
within adipose tissue. The effect of twist1 small interfering RNA on fatty acid
oxidation, lipolysis, adipokine secretion, and mRNA expression was determined in 
human adipocytes. The interaction between twist1 and specific promoters in human 
adipocytes was investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and reporter 
assays.
RESULTS: Twist1 was highly expressed in human WAT compared with a set of other
tissues and found predominantly in adipocytes. Twist1 levels increased during in 
vitro differentiation of human preadipocytes. Gene silencing of twist1 in human
white adipocytes had no effect on lipolysis or glucose transport. Unexpectedly,
and in contrast with results in mice, twist1 RNA interference reduced fatty acid 
oxidation. Furthermore, the expression and secretion of the inflammatory factors 
tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1 were downregulated by twist1 silencing. ChIP and reporter assays
confirmed twist1 interaction with the promoters of these genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Twist1 may play a role in inflammation of human WAT because it can
regulate the expression and secretion of inflammatory adipokines via direct
transcriptional effects in white adipocytes. Furthermore, twist1 may, in contrast
to findings in mice, be a positive regulator of fatty acid oxidation in human
white adipocytes.

cancer.

(1)shuyongqian@csco.org.cn

BACKGROUND: Several gene expression signatures have been reported to predict
patient survival of gastric cancer after surgical resection. However, the
prognostic gene lists have overlapped poorly until now. This study conducted an
analysis to characterize gene expression profile and developed a survival
prediction model.
METHODS: The gene expression profile was evaluated in fresh frozen tumor tissue
obtained from 48 patients with primary gastric cancer. We measured 84
representative genes involved in transformation and tumorigenesis using
quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and
related the results to overall survival.
RESULTS: In a univariate analysis, 84 genes were ranked on their ability to
predict survival, of which nine genes were the strongest predictor (P<0.05). They
were PLAU, MAP2K1, THBS1, TWIST1, ITGB5, NME4, ANGPT2, platelet-derived growth
factor B (PDGFB), ITGB1. Then, we did a multivariate analysis to further select
four genes (ITGB1, PDGFB, THBS1, TWIST1) from the above nine genes for the
construction of biomathematics model, which was independent of age, gender, TNM
stage and other variables. This model could correctly clarify gastric patients
into the high-risk group, median-risk group and low-risk group, as well as
predict their survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of the expression of four genes is probable to predict
surgery-related survival. This model may be test further for its potential to
improve the selection of the resected gastric cancer patients in adjuvant
chemotherapy.

Expression and functional significance of Twist1 in hepatocellular carcinoma: its
role in vasculogenic mimicry.

The up-regulation and nuclear relocation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) regulator Twist1 have been implicated in the tumor invasion and metastasis 
of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The term vasculogenic mimicry (VM)
refers to the unique capability of aggressive tumor cells to mimic the pattern of
embryonic vasculogenic networks. However, the relationship between Twist1 and VM 
formation is not clear. In this study, we explored HCC as a VM and EMT model in
order to investigate the role of Twist1 in VM formation. We first examined the
expression of Twist1 in human HCC samples and cell lines and found that Twist1
was frequently overexpressed in the nuclear relocation occurring in VM-positive
HCCs (13/18 [72%]). Twist1 nuclear expression was likewise significantly
associated with VM formation. Clinicopathological analysis revealed that both VM 
and Twist1 nuclear expressions present shorter survival durations than those
without expression. We consistently demonstrated that an overexpression of Twist1
significantly enhanced cell motility, invasiveness, and VM formation in an HepG2 
cell. Conversely, a knockdown of Twist1 by the short hairpin RNA approach
remarkably reduced Bel7402 cell migration, invasion, and VM formation. Using
chromatin immunoprecipitation, we also showed that Twist1 binds to the vascular
endothelial (VE)-cadherin promoter and enhances its activity in a transactivation
assay.CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that Twist1 induces HCC cell
plasticity in VM cells more through the suppression of E-cadherin expression and 
the induction of VE-cadherin up-regulation than through the VM pattern in vivo
and in a three-dimensional in vitro system. Our findings also demonstrate a novel
cogitation in cancer stem-like cell differentiation and that related molecular
pathways may be used as novel therapeutic targets for the inhibition of HCC
angiogenesis and metastasis.

Epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) is a 120 kDa cell-cell adhesion molecule
involved in the establishment of epithelial adherens junctions. It is connected
to the actin cytoskeleton by adaptor proteins such as beta-catenin. Loss of
E-cadherin expression/function has been related to tumor progression and
metastasis. Several molecules associated with down-regulation of E-cadherin have 
been described, within them neural cadherin, Twist and dysadherin. Human breast
cancer cell lines IBH-6 and IBH-4 were developed from ductal primary tumors and
show characteristic features of malignant epithelial cells. In this study
expression of E-cadherin and related proteins in IBH-6 and IBH-4 cell lines was
evaluated. In IBH-6 and IBH-4 cell extracts, only an 89 kDa E-cadherin form
(Ecad89) was detected, which is truncated at the C-terminus and is present at low
levels. Moreover, no accumulation of the 86 kDa E-cadherin ectodomain and of the 
38 kDa CTF1 fragment was observed. IBH-6 and IBH-4 cells showed an intracellular 
scattered E-cadherin localization. beta-catenin accompanied E-cadherin
localization, and actin stress fibers were identified in both cell types.
E-cadherin mRNA levels were remarkably low in IBH-6 and IBH-4 cells. The
E-cadherin mRNA and genomic sequence encoding exons 14-16 could not be amplified 
in either cell line. Neither the mRNA nor the protein of neural cadherin and
dysadherin were detected. Up-regulation of Twist mRNA was found in both cell
lines. In conclusion, IBH-6 and IBH-4 breast cancer cells show down-regulation of
E-cadherin expression with aberrant protein localization, and up-regulation of
Twist; these features can be related to their invasive/metastatic
characteristics.

The transcription factor SNAIL1 is a master regulator of epithelial to
mesenchymal transition. SNAIL1 is a very unstable protein, and its levels are
regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase beta-TrCP1 that interacts with SNAIL1 upon
its phosphorylation by GSK-3beta. Here we show that SNAIL1 polyubiquitylation and
degradation may occur in conditions precluding SNAIL1 phosphorylation by
GSK-3beta, suggesting that additional E3 ligases participate in the control of
SNAIL1 protein stability. In particular, we demonstrate that the F-box E3
ubiquitin ligase FBXl14 interacts with SNAIL1 and promotes its ubiquitylation and
proteasome degradation independently of phosphorylation by GSK-3beta. In vivo,
inhibition of FBXl14 using short hairpin RNA stabilizes both ectopically
expressed and endogenous SNAIL1. Moreover, the expression of FBXl14 is potently
down-regulated during hypoxia, a condition that increases the levels of SNAIL1
protein but not SNAIL1 mRNA. FBXL14 mRNA is decreased in tumors with a high
expression of two proteins up-regulated in hypoxia, carbonic anhydrase 9 and
TWIST1. In addition, Twist1 small interfering RNA prevents hypoxia-induced Fbxl14
down-regulation and SNAIL1 stabilization in NMuMG cells. Altogether, these
results demonstrate the existence of an alternative mechanism controlling SNAIL1 
protein levels relevant for the induction of SNAIL1 during hypoxia.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether down-regulation of Twist1 could change
sensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line HNE1 to taxol.
METHODS: HNE1 cells were transfected with the small interfering RNA (siRNA)
expression vector pSuppressor-Retro-Si-Twist, containing the short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) sequence targeting the Twist gene-coding region by Fugene 6. Positive
clones were then selected in Neomycin (400 microg/ml) for 21 days. The low
expressions of Twist1 were examined by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. Drug sensitivity of si-Twist1 HNE1 to
taxol was determined by Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate( FITC)/propidium
lodide (PI) double-labeled flow cytometry and detection of DNA ladder. The Effect
of Twist1 inactivation on HNE1 cell proliferation was observed by MTT assay and
flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Annexin V- FITC-PI assay showed that apoptosis ratio was 40.2% in
si-Twist HNE1 after treated with 10 ng/ml taxol, significantly higher than that
in the control siRNA group 24.3%. The deference had statistic meaning. After the 
re-expression of HNE1, apoptosis ratio was 44.80% +/- 4.80% (x +/- s) in low
Twist1 protein expression group and that was 27.00% +/- 2.91% in high expression 
group. The deference had statistic meaning (t = 4.374, P = 0.049). Real time PCR 
test revealed apoptosis protein bcl-2 expression in si-Twist HNE1 was 0.28 +/-
0.05, significantly lower than that in the control siRNA HNE1 (0.57 +/- 0.08, t =
6.710, P = 0.021), nevertheless, significant bax and bcl-XL changes were not
observed (t = 2.000, P = 0.184 and t = 1.502, P = 0.272). MTT and FCM showed that
down-regulation of Twist1 did not alter cell proliferation rate (P>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Down-regulation of Twist1 could increase drug sensitivity of
nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line HNE1 to taxol by inducing apoptosis. These
results suggested that Twist1 may be a promising treatment target for
nasopharyngeal carcinoma therapy.

The natural history of patients treated for TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Chotzen
syndrome.

Foo R(1), Guo Y, McDonald-McGinn DM, Zackai EH, Whitaker LA, Bartlett SP.

Author information: 
(1)Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of
Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

BACKGROUND: Patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome have a heterogeneous
phenotype. The purpose of this study was to use the genotypic diagnosis of the
authors' series of patients with TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome to
describe their natural history and long-term surgical outcomes.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients treated at The
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Chotzen
syndrome (n = 22) over 23 years (1985 to 2008). Their phenotype, need for primary
cranial vault remodeling surgery, and subsequent need for reoperation were
recorded. Genetic records were reviewed to identify each patient's TWIST1
mutation.
RESULTS: There were nine female patients and 13 male patients. Ten had bicoronal 
(45 percent), six had unicoronal (27 percent), and four had multisuture (18
percent) craniosynostosis. One had metopic and another had sagittal
craniosynostosis. Average follow-up was 7.6 years (range, birth to 19.6 years).
Seventeen (77 percent) underwent initial cranial vault remodeling and 10 (59
percent) required repeat intracranial vault remodeling (Whitaker class IV). One
patient required major reoperation with bone grafting (Whitaker class III). Three
patients needed minor revision procedures (Whitaker class II). Three patients
needed no further intervention (Whitaker class I). The locations of the TWIST1
gene mutations in this study did not correlate to a specific surgical outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is heterogeneous and
manifests as either mild or severe craniofacial deformities. Our patients with
TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome had a reoperation rate of 65 percent
for Whitaker class III and IV surgical outcome, and 59 percent required a
secondary intracranial procedure for recurrent supraorbital retrusion.

Oxidative stress drives disulfide bond formation between basic helix-loop-helix
transcription factors.

Danciu TE(1), Whitman M.

Author information:

Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.

Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors including Twist1 and E2a
proteins regulate essential processes. These factors bind DNA as homo- or
heterodimers and the choice of binding partners determines their functional
output. To investigate potential regulators of bHLH dimerization, cells were
exposed to the oxidative agent hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Western blot
analysis in the presence or absence of reducing agents, revealed that H(2)O(2)
induces the rapid formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond between Twist1
homodimers and Twist/E2a proteins heterodimers. The disulfide bond is first
observed between Twist1 homodimers at 25 mM H(2)O(2) and between Twist1
heterodimers at 75 mM H(2)O(2). This response is dependent upon cell density as
H(2)O(2) did not induce disulfide bridge formation between bHLH proteins in cells
seeded at high density. In the presence of E proteins, the formation of
Twist1/E2a proteins heterodimers is favored over Twist1 homodimers, identifying
an oxidative stimulus as an important factor in modulating binding partner
specificity. We further demonstrated that a cysteine residue located at the
C-terminus of Twist1 and E2a proteins is involved in this response. Disulfide
bond formation between Twist1 homodimers significantly reduced its ability to
interact with two of its binding partners, Runx2 and HDAC4, indicating that
disulfide dimerization in response to H(2)O(2) has functional significance. These
data support the conclusion that disulfide bond formation in response to an
oxidative stimulus contributes to Twist1 homo- and heterodimerization and raises 
the possibility that the redox status of a cell may represent an important step
in bHLH transcriptional regulation.

Borderline and malignant phyllodes tumors display similar promoter methylation
profiles.

Mammary phyllodes tumors (PTs) are uncommon fibroepithelial neoplasms. On the
basis of histologic criteria, PTs can be divided into benign, borderline, and
malignant groups; however, the histologic distinction of PTs is often difficult
and arbitrary. In breast cancer, promoter hypermethylation is a common
phenomenon, but there are no data available concerning methylation status in PTs.
The aim of this study was to assess whether the methylation profiles support the 
classification of PTs into three subgroups. A multiplex, nested,
methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction approach was used to examine
promoter methylation of five genes (GSTP1, HIN-1, RAR-beta, RASSF1A, and Twist)
in 87 PTs (54 benign, 23 borderline, and 10 malignant). Immunohistochemical
staining for GSTP1 was performed using tissue microarray blocks to determine
whether GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation correlated with loss of GSTP1 expression.
There was a trend of increasing methylation frequency with increasing grade of
PTs. The methylation frequency of all genes and the mean number of methylated
genes in borderline and malignant PTs were higher than those in benign PTs;
however, there were no statistically significant differences between borderline
and malignant PTs. GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation was associated with loss of
GSTP1 expression (p < 0.001). These results suggest that PTs segregate into only 
two groups on the basis of their methylation profiles: the benign group and the
combined borderline/malignant group.

We present a family segregating for an autosomal dominant syndrome of
hypotelorism, cleft palate/uvula, high-arched palate and mild mental retardation.
Although these findings may suggest a form of holoprosencephaly, no
holoprosencephaly was found on MRI of the proposita. Results of genetic studies
were normal including FISH for deletion of 22q11, karyotype analysis, fragile X
testing, high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization and SEPT9, SHH
mutation analysis. The syndrome is reminiscent of the infrequently recognized
autosomal dominant Schilbach-Rott syndrome.

Gene expression profiling of pulmonary fibrosis identifies Twist1 as an
antiapoptotic molecular "rectifier" of growth factor signaling.

Surgeons, New York, New York, USA.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and typically fatal lung
disease. To gain insight into IPF pathogenesis, we performed gene expression
profiling of IPF lungs. Twist1, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, was found among
the most consistently and highly up-regulated genes and was expressed in nuclei
of type II epithelial cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts in IPF lungs. We
studied the function of Twist1 in fibroblasts further, because they are the major
effector cells in this disease and persist despite an ambient proapoptotic
environment. Twist1 was induced by the profibrotic growth factors (GFs) basic
fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and epidermal growth
factor in primary rat lung fibroblasts (RLFs). Suppression of Twist1 expression
resulted in decreased RLF accumulation due to increased apoptosis, whereas Twist1
overexpression protected RLFs against several apoptotic stimuli. Addition of
platelet-derived growth factor in combination with other GFs led to an increase
in proliferation. When Twist1 was depleted, GFs continued to act as mitogens but 
caused a marked increase in cell death. The increase in apoptosis under basal or 
growth factor-stimulated conditions was partly mediated by up-regulation of the
proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bim and PUMA. These findings indicate that
Twist1 promotes survival and accumulation of fibroblasts by shaping their
responsiveness to growth factor stimulation. We propose that Twist1 represents
one of the factors that promotes pathogenic accumulation of fibroblasts in
fibrotic lung disease.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is one of the most common craniosynostosis syndromes. It
is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder with variable expression that is
caused by germline mutations in the TWIST1 gene or more rarely in the FGFR2 or
FGFR3 genes. We have previously reported that patients with Saethre-Chotzen
syndrome have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Here we have
analysed a cohort of 26 women with BRCA1/2-negative hereditary breast cancer to
study whether a proportion of these families might have mutations in
Saethre-Chotzen-associated genes. DNA sequence analysis of TWIST1 showed no
pathogenic mutations in the coding sequence in any of the 26 patients. MLPA
(multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification)-analysis also showed no
alterations in copy numbers in any of the craniofacial disorder genes MSX2, ALX4,
RUNX2, EFNB1, TWIST1, FGFR1, FGFR2,FGFR3, or FGFR4. Taken together, our findings 
indicate that mutations in Saethre-Chotzen-associated genes are uncommon or
absent in BRCA1/2-negative patients with hereditary breast cancer.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (acrocephalosyndactyly type III) is a craniosynostosis
syndrome inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Although similar to the other
craniosynostosis syndromes in its clinical presentation, this syndrome is caused 
by a mutation in the TWIST1 gene. The TWIST1 gene product is a transcription
factor containing a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain important in the
development of the head and limbs. Clinical features of this syndrome include
unilateral or bilateral coronal synostosis, ptosis, low-set ears, hearing loss,
hypertelorism, maxillary hypoplasia, deviated nasal septum, broad great toes,
clinodactyly, and syndactyly. We report a young girl with clinical features of
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome who has a previously undescribed sequence variant in the
TWIST1 gene, corresponding to p.R191M. The location of the altered amino acid in 
the Twist-box of TWIST1, the high conservation of this amino acid between
different species, and the phenotype of the child all support a pathogenic role
for this novel TWIST1 sequence alteration.

Twist: a regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in lung fibrosis.

Stecenko AA, Mora AL.

Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of
America.

BACKGROUND: Several studies have implicated viral infection as an important
factor in the pathogenesis of IPF and related fibrotic lung disorders. Viruses
are thought to cause epithelial cell injury and promote epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), a process whereby differentiated epithelial cells undergo
transition to a mesenchymal phenotype, and considered a source of fibroblasts in 
the setting of lung injury. We have demonstrated an association between the
epithelial injury caused by chronic herpes virus infection with the murine
gamma-herpes virus, MHV68, and lung fibrosis. We hypothesize that EMT in this
model of virus-induced pulmonary fibrosis is driven by the expression of the
transcription factor Twist.
METHODS/FINDINGS: In vitro MHV68 infection of murine lung epithelial cells
induced expression of Twist, and mesenchymal markers. Stable overexpression of
Twist promoted EMT in MLE15 lung epithelial cells. Transient knockdown expression
of Twist resulted in preservation of epithelial phenotype after in vitro MHV68
infection. In concordance, high expression of Twist was found in lung epithelial 
cells of MHV68 infected mice, but not in mock infected mice. Alveolar epithelial 
cells from lung tissue of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients were
strongly positive for Twist. These cells demonstrated features of EMT with low
expression of E-cadherin and upregulation of the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin.
Finally, IPF tissue with high Twist protein levels was also positive for the
herpesvirus, EBV.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that Twist contributes to EMT in the model 
of virus-induced pulmonary fibrosis. We speculate that in some IPF cases,
gamma-herpes virus infection with EBV might be a source of injury precipitating
EMT through the expression of Twist.

University, 3-1-1, Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.

BACKGROUND: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key event in cancer
progression. The expression of EMT-related factors in non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) and their impact on clinicopathological variables was examined.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 137 NSCLC patients who underwent surgical
resections were investigated. The expression of Twist, Snail, smad-interacting
protein 1 (Sip1), E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin and beta-catenin was detected 
by immunohistochemical analyses.
RESULTS: The expression of Sip1 was associated with the reduced expression of
E-cadherin (p=0.04) and the positive expression of N-cadherin (p=0.04). There was
no association between the expression of Twist nor Snail and the epithelial or
mesenchymal markers. The expression of Sip1 correlated with advanced T status
(p=0.01), tumor diameter (p=0.01) and advanced stage (p=0.01). Furthermore, the
expression of Sip1 was associated with poor postoperative overall survival
(p=0.02).
CONCLUSION: The expression of Sip1 is significantly associated with tumor growth 
and poor prognoses in NSCLC and EMT might be activated via Sip1 expression and
result in accelerated tumor growth and poor survival in NSCLC.

In this study, a comparative quantitative methylation profiling of inflammatory
breast cancer (IBC) and non-IBC was set up for the identification of
tumor-specific methylation patterns. Methylation ratios of six genes (DAPK,
TWIST, HIN-1, RASSF1A, RARbeta2 and APC) were measured in benign breast tissues
(n = 9) and in tumor samples from non-IBC (n = 81) and IBC (n = 19) patients
using quantitative methylation-specific PCR. Median methylation ratios observed
in breast cancer (n = 100) were significantly higher than those observed in
benign breast tissues for five of six genes (TWIST, HIN-1, RASSF1A, RARbeta2 and 
APC). Only one of the individual genes studied, RARbeta2, showed differential
methylation ratios in IBC and non-IBC (p = 0.016). Using the maximal methylation 
ratio observed in benign breast tissue as a threshold, the methylation frequency 
of two genes, RARbeta2 and APC, was significantly increased in IBC (n = 19) when 
compared to non-IBC (n = 81): 53 vs. 23% for RARbeta2 (p = 0.012) and 84 vs. 54% 
for APC (p = 0.017). Using hierarchical clustering, methylation patterns could
not classify breast cancers according to their phenotype. The finding of
differential frequencies of methylation in IBC and non-IBC for two out of six
genes suggests that gene-specific patterns of methylation could provide a basis
for molecular classification of IBC. Testing for additional genes could help to
define the IBC phenotype based on patterns of aberrant gene promoter methylation.

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is critical for induction of
invasiveness and metastasis of human cancers. In this study we investigated the
expression profiles of the EMT markers, the relationship between EMT markers and 
patient/tumor/viral factors, and the interplay between major EMT regulators in
human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Reduced E-cadherin and nonmembranous
beta-catenin expression, the hallmarks of EMT, were shown in 60.2% and 51.5% of
primary HCC samples, respectively. Overexpression of Snail, Twist, or Slug, the
major regulators of EMT, was identified in 56.9%, 43.1%, and 51.4% of primary
HCCs, respectively. Statistical analysis determined that Snail and Twist, but not
Slug, are major EMT inducers in HCC: overexpression of Snail and/or Twist
correlated with down-regulation of E-cadherin, nonmembranous expression of
beta-catenin, and a worse prognosis. In contrast, there were no such significant 
differences in samples that overexpressed Slug. Coexpression of Snail and Twist
correlated with the worst prognosis of HCC. Hepatitis C-associated HCC was
significantly correlated with Twist overexpression. HCC cell lines with increased
Snail and Twist expression (e.g., Mahlavu) exhibited a greater capacity for
invasiveness/metastasis than cells with low endogenous Twist/Snail expression
(e.g., Huh-7). Overexpression of Snail or/and Twist in Huh-7 induced EMT and
invasiveness/metastasis, whereas knockdown of Twist or Snail in Mahlavu reversed 
EMT and inhibited invasiveness/metastasis. Twist and Snail were independently
regulated, but exerted an additive inhibitory effect to suppress E-cadherin
transcription.CONCLUSION: Our study provides a comprehensive profile of EMT
markers in HCC, and the independent and collaborative effects of Snail and Twist 
on HCC metastasis were confirmed through different assays.

The transcription factor Twist plays a key role in cancer metastasis. The present
study aimed at investigating clinical Twist expression in patients with
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in order to correlate the Twist levels 
with the patients' survival rates and their other clinical parameters.
Immunohistochemical staining using polyclonal Twist antibody was performed on
paraffin embedded specimens of 112 ESCC patients and non-neoplastic esophageal
epithelium used as a control. The overall staining intensity was analyzed along
with clinicopathologic data and prognosis of ESCC. Twist expression was
significantly higher in ESCC than in non-neoplastic oesophageal epithelium (P <
0.001). The Twist expression directly correlated with distant metastasis after
esophagectomy (P = 0.001). Kaplan-Meier estimate in conjunction with the log-rank
test revealed an inverse proportion relationship between postoperative survival
rates of the patients and their Twist expression levels (log-rank, P < 0.001). In
addition, Cox mono-variate analysis revealed that T/N classification, pTNM stage,
distant metastasis and Twist expression were significantly correlated with
mortality risk of patients after operation (P < 0.05). By Cox multi-variate
analysis, Twist expression (risk ratio = 2.394; P < 0.001) and N classification
were identified as the independent prognostic factors of patient survival. In
conclusion, upregulated Twist expression in the primary ESCC significantly
correlates with the high risk of subsequent development of distant metastasis and
low postoperative survival rates; the latter was not significantly correlated
with patients' age, gender, tumor location and differentiation. Twist may serve
as an independent prognostic marker for predicting development of distant
metastasis in ESCC patients and their survival.

University, Harbin, China.

TWIST, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, has been recently reported 
to play an important role in tumorigenesis of human cancer through converting the
early stage tumors into invasive malignancies. Upregulation of TWIST is often
found in cancer patients, especially those with shorter survival period and poor 
response to chemotherapy. Here we studied the functions of TWIST on regulating
migration rate, apoptosis, and gene expression in gastric cancer cells. TWIST
expression is elevated in MGC-803 and HGC-27 cells that exhibit high invasive
potential; whereas it is reduced in BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells that possess
relatively low invasive content. To evaluate functional consequences of TWIST
induction, we examined the effect of TWIST on cell migration and apoptosis.
Overexpression of TWIST in BGC-823 cells resulted in increased migration content 
and decreased sensitivity to the arsenic oxide-induced cell death. Moreover,
small interference RNA-mediated TWIST ablation in MGC-803 and HGC-27 cells showed
suppressed migration ability, increased induction of apoptosis in response to
arsenic oxide, and elevated cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, we found a negative
correlation between the TWIST level and p53 level, probably due to
transcriptional regulation. Our results have identified TWIST as a critical
regulator of gastric cancer cell proliferation and migration, suggesting a
potential therapeutic approach to inhibit the growth and metastasis of gastric
cancer through inactivation of TWIST.

There are few successful therapies for castration-resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC). Recently, CRPC has been thought to result from augmented
androgen/androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway, for most of which AR
overexpression has been observed. In this study, Twist1, a member of basic
helix-loop-helix transcription factors as well as AR was upregulated in response 
to hydrogen peroxide, and the response to which was abolished by an addition of
N-acetyl-L-cysteine and Twist1 knockdown. In addition, castration-resistant LNCaP
derivatives and hydrogen peroxide-resistant LNCaP derivatives exhibited a similar
phenotype to each other. Then, both castration and AR knockdown increased
intracellular reactive oxygen species level. Moreover, Twist1 was shown to
regulate AR expression through binding to E-boxes in AR promoter region.
Silencing of Twist1 suppressed cell growth of AR-expressing LNCaP cells as well
as castration-resistant LNCaP derivatives by inducing cell-cycle arrest at G1
phase and cellular apoptosis. These findings indicated that castration-induced
oxidative stress may promote AR overexpression through Twist1 overexpression,
which could result in a gain of castration resistance. Modulation of
castration-induced oxidative stress or Twist1/AR signaling might be a useful
strategy for developing a novel therapeutics in prostate cancer, even in CRPC,
which remains dependent on AR signaling by overexpressing AR.

Prognostic significance of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, TWIST1 and Snail
expression in resectable non-small cell lung cancer.

Hung JJ(1), Yang MH, Hsu HS, Hsu WH, Liu JS, Wu KJ.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: Metastasis is the most common cause of disease failure and mortality 
for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after surgical resection. Snail and TWIST1
are epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulators which induce metastasis.
Intratumoral hypoxia followed by stabilisation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha
(HIF-1alpha) promotes metastasis through regulation of certain EMT regulators.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of HIF-1alpha, TWIST1 
and Snail expression in patients with resectable NSCLC.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 87 patients with resectable NSCLC from
Taipei Veterans General Hospital between 2003 and 2004 was performed using
immunohistochemistry to analyse HIF-1alpha, TWIST1 and Snail expression. The
association between HIF-1alpha, TWIST1 and Snail expression and patients' overall
and recurrence-free survivals was investigated.
RESULTS: Overexpression of HIF-1alpha, TWIST1 or Snail was shown in 32.2%, 36.8% 
and 55.2% of primary tumours, respectively. Overexpression of HIF-1alpha, TWIST1 
or Snail in primary NSCLCs was associated with a shorter overall survival (p =
0.005, p = 0.026, p = 0.009, respectively), and overexpression of HIF-1alpha was 
associated with a shorter recurrence-free survival (p = 0.016). We categorised
the patients into four groups according to the positivity of
HIF-1alpha/TWIST1/Snail to investigate the accumulated effects of these markers
on survival. Co-expression of more than two markers was an independent prognostic
indicator for both recurrence-free survival and overall survival (p = 0.004 and
p<0.001, respectively, by multivariate Cox proportional hazards model).
CONCLUSIONS: Co-expression of more than two markers from HIF-1alpha, TWIST1 and
Snail is a significant prognostic predictor in patients with NSCLC.

Scalp fibroblasts have a shared expression profile in monogenic craniosynostosis.

Bochukova EG(1), Soneji S, Wall SA, Wilkie AO.

Author information: 
(1)Clinical Genetics Group, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine,
University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK.

BACKGROUND: Craniosynostosis can be caused by both genetic and environmental
factors, the relative contributions of which vary between patients. Genetic
testing identifies a pathogenic mutation or chromosomal abnormality in ~ 21% of
cases, but it is likely that further causative mutations remain to be discovered.
OBJECTIVE: To identify a shared signature of genetically determined
craniosynostosis by comparing the expression patterns in three monogenic
syndromes with a control group of patients with non-syndromic sagittal
synostosis.
METHODS: Fibroblasts from 10 individuals each with Apert syndrome (FGFR2
substitution S252W), Muenke syndrome (FGFR3 substitution P250R), Saethre-Chotzen 
syndrome (various mutations in TWIST1) and non-syndromic sagittal synostosis (no 
mutation detected) were cultured. The relative expression of ~ 47,000 transcripts
was quantified on Affymetrix arrays.
RESULTS: 435, 45 and 46 transcripts were identified in the Apert, Muenke and
Saethre-Chotzen groups, respectively, that differed significantly from the
controls. Forty-six of these transcripts were shared between two or more
syndromes and, in all but one instance, showed the same direction of altered
expression level compared with controls. Pathway analysis showed
over-representation of the shared transcripts in core modules involving
cell-to-cell communication and signal transduction. Individual samples from the
Apert syndrome cases could be reliably distinguished from non-syndromic samples
based on the gene expression profile, but this was not possible for samples from 
patients with Muenke and Saethre-Chotzen syndromes.
CONCLUSIONS: Common modules of altered gene expression shared by genetically
distinct forms of craniosynostosis were identified. Although the expression
profiles cannot currently be used to classify individual patients, this may be
overcome by using more sensitive assays and sampling additional tissues.

Bone morphogenetic protein 7 induces mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in
melanoma cells, leading to inhibition of metastasis.

Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 7 counteracts physiological
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a process that is indicative of epithelial 
plasticity in developmental stages. Because epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition 
and its reversed process mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) are also
involved in cancer progression, we investigated whether BMP7 plays a role in
WM-266-4 melanoma cell growth and metastasis. An MTT assay was conducted in
WM-266-4 and HEK293T cell lines to show the cell growth inhibition ability of
BMP7 and cisplatin. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was used to determine MET in
morphologically changed BMP7-treated melanoma cells. MET-induced cells expressed 
less a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (TWIST) in western blot
analysis, and we confirm that BMP receptor (Alk2) siRNA transduction could
restore TWIST protein expression via blocking of Smad 1, 5 and 8 signaling.
Matrigel invasion and cell migration assays were done to investigate the
BMP7-induced metastasis inhibition ability. BMP7 treatment only slightly reduced 
cell growth rate, but induced apparent MET. BMP7 also reduced the invasion and
migration ability. Furthermore, BMP7 reduced the resistance of WM-266-4 cells to 
cisplatin. Collectively, our findings indicate that the metastatis inhibition
ability of BMP7 is involved in MET, and that BMP7 could be used as a potential
metastasis inhibitor in human melanoma cells.

Metastasis as a complex process involves loss of adhesion, migration, invasion
and proliferation of cancer cells. Sulforaphane (SFN) is one of naturally
occurring cancer chemopreventive isothiocyanates found in cruciferous vegetables,
consumption of which has been associated with reduced risk of cancer. In this
study, we describe effect of SFN on various aspects determining invasive behavior
of MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells. We studied modulation of molecules
associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxic marker CA IX 
and mitochondrially located peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) using flow
cytometry, gene expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP1, 3, 7, 9, 14,
transcription factors POU5F1 and Twist1 mRNA by RT PCR, and cytokine production
by multiplex bead assay. SFN downregulated PBR and vimentin expression in a dose 
dependent manner, but significantly affected neither HIF-1alpha, nor CA IX
protein expression, nor VEGF and GLUT1 mRNA levels. Among studied MMPs, MMP7 and 
MMP14 mRNA were downregulated while no apparent effect on MMP1, MMP3 and MMP9 was
observed. Further, we found significant down regulation of Twist1 and POU5F1,
transcription factors that mediate EMT and the self-renewal of undifferentiated
embryonic stem cells. SFN reduced also the production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, immunomodulating cytokine IL-4
and growth factors involved in angiogenesis PDGF and VEGF. Our study shows that
SFN efficacy is associated with the reversal of several biological
characteristics connected with EMT or implicated in the matrix degradation and
extracellular proteolysis, as well as with reduced production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines and pro-angiogenic growth factors in MDA-MB-231 cells.

Author information: 
(1)State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, West China College of Stomatology,
Sichuan University, Sichuan, People's Republic of China.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the pattern of Twist
expression in a series of ameloblastomas, and to study the possible role of Twist
in the bone destruction and local invasiveness of ameloblastoma variants.
STUDY DESIGN: Immunohistochemical study was performed for Twist protein in 53
ameloblastomas (32 solid/multicystic [SA] and 21 unicystic [UA]).
RESULTS: The salient finding was that expression of Twist was related to the
histological subtype of tumors, as there was a higher expression in SA (14/32,
43.75%) as compared to UA (4/21, 19.05%) (P < .05). Both nuclei and cytoplasm
positivities were detected in positive cases, whereas cytoplasmic staining was
diffused and predominant. Cases rich in stromal cells showed a higher percentage 
of positive cells than those with less stroma.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Twist expression might be associated with
invasion in ameloblastoma variants, and stromal cells might play a regulatory
role during tumor development.

BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests that DNA methylation markers could
serve as sensitive and specific cancer biomarkers.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a panel of methylated genes would have the
potential to identify primary bladder cancer (BCa) in voided urine samples.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A pharmacologic unmasking reexpression
analysis in BCa cell lines was initially undertaken to unveil candidate
methylated genes, which were then evaluated in methylation-specific polymerase
chain reaction (MSP) assays performed on DNA extracted from noncancerous and
cancerous bladder tissues. The most frequently methylated genes in cancerous
tissues, with 100% specificity, were retained for subsequent MSP analysis in DNA 
extracted from urine samples to build and validate a panel of potential
methylated gene markers. Urine samples were prospectively collected at three
urologic centres from patients with histologically proven BCa and processed for
use in real-time MSP and cytologic analysis. Patients with nonmalignant urologic 
disorders were included as controls.
MEASUREMENTS: A urine sample was classified as valid when > or = 10 copies of the
gene encoding ß-actin were measured in the urine sediment genomic DNA.
Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the MSP and cytology tests
were assessed and compared.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: MSP assays performed on 466 of the 496 (94%) valid urine
samples identified two genes, TWIST1 and NID2, that were frequently methylated in
urine samples collected from BCa patients, including those with early-stage and
low-grade disease. The sensitivity of this two-gene panel (90%) was significantly
better than that of cytology (48%), with comparable specificity (93% and 96%,
respectively). The positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the
two-gene panel was 86% and 95%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Detection of the methylated TWIST1 and NID2 genes in urine sediments
using MSP provides a highly (> or = 90%) sensitive and specific, noninvasive
approach for detecting primary BCa.

OBJECTIVE: Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome (SCS) is an autosomal dominant disorder with 
widespread phenotypic variability. Cardinal features include coronal synostosis, 
blepharoptosis, and limb abnormalities. Cleft palate can also occur, but there
are few reports on its frequency. This study was undertaken to determine the
prevalence of palatal anomalies in this population.
DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 51 patients with SCS seen at
Children's Hospital Boston over the past 30 years. Palatal findings in our
patients were compared with those in the literature. To illustrate the phenotypic
variability in SCS, we describe an unusual infant who presented for evaluation of
cleft palate and blepharoptosis. Her father had only blepharoptosis; this was the
clue to the diagnosis, which was confirmed by finding a deletion in the TWIST
gene.
RESULTS: In our patients, high-arched palate was noted in 43%, bifid uvula in
10%, and cleft palate in 6%. These figures differed slightly from the combined
percentages in published reports: 24% with high-arched palate, 2% with bifid
uvula, and 5% with cleft palate.
CONCLUSIONS: Palatal anomalies are relatively common in SCS. This entity should
be considered in the differential diagnosis of a child with cleft palate,
particularly in the presence of blepharoptosis, nasal deviation, and limb
abnormalities in the patient or in family members.

BACKGROUND: Twist, a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix class, is
reported to regulate cancer metastasis. It is known to induce
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this study, we evaluated the
expression of twist and its effect on cell migration in hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC).
METHODS: We examined twist expression using immunohistochemistry in 20 tissue
samples of hepatocellular carcinoma, and assessed twist expression in HCC cell
lines by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Ectopic twist expression was created
by introducing a twist construct in the twist-negative HCC cell lines. Endogenous
twist expression was blocked by twist siRNA in the twist-positive HCC cell lines.
We studied EMT related markers, E-cadherin, Vimentin, and N-cadherin by Western
blot analysis. Cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay, and cell migration
was measured by in vitro wound healing assay. We used immunofluorescent vinculin 
staining to visualize focal adhesion.
RESULTS: We detected strong and intermediate twist expression in 7 of 20 tumor
samples, and no significant twist expression was found in the tumor-free
resection margins. In addition, we detected twist expression in HLE, HLF, and
SK-Hep1 cells, but not in PLC/RPF/5, HepG2, and Huh7 cells. Ectopic
twist-expressing cells demonstrated enhanced cell motility, but twist expression 
did not affect cell proliferation. Twist expression induced
epithelial-mesenchymal transition together with related morphologic changes.
Focal adhesion contact was reduced significantly in ectopic twist-expressing
cells. Twist-siRNA-treated HLE, HLF, and SK-Hep1 cells demonstrated a reduction
in cell migration by 50, 40 and 18%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Twist induces migratory effect on hepatocellular carcinoma by causing
epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

TWIST family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors mediate human
mesenchymal stem cell growth and commitment.

Veterinary Science/Hanson Institute/ CSCR, University of Adelaide, SA, Australia.

The TWIST family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, Twist-1 and
Dermo-1 are known mediators of mesodermal tissue development and contribute to
correct patterning of the skeleton. In this study, we demonstrate that freshly
purified human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSC) express
high levels of Twist-1 and Dermo-1 which are downregulated following ex vivo
expansion. Enforced expression of Twist-1 or Dermo-1 in human MSC cultures
increased expression of the MSC marker, STRO-1, and the early osteogenic
transcription factors, Runx2 and Msx2. Conversely, overexpression of Twist-1 and 
Dermo-1 was associated with a decrease in the gene expression of
osteoblast-associated markers, bone morphogenic protein-2, bone sialoprotein,
osteopontin, alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin. High expressing Twist-1 or
Dermo-1 MSC lines exhibited an enhanced proliferative potential of approximately 
2.5-fold compared with control MSC populations that were associated with elevated
levels of Id-1 and Id-2 gene expression. Functional studies demonstrated that
high expressing Twist-1 and Dermo-1 MSC displayed a decreased capacity for
osteo/chondrogenic differentiation and an enhanced capacity to undergo
adipogenesis. These findings implicate the TWIST gene family members as potential
mediators of MSC self-renewal and lineage commitment in postnatal skeletal
tissues by exerting their effects on genes involved in the early stages of bone
development.

A novel polymorphism (+1871A>G) in the 3' flanking region and haplotypes were
significantly associated with reduced osteoporosis risk and enhanced bone mineral
density (BMD). These results suggest that TWIST1 may be a useful genetic marker
for osteoporosis. Our results provide preliminary evidence supporting an
association of TWIST1 with osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.INTRODUCTION:
TWIST1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, has been implicated
in cell lineage determination and differentiation.
METHODS: To address the genetic variations in the TWIST1 gene associated with
osteoporosis, we investigated the potential involvement of three TWIST1
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in osteoporosis in 729 postmenopausal
women. BMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.
RESULTS: A novel polymorphism in the 3' flanking region (+1871A>G) was
significantly associated with osteoporosis risk (p = 0.007-0.008) and also in
multiple comparison (p = 0.02). Consistent with these results, haplotype analysis
showed that Block1_ht2 had protective effects in the dominant and additive model 
(p = 0.006-0.007). Specifically, the +1871A>G polymorphism was overdominantly
associated with higher BMD values of the femoral neck (p = 0.039).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that TWIST1 may be a useful genetic marker for 
osteoporosis and may have a role on bone metabolism in humans. Our results
provide preliminary evidence supporting an association of TWIST1 with
osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

INTRODUCTION: The persistence of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in breast cancer
patients might be associated with stem cell like tumor cells which have been
suggested to be the active source of metastatic spread in primary tumors.
Furthermore, these cells also may undergo phenotypic changes, known as
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which allows them to travel to the site 
of metastasis formation without getting affected by conventional treatment. Here 
we evaluated 226 blood samples of 39 metastatic breast cancer patients during a
follow-up of palliative chemo-, antibody - or hormonal therapy for the expression
of the stem cell marker ALDH1 and markers for EMT and correlated these findings
with the presence of CTC and response to therapy.
METHODS: 2 x 5 ml blood was analyzed for CTC with the AdnaTest BreastCancer
(AdnaGen AG) for the detection of EpCAM, MUC-1 and HER2 transcripts. The
recovered c-DNA was additionally multiplex tested for three EMT markers [Twist1, 
Akt2, PI3Kalpha] and separately for the tumor stem-cell markers ALDH1. The
identification of EMT markers was considered positive if at least one marker was 
detected in the sample.
RESULTS: 97% of 30 healthy donor samples investigated were negative for EMT and
95% for ALDH1 transcripts. CTC were detected in 69/226 (31%) cancer samples. In
the CTC (+) group, 62% were positive for at least one of the EMT markers and 69% 
for ALDH1, respectively. In the CTC (-) group the percentages were 7% and 14%,
respectively. In non-responders, EMT and ALDH1 expression was found in 62% and
44% of patients, in responders the rates were 10% and 5%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that a major proportion of CTC of metastatic
breast cancer patients shows EMT and tumor stem cell characteristics. Further
studies are needed to prove whether these markers might serve as an indicator for
therapy resistant tumor cell populations and, therefore, an inferior prognosis.

Breast tumor interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels increase with tumor grade, and elevated 
serum IL-6 correlates with poor breast cancer patient survival.
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes such as impaired E-cadherin
expression or aberrant Vimentin induction are associated with enhanced metastasis
and unfavorable clinical outcome in breast cancer. Despite this fact, few tumor
microenvironment-derived extracellular signaling factors capable of provoking
such a phenotypic transition have been identified. In this study, we showed that 
IL-6 promoted E-cadherin repression among a panel of estrogen
receptor-alpha-positive human breast cancer cells. Furthermore, ectopic stable
IL-6 expressing MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7(IL-6)) exhibited an EMT 
phenotype characterized by impaired E-cadherin expression and induction of
Vimentin, N-cadherin, Snail and Twist. MCF-7(IL-6) cells formed xenograft tumors 
that displayed loss of E-cadherin, robust Vimentin induction, increased
proliferative indices, advanced tumor grade and undifferentiated histology.
Finally, we showed aberrant IL-6 production and STAT3 activation in MCF-7 cells
that constitutively express Twist, a metastatic regulator and direct
transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin. To our knowledge, this is the first
study that shows IL-6 as an inducer of an EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells
and implicates its potential to promote breast cancer metastasis.

Four members of the twist gene family (twist1a, 1b, 2, and 3) are found in the
zebrafish, and they are thought to have arisen through three rounds of gene
duplication, two of which occurred prior to the tetrapod-fish split. Phylogenetic
analysis groups most of the vertebrate Twist1 peptides into clade I, except for
the Twist1b proteins of the acanthopterygian fish (medaka, pufferfish,
stickleback), which clustered within clade III. Paralogies and orthologies among 
the zebrafish, medaka, and human twist genes were determined using comparative
synteny analysis of the chromosomal regions flanking these genes. Comparative
nucleotide substitution analyses also revealed a faster rate of nucleotide
mutation/substitution in the acanthopterygian twist1b compared to the zebrafish
twist1b, thus accounting for their anomalous phylogenetic clustering. We also
observed minimal expression overlap among the four twist genes, suggesting that
despite their significant peptide similarity, their regulatory controls have
diverged considerably, with minimal functional redundancy between them.

The establishment of metastasis depends on the ability of cancer cells to acquire
a migratory phenotype combined with their capacity to recreate a secondary tumor 
in a distant tissue. In epithelial cancers, such as those of the breast, the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with basal-like breast
cancers, generates cells with stem-like properties, and enables cancer cell
dissemination and metastasis. However, the molecular mechanism(s) that connects
stem cell-like characteristics with EMT has yet to be defined. Using an
orthotopic model of human breast cancer metastasis to lung, we identified a poor 
prognosis gene signature, in which several components of the wnt signaling
pathway were overexpressed in early lung metastases. The wnt genes identified in 
this signature were strongly associated with human basal-like breast cancers. We 
found that inhibiting wnt signaling through LRP6 reduced the capacity of cancer
cells to self-renew and seed tumors in vivo. Furthermore, inhibition of wnt
signaling resulted in the reexpression of breast epithelial differentiation
markers and repression of EMT transcription factors SLUG and TWIST. Collectively,
these results provide a molecular link between self-renewal, EMT, and metastasis 
in basal-like breast cancers.

Changes in the expression of E-cadherin have been reported to be important in the
tumorigenesis and progression of epithelial ovarian carcinoma. To further examine
the mechanisms regulating E-cadherin expression in ovarian tumorigenesis, we
investigated the immunohistochemical expression of transcriptional repressors for
E-cadherin, such as Snail, Slug, SIP1, and Twist, in the ovarian surface
epithelium (OSE) and 95 cases of epithelial ovarian tumors. OSE cells were
negative for SIP1 and Slug, whereas weak expression of Snail and Twist was
observed in 8 (73%) and 3 (27%) cases, respectively. Of 95 ovarian tumors, the
expression of Snail, Slug, SIP1, and Twist increased stepwise in benign,
borderline, and malignant tumors. Among them, the expression of Snail showed
significantly inverse correlation with that of E-cadherin. Regarding the FIGO
stage classification, the expressions of Snail and Twist were significantly
increased in advanced cases. The prognosis of ovarian carcinoma patients positive
for Snail expression was poorer than that of negative patients. Our results
indicate that the expression of E-cadherin transcriptional repressors increased
with malignancy in ovarian epithelial neoplasms and that the expression of
E-cadherin and its negative regulators is altered during ovarian cancer
development and peritoneal dissemination.

WNT/beta-catenin pathway activation in Wilms tumors: a unifying mechanism with
multiple entries?

Based on characterization of both genomic and expression status of WT1 and CTNNB1
(beta-catenin) in a series of 60 Wilms tumor samples, combined with genome-wide
expression profiling of these tumors, normal mature and fetal kidney controls, we
show that WT1/beta-catenin expression was a better classifier than WT1/CTNNB1
mutations. We present molecular data supporting that the WNT pathway is involved 
in both tumor classes, with and without WT1/beta-catenin alterations. In the
tumor class with WT1/beta-catenin alterations, we identified overexpression of 14
previously unreported WNT target genes, including TWIST1. We show that the TWIST1
protein was specifically expressed in these tumors, where staining was restricted
to the stromal, nuclear beta-catenin positive, component. By comparing the state 
of the WNT pathway in tumors without WT1/beta-catenin alterations and fetal
kidneys we provide evidence that suggests that these tumors have a heightened
level of pathway activation. We characterized mutations of the WNT pathway
regulator gene WTX in 16% of this tumor class. Moreover, genome-transcriptome
correlation analysis allowed us to identify three other WNT pathway regulator
genes that could participate in the activation of the WNT pathway: BCL9 (1p36.2),
CTNNBIP1 (1p36.2), and CBY1 (22q13.1). These genes thus represent new potential
important actors in WT tumorigenesis.

TWIST1 is involved in tumor invasion and metastasis by promoting
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. However, the molecular target of TWIST1
involving this mechanism is poorly understood. To identify the TWIST1-regulated
genes, we established the Saos-2 cells stably expressing TWIST1 gene by
transfecting TWIST1 cDNA into the cells and performed a differential display
approach by using annealing control primers. Here, we report that one of the
genes that were down-regulated in TWIST1 expressing cells is predicted to be
TIMP1. TIMP1 has been reported as the naturally occurring specific inhibitor of
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Overexpression of TWIST1 gene suppressed the
expression of TIMP1 mRNA but had no effect on TIMP2 and MMP-2 expression, as
determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. We showed that TWIST1 was up-regulated in
SCCBHY cells, which have a strong capacity of invasion into mandibular bone
compared with SCCHN cells. Our present results suggest that TWIST1 is involved in
tumor invasion by regulating the expression of TIMP1.

Snail2 cooperates with Snail1 in the repression of vitamin D receptor in colon
cancer.

Vitamin D receptor (VDR) mediates the antitumoral action of the active vitamin D 
metabolite 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)). VDR expression is
lost during colon cancer progression causing unresponsiveness to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) 
and its analogs. Previously, Snail1, an inducer of epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), was reported to inhibit VDR expression. Here, we show that
Snail2/Slug, but not other EMT inducers such as Zeb1, Zeb2, E47 or Twist1,
represses VDR gene promoter. Moreover, Snail2 and Snail1 show additive repressing
effect on VDR promoter. Snail2 inhibits VDR RNA and protein and blocks the
induction of E-cadherin and an adhesive phenotype by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). Snail2
reduces the ligand-induced VDR transcriptional activation of a consensus response
element and of the CYP24 promoter. Concordantly, Snail2 inhibits the induction of
CYP24 RNA and p21(CIP1), filamin A and vinculin proteins and the repression of
c-MYC by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). Additionally, Snail2 abrogates beta-catenin nuclear
export and the antagonism of the transcriptional activity of beta-catenin-T-cell 
factor complexes by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). SNAI2 expression is upregulated in 58% of
colorectal tumors and correlates inversely with that of VDR. However, VDR
downregulation is higher in tumors coexpressing SNAI2 and SNAI1 than in those
expressing only one of these genes. Together, these data indicate that Snail2 and
Snail1 cooperate for VDR repression in colon cancer.

Studies have suggested involvement of interleukin 17 (IL-17) in autoimmune
diseases, although its effect on B cell biology has not been clearly established.
Here we demonstrate that IL-17 alone or in combination with B cell-activating
factor controlled the survival and proliferation of human B cells and their
differentiation into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. This effect was mediated
mainly through the nuclear factor-kappaB-regulated transcription factor Twist-1. 
In support of the relevance of our observations and the potential involvement of 
IL-17 in B cell biology, we found that the serum of patients with systemic lupus 
erythematosus had higher concentrations of IL-17 than did the serum of healthy
people and that IL-17 abundance correlated with the disease severity of systemic 
lupus erythematosus.

BACKGROUND: Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a syndromic craniosynostosis defined by a
genetic mutation affecting the TWIST1 gene on chromosome 7p21. It is typically
associated with unicoronal or bicoronal synostosis, eyelid ptosis, dysmorphic
external ears, and other variable facial and limb abnormalities. Surgical
management of the craniosynostosis addresses the calvarial deformity and may
relieve or reduce the risk of intracranial hypertension. The aim of this study
was to assess surgical intervention, with particular consideration of the
reoperation rate for intracranial hypertension, in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome
patients.
METHODS: A retrospective case note analysis was performed on all patients with a 
confirmed TWIST1 gene abnormality who attended the Oxford Craniofacial Unit over 
a 15-year period. Each patient's mutation and clinical features were recorded.
Surgical intervention and sequelae were examined in greater detail.
RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with genetically confirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome
were identified. All had craniosynostosis (bicoronal, 76 percent; unicoronal, 18 
percent; bicoronal and sagittal, 6 percent), and the majority had eyelid ptosis, 
low frontal hairline, and external ear anomalies. Thirty-one patients had
received surgical intervention. Nine of 26 patients (35 percent) with at least 12
months of follow-up after primary intervention and eight of 19 patients (42
percent) with at least 5 years of follow-up developed intracranial hypertension
necessitating secondary calvarial surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite standard surgical intervention, patients with
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome have a high rate (35 to 42 percent) of recurrent
intracranial hypertension necessitating further surgical expansion. All patients 
with either bicoronal synostosis or unicoronal synostosis with syndromic features
should be screened for TWIST1 mutations, as this confers a greater risk than
nonsyndromic synostosis of the same sutures. Regular follow-up throughout the
childhood years is essential.

PURPOSE: In a pilot study of women with pathologic nipple discharge (PND)
undergoing ductoscopy, we tested quantitative assessment of gene promoter
hypermethylation using quantitative multiplex methylation-specific PCR (QM-MSP)
to enhance detection of duct carcinoma in situ (DCIS).
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Women with PND underwent ductoscopy; ducts with significant 
lesions were surgically resected (36 ducts in 33 women) and those with minimal
findings were not (28 ducts in 16 women). QM-MSP was done on ductoscopy cell
samples. Results were compared with cytology and tissue histology.
RESULTS: Cells from ducts with significant lesions on ductoscopy had
significantly higher levels of methylation than those with minimal findings.
Furthermore, cells from ducts with DCIS displayed higher levels of methylation
than those with benign lesions such as papilloma (P = 0.006); or ducts with
minimal findings on ductoscopy (P = 0.0001). Cumulative RASSF1A, TWIST1, and HIN1
gene methylation accurately distinguished ducts with cancerous versus benign
lesions (100% sensitivity, 72% specificity, and area under the curve of 0.91
according to receiving operating characteristic analyses). QM-MSP analysis was
more informative than cytology (100% versus 29% sensitivity, respectively), for
detecting DCIS. In a validation set of paraffin-embedded DCIS and papilloma
samples from women presenting with PND, QM-MSP was significantly higher in DNA
from DCIS than papilloma sections (P = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: The positive predictive value of ductoscopy was more than doubled
(19% versus 47%) with the addition of QM-MSP, demonstrating the benefit of
targeting ducts having both high methylation and significant abnormalities on
ductoscopy for surgical excision. Future large-scale studies to validate this
approach are needed.

Inappropriate kinase expression and subsequent promiscuous activity defines the
transformation of many solid tumors including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Thus,
the expression of novel tumor-associated kinases has the potential to
dramatically shape tumor cell behavior. Further, identifying tumor-associated
kinases can lend insight into patterns of tumor growth and characteristics. Here,
we report the identification of the RTK-like orphan receptor 2 (Ror2), a new
tumor-associated kinase in RCC cell lines and primary tumors. Ror2 is an orphan
receptor tyrosine kinase with physiological expression normally seen in the
embryonic kidney. However, in RCC, Ror2 expression correlated with expression of 
genes involved at the extracellular matrix, including Twist and matrix
metalloprotease-2 (MMP2). Expression of MMP2 in RCC cells was suppressed by Ror2 
knockdown, placing Ror2 as a mediator of MMP2 regulation in RCC and a potential
regulator of extracellular matrix remodeling. The suppression of Ror2 not only
inhibited cell migration, but also inhibited anchorage-independent growth in soft
agar and growth in an orthotopic xenograft model. These findings suggest a novel 
pathway of tumor-promoting activity by Ror2 within a subset of renal carcinomas, 
with significant implications for unraveling the tumorigenesis of RCC.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) confers destabilization of cell-cell
adhesion and cell motility required for morphogenesis or cancer metastasis. Here 
we report that zyxin, a focal adhesion-associated LIM protein, is essential for
actin reorganization for cell migration in TGF-beta1-induced EMT in normal murine
mammary gland (NMuMG) cells. TGF-beta1 induced the relocation of zyxin from focal
adhesions to actin fibers. In addition, TGF-beta1 up-regulated zyxin via a
transcription factor, Twist1. Depletion of either zyxin or Twist1 abrogated the
TGF-beta1-dependent EMT, including enhanced cell motility and actin
reorganization, indicating the TGF-beta1-Twist1-zyxin signal for EMT. Both zyxin 
and Twist1 were predominantly expressed in the cardiac atrioventricular canal
(AVC) that undergoes EMT during heart development. We further performed ex vivo
AVC explant assay and revealed that zyxin was required for the reorganization of 
actin fibers and migration of the endocardial cells. Thus, zyxin reorganizes
actin fibers and enhances cell motility in response to TGF-beta1, thereby
regulating EMT.

requiring reconstructive surgery.

Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, OX3 9DS, UK.

BACKGROUND: Congenital limb malformations (CLMs) are common and present to a
variety of specialties, notably plastic and orthopaedic surgeons, and clinical
geneticists. The authors aimed to characterise causative mutations in an
unselected cohort of patients with CLMs requiring reconstructive surgery.
METHODS: 202 patients presenting with CLM were recruited. The authors obtained
G-banded karyotypes and screened EN1, GLI3, HAND2, HOXD13, ROR2, SALL1, SALL4,
ZRS of SHH, SPRY4, TBX5, TWIST1 and WNT7A for point mutations using denaturing
high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and direct sequencing. Multiplex
ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) kits were developed and used to
measure copy number in GLI3, HOXD13, ROR2, SALL1, SALL4, TBX5 and the ZRS of SHH.
RESULTS: Within the cohort, causative genetic alterations were identified in 23
patients (11%): mutations in GLI3 (n = 5), HOXD13 (n = 5), the ZRS of SHH (n =
4), and chromosome abnormalities (n = 4) were the most common lesions found.
Clinical features that predicted the discovery of a genetic cause included a
bilateral malformation, positive family history, and having increasing numbers of
limbs affected (all p<0.01). Additionally, specific patterns of malformation
predicted mutations in specific genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on higher mutation prevalence the authors propose that GLI3,
HOXD13 and the ZRS of SHH should be prioritised for introduction into molecular
genetic testing programmes for CLM. The authors have developed simple criteria
that can refine the selection of patients by surgeons for referral to clinical
geneticists. The cohort also represents an excellent resource to test for
mutations in novel candidate genes.

Integrative genomic analyses of ZEB2: Transcriptional regulation of ZEB2 based on
SMADs, ETS1, HIF1alpha, POU/OCT, and NF-kappaB.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is defined as phenotypic change of
epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells. EMT, allowing cellular dissociation from
epithelial tissues, plays a key role in invasion and metastasis during
carcinogenesis as well as in gastrulation and neurulation during embryogenesis.
SNAI1/Snail, SNAI2/Slug, ZEB1/deltaEF1/ZFHX1A, ZEB2/SIP1/ZFHX1B, TWIST1/TWIST,
and TWIST2/DERMO1 are representative EMT regulators. ZEB2 represses transcription
of CDH1, CLDN4, CCND1, TERT, SFRP1, ALPL and miR-200b-200a-429 primary miRNA, and
upregulates transcription of mesenchymal markers. ZEB2 is relatively highly
expressed in brain corpus callosum and monocytes. ZEB2 is expressed in various
types of human tumors, such as breast cancer, gastric cancer, and pancreatic
cancer. TGFbeta, TNFalpha, IL1, AKT and hypoxia signals are involved in ZEB2
upregulation and EMT induction; however precise mechanisms of ZEB2 transcription 
remained unclear. Here, refined integrative genomic analyses of ZEB2 gene were
carried out. ZEB2 was co-expressed with POU3F2 (BRN2) and POU3F3 (BRN1) in brain 
corpus callosum, spinal cord, and fetal brain, whereas ZEB2 was co-expressed with
POU2F2 (OCT2) in monocytes. Ets-Smad-binding CGGAGAC motif, bHLH-binding site,
and POU/OCT-binding site within proximal promoter region, and NF-kappaB-binding
site within intron 2 were completely conserved in human ZEB2, chimpanzee ZEB2,
cow ZEB2, mouse Zeb2, rat Zeb2, and chicken zeb2 genes. In addition,
HIF1alpha-binding site within proximal promoter region was conserved in mammalian
ZEB2 orthologs. Consensus binding site for Hedgehog effector GLI was not
identified within or adjacent to the 7-kb regions of human ZEB2 gene. TGFbeta,
TNFalpha, IL1, and hypoxia signals directly upregulate ZEB2 to induce EMT, growth
arrest, and senescence, whereas Hedgehog signals indirectly upregulate ZEB2 via
TGFbeta. Together these facts indicate that ZEB2, occupying the crossroads of
inflammation, aging and carcinogenesis, is an important target for drug
discovery.

Requirement for Twist1 in frontonasal and skull vault development in the mouse
embryo.

Wentworthville, NSW, Australia.

Using a Cre-mediated conditional deletion approach, we have dissected the
function of Twist1 in the morphogenesis of the craniofacial skeleton. Loss of
Twist1 in neural crest cells and their derivatives impairs skeletogenic
differentiation and leads to the loss of bones of the snout, upper face and skull
vault. While no anatomically recognizable maxilla is formed, a malformed mandible
is present. Since Twist1 is expressed in the tissues of the maxillary eminence
and the mandibular arch, this finding suggests that the requirement for Twist1 is
not the same in all neural crest derivatives. The effect of the loss of Twist1
function is not restricted to neural crest-derived bones, since the predominantly
mesoderm-derived parietal and interparietal bones are also affected, presumably
as a consequence of lost interactions with neural crest-derived tissues. In
contrast, the formation of other mesodermal skeletal derivatives such as the
occipital bones and most of the chondrocranium are not affected by the loss of
Twist1 in the neural crest cells.

BACKGROUND: One of the best known functions of the zinc-finger transcription
factor Snail is to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Twist, a
target genes of Snail, is known to promote the development of distant metastases 
in mice. Increasing evidence suggests that EMT plays a pivotal role in tumor
progression and metastatic spread.
METHODS: Snail, Twist, and E-cadherin expression were assessed by
immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase 
chain reaction in 12 malignant and 35 benign pheochromocytomas (PCC). Data were
correlated with clinical characteristics and genetics.
RESULTS: We found Snail expression in 13 (28%) of 47 primary PCC samples. Twist
was expressed in 31 (66%) of 47 cases. Only one of 47 PCC showed E-cadherin
expression. We observed Snail expression in 7 (58%) of 12 malignant PCC, whereas 
only 6 (17%) of 35 apparently benign PCC revealed Snail expression (P = 0.01).
Furthermore, 11 (92%) of 12 malignant PCC, but only 20 (57%) of 35 benign PCC,
revealed Twist expression (P = 0.03). Interestingly, all five metastases showed
Snail and Twist expression. In normal adrenal medulla, Snail, Twist, and
E-cadherin expression could not be detected.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe for the first time that EMT markers Snail and Twist are 
expressed in PCC and that their expression is associated with malignancy. Our
study supports a role for EMT in the malignant transformation of PCC.

Mechanical factors activate beta-catenin-dependent oncogene expression in APC
mouse colon.

Whitehead J, Vignjevic D, Fütterer C, Beaurepaire E, Robine S, Farge E.

beta-catenin acts as a critical regulator of gastrointestinal homeostasis through
its control of the Wnt signaling pathway, and genetic or epigenetic lesions which
activate Wnt signaling are the primary feature of colon cancer. beta-catenin is
also a key element of mechanotranscription pathways, leading to upregulation of
master developmental gene expression during Drosophila gastrulation, or
regulating mammalian bone development and maintenance. Here we investigate the
impact of mechanical stimulation on the initiation of colon cancer. Myc and
Twist1, two oncogenes regulated through beta-catenin, are expressed in response
to transient compression in APC deficient (APC(1638N+)) colon tissue explants,
but not in wild-type colon explants. Mechanical stimulation of APC(1638N+) tissue
leads to the phosphorylation of beta-catenin at tyrosine 654, the site of
interaction with E-cadherin, as well as to increased nuclear localization of
beta-catenin. The mechanical activation of Myc and Twist1 expression in
APC(1638N+) colon can be prevented by blocking beta-catenin phosphorylation using
Src kinase inhibitors. Microenvironmental signals are known to cooperate with
genetic lesions to promote the nuclear beta-catenin accumulation which drives
colon cancer. Here we demonstrate that when APC is limiting, mechanical strain,
such as that associated with intestinal transit or tumor growth, can be
interpreted by cells of preneoplastic colon tissue as a signal to initiate a
beta-catenin dependent transcriptional program characteristic of cancer.

Unexpected functional redundancy between Twist and Slug (Snail2) and their
feedback regulation of NF-kappaB via Nodal and Cerberus.

A NF-kappaB-Twist-Snail network controls axis and mesoderm formation in
Drosophila. Using translation-blocking morpholinos and hormone-regulated
proteins, we demonstrate the presence of an analogous network in the early
Xenopus embryo. Loss of twist (twist1) function leads to a reduction of mesoderm 
and neural crest markers, an increase in apoptosis, and a decrease in snail1
(snail) and snail2 (slug) mRNA levels. Injection of snail2 mRNA rescues twist's
loss of function phenotypes and visa versa. In the early embryo NF-kappaB/RelA
regulates twist, snail2, and snail1 mRNA levels; similarly Nodal/Smad2 regulate
twist, snail2, snail1, and relA RNA levels. Both Twist and Snail2 negatively
regulate levels of cerberus RNA, which encodes a Nodal, bone morphogenic protein 
(BMP), and Wnt inhibitor. Cerberus's anti-Nodal activity inhibits NF-kappaB
activity and decreases relA RNA levels. These results reveal both conserved and
unexpected regulatory interactions at the core of a vertebrate's mesodermal
specification network.

Spindle cell carcinoma (SpCC) is a biphasic tumor composed of squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) and malignant spindle cells. There is mounting evidence that
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in the
pathogenesis of SpCC. Transcription repression has recently emerged as a
fundamental mechanism triggering EMT in experimental models. Our aim is to
analyze the expression of transcription repressors Snail, Slug, Twist, and SIP1
in SpCC of the head and neck in comparison to SCC, matched for location and
stage. Thirty cases of SpCC and 30 cases of SCC of the head and neck were
included. Snail, Slug, Twist, and SIP1 expression was analyzed on mRNA and
protein levels, using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. By RT-PCR, we found upregulation of mRNA for
transcription factors Snail, Slug, Twist, and SIP1 in SpCC when compared to SCC. 
This upregulation was statistically significant for Slug, Twist, and SIP1 but
nonsignificant for Snail. Immunohistochemistry was performed for Snail, Slug, and
SIP1 and demonstrated a positive reaction for Slug and SIP1 in all cases and for 
Snail in two thirds of SpCC cases. Our finding of upregulation of all four tested
transcription factors supports the hypothesis that EMT plays an important role in
the pathogenesis of SpCC of the head and neck.

BACKGROUND: Twist has been identified as a promoting factor for
epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT), which enhances the metastatic potential
of cancer. The aim of this study is to detect the expression of Twist in lung
cancer tissues and cell lines, and analyze its relationship with
clinicopathologic characteristics and biological behavior of lung cancer.
METHODS: Twist expression was examined in 68 lung cancer specimens and 8 normal
lung specimens using immunohistochemistry (S-P method). Expression levels of
Twist1 and Twist2 mRNA were detected using transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) in HBE and 8 lung cancer cell lines. Immunofluorescence was
used to detect the Twist protein expression levels and subcellular localization
in lung cancer cells and HBE (human normal bronchi epithelium) cells.
RESULTS: Among 68 lung cancer specimens, 9 samples showed weak expression of
Twist 13.24% (9 of 68), 75.00% (51 of 68) lung cancer specimens showed moderate
to strong Twist staining whereas 8 corresponding normal lung specimens showed
weak staining extent. Twist expression level was positively correlated with
differentiation (P =0.002) and age (P =0.012). Twist1 and Twist2 mRNA expression 
levels were incompatible in different histology types. The fluorescence signal of
Twist protein was conspicuous in lung squamous cell carcinoma cells and
adencarcinoma cells, primarily in cytoplasm, but low in HBE.
CONCLUSIONS: High expression of Twist in lung cancer was associated with
differentiation. Twist could be used as a valuable biomarker to evaluate the
progression of lung cancer.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS) is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome involving
craniosynostosis, craniofacial abnormalities, and syndactyly. A recent
Scandinavian study reported an increased risk of breast cancer in individuals
with a clinical diagnosis of SCS. Because of the potential importance of this
finding, we organized a multicenter study enrolling people with TWIST1 mutation
confirmed SCS to determine if an increased risk of cancer is present. This study 
did not identify any cases of breast or ovarian cancer in a cohort of equivalent 
power to that reported previously. These results provide clinical reassurance
that at present there is no evidence for breast cancer screening above standard
practice for individuals with SCS.

    Cell. 2009 Apr 3;137(1):22-4.

Brown fat is specialized for energy expenditure, a process that is principally
controlled by the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha. Here, we describe a
molecular network important for PGC-1alpha function and brown fat metabolism. We 
find that twist-1 is selectively expressed in adipose tissue, interacts with
PGC-1alpha, and is recruited to the promoters of PGC-1alpha's target genes to
suppress mitochondrial metabolism and uncoupling. In vivo, transgenic mice
expressing twist-1 in the adipose tissue are prone to high-fat-diet-induced
obesity, whereas twist-1 heterozygous knockout mice are obesity resistant. These 
phenotypes are attributed to their altered mitochondrial metabolism in the brown 
fat. Interestingly, the nuclear receptor PPARdelta not only mediates the actions 
of PGC-1alpha but also regulates twist-1 expression, suggesting a
negative-feedback regulatory mechanism. These findings reveal an unexpected
physiological role for twist-1 in the maintenance of energy homeostasis and have 
important implications for understanding metabolic control and metabolic
diseases.

Twist1-mediated adriamycin-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition relates to
multidrug resistance and invasive potential in breast cancer cells.

PURPOSE: Besides its therapeutic effects, chemotherapeutic agents also enhance
the malignancy of treated cancers in clinical situations. Recently,
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has attracted attention in studies of
tumor progression. We aimed to test whether transient Adriamycin treatment
induces EMT and apoptosis simultaneously in cancer cells, clarify why the same
type of cells responds differentially (i.e., apoptosis, EMT) to Adriamycin
treatment, and elucidate the role of Twist1, the master regulator of EMT, in this
process.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In unsynchronized MCF7 cells or cells synchronized at
different phases, apoptosis, EMT, and concurrent events [multidrug resistance
(MDR) and tumor invasion] after Adriamycin or/and Twist1 small interfering RNA
treatment were examined in vitro and in vivo. The Adriamycin-induced Twist1
expression and the interaction of Twist1 with p53-Mdm2 were examined by
immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation, respectively.
RESULTS: We showed in vitro that Adriamycin induced EMT and apoptosis
simultaneously in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Only the cells undergoing EMT
displayed enhanced invasion and MDR. Twist1 depletion completely blocked the
mesenchymal transformation, partially reversed MDR, and greatly abolished
invasion induced by Adriamycin. Also, we confirmed in vivo that Twist1 RNA
interference improved the efficacy of Adriamycin for breast cancers. Further,
Twist1 reduction in Adriamycin-treated cells promoted p53-dependent p21 induction
and disrupted the association of p53 with Mdm2.
CONCLUSIONS: Our studies show the diverse responses to Adriamycin treatment in
cells at different phases, suggest an unrecognized role of EMT in regulating MDR 
and invasion, and show the efficacy of Twist1 RNA interference in
Adriamycin-based chemotherapies for breast cancer.

Programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) has recently been shown to be involved in
both transcription and translation, and to regulate cell growth. However, the
mechanisms underlying PDCD4 function are not well understood. In this study, we
show that PDCD4 interacts directly with the transcription factor Twist1 and leads
to reduced cell growth through the down-regulation of the Twist1 target gene
Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1). PDCD4 interacts with the DNA binding domain of
Twist1, inhibiting its DNA binding ability and YB-1 expression.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed that an inverse correlation between nuclear
PDCD4 and YB-1 expression levels was observed in 37 clinical prostate cancer
specimens. Growth suppression by PDCD4 expression was completely recovered by
either Twist1 or YB-1 expression. Moreover, PDCD4-overexpressing cells are
sensitive to cisplatin and paclitaxel but not to etoposide or 5-fluorouracil. In 
summary, PDCD4 negatively regulates YB-1 expression via its interaction with
Twist1 and is involved in cancer cell growth and chemoresistance.

Medical Center, Ljubljana, Slovenia.

Three autosomal recessive disorders are associated with mutations in the RECQL4
gene: Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS), Baller-Gerold syndrome (BGS), and
RAPADILINO syndrome. BGS is characterized by two major clinical abnormalities:
craniosynostosis and preaxial limb anomalies but not cancer development. We
performed RECQL4 mutation detection in a patient with BGS and several clinical
signs of RTS who developed a midline NK/T-cell lymphoma. Sequencing was used to
identify RECQL4 mutations, and RNA analysis was used to examine expression of
mRNA in leukocytes. The patient was found to be compound heterozygous for two
mutations in exon 15, namely c.[2492_2493delAT] + c.[2506_2518del13bp]. We found 
that only the allele with 13 bp deletion was expressed in blood leukocytes. Our
patient showed severe phenotypic abnormalities, with clinical signs of both BGS
and RTS. She developed an extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, which is extremely rare 
in children of her age and is the first described case of BGS with development of
a cancer. This case of a RECQL4-related disorder highlights the significant
phenotypic overlap between the classically delineated RECQL4-associated syndromes
and questions the need to redefine or combine these clinical entities.

The pathogenesis of choroid plexus papillomas, intraventricular papillary
neoplasms most often occurring sporadically in children and young adults, remains
poorly understood. To identify pathways operative in the development of choroid
plexus papillomas, gene expression profiles obtained from laser-microdissected
human choroid plexus papilloma cells (n = 7) were compared with that of normal
choroid plexus epithelial cells laser microdissected from autopsy tissue (n = 8).
On DNA microarray data analysis, 53 probe sets were differentially expressed in
choroid plexus papilloma tumor cells (>7-fold). Up-regulation of TWIST1, WIF1,
TRPM3, BCLAF1, and AJAP1, as well as down-regulation of IL6ST was confirmed using
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Knockdown of Twist1 gene expression in
the rat choroid plexus epithelial cell line Z310 significantly reduced
proliferation as assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide assay and cell invasion in a Matrigel assay, whereas cell migration was
not affected. Screening for expressional changes of cancer-related genes upon
Twist1 knockdown revealed up-regulation of Cdkn1a, Cflar, and Serpinb2 and
down-regulation of Figf. To conclude, using gene expression profiling, several
genes differentially expressed in human choroid plexus papillomas could be
identified. Among those, TWIST1 is highly expressed in choroid plexus papillomas 
and promotes proliferation and invasion.

PURPOSE: Metastasis remains the main cause of death in both bladder (BCa) and
prostate (PCa) cancers. The results of chemotherapy did not show any significant 
improvement of the survival the past years. Cancer research has led to the
identification of signaling pathways involved and molecular targets that could
change the natural history. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), critical
during embryonic development, becomes potentially destructive in many epithelial 
tumors progression where it is inappropriately activated. The cell-cell and
cell-extracellular matrix interactions are altered to release cancer cells, which
are able to migrate toward metastatic sites. Hallmarks of EMT include the
down-regulation of E-cadherin expression, which is the main component of the
adherens junctions. The protein TWIST is a transcriptional repressor of
E-cadherin, tumor progression, and metastasis, and could be used as a molecular
target to restore the chemosensitivity in BCa and PCa.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected the last 5-year basic research literature on
EMT and TWIST but also clinical studies on BCa and PCa in which TWIST is
overexpressed and could be considered as an efficient prognostic marker and
molecular target.
RESULTS: TWIST is considered as a potential oncogene promoting the proliferation 
and inhibiting the apoptosis. TWIST promotes the synthesis of the pro-angiogenic 
factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) involved in tumor progression
and metastasis. Apoptosis and angiogenesis are two essential cancer progression
steps in many epithelial tumors, including BCa and PCa.
CONCLUSIONS: With the targeted therapy, oncology has entered into a new era,
which is going to be critical in cancer treatment in combination with traditional
anticancer drugs.

Inhibition of Akt activity induces the mesenchymal-to-epithelial reverting
transition with restoring E-cadherin expression in KB and KOSCC-25B oral squamous
cell carcinoma cells.

BACKGROUND: The Akt/PKB family of kinases is frequently activated in human
cancers, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Akt-induced
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) involves downregulation of E-cadherin,
which appears to result from upregulation of the transcription repressor Snail.
Recently, it was proposed that carcinoma cells, especially in metastatic sites,
could acquire the mesenchymal-to-epithelial reverting transition (MErT) in order 
to adapt the microenvironments and re-expression of E-cadherin be a critical
indicator of MErT. However, the precise mechanism and biologic or clinical
importance of the MErT in cancers have been little known. This study aimed to
investigate whether Akt inhibition would restore the expression of E-cadherin and
beta-catenin, reduce that of Vimentin, and induce the MErT in OSCC cells with low
or negative expression of E-cadherin. We also investigate whether inhibition of
Akt activity would affect the E-cadherin repressors and signaling molecules like 
NF-kappaB, ERK, and p38.
METHODS: We screened several OSCC cell lines in order to select suitable cell
line models for inducing MErT, using immunoblotting and methylation specific-PCR.
We examined whether Akt inhibitor phosphatidylinositol ether lipid analogues
(PIA) treatment would restore the expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin,
reduce that of Vimentin, and induce the MErT in KB and KOSCC-25B cells using
RT-PCR, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence analysis, and in vitro migration
assay. We also investigated whether inhibition of Akt activity would affect the
E-cadherin repressors, including Snail, Twist, and SIP-1/ZEB-2 and signaling
molecules like NF-kappaB, ERK, JNK, and p38 using RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and
immunofluorescence analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 7 OSCC cell lines, KB and KOSCC-25B showed constitutively
activated phosphorylated Akt and low or negative expression of E-cadherin.
Inhibition of Akt activity by PIA decreased NF-kappaB signaling, but did not
affect phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 in KB and KOSCC-25B cells. Akt
inhibition led to downregulation of Snail and Twist expression. In contrast,
inhibition of Akt activity by PIA did not induce any changes in SIP-1/ZEB-2
expression. PIA treatment induced the expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin, 
reduce that of Vimentin, restored their epithelial morphology of a polygonal
shape, and reduced tumor cell migration in KB and KOSCC-25B cells, which was the 
corresponding feature of MErT.
CONCLUSION: All of these findings suggest that Akt inhibition could induce the
MErT through decreased NF-kappaB signaling and downregulation of Snail and Twist 
in OSCC cells. A strategy involving Akt inhibition might be a useful therapeutic 
tool in controlling cancer dissemination and metastasis in oral cancer patients.

Regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in palatal fusion.

College of Dentistry, 3302 Gaston Avenue, Dallas, TX 75246, USA.

During palatal fusion, the midline epithelial seam between the palatal shelves
degrades to achieve mesenchymal confluence. Morphological and molecular evidence 
support the theory that the epithelial-mesenchymal transition is one mechanism
that regulates palatal fusion. It appears that transforming growth factor
(TGF)-beta signaling plays a role in palatal EMT. TGFbeta3 is the main inducer in
palatal fusion and activates both Smad-dependent and -independent signaling
pathways, including the key EMT transcription factors, Lef1, Twist, and Snail1,
in the MEE prior to the palatal EMT program. The roles and interactions among
these transcription factors will be discussed.

Multipotent skin-derived progenitors (SKP) can produce both neural and mesodermal
progeny in vitro, sharing the characteristics of embryonic neural crest stem
cells. However, the molecular basis for the property of multiple lineage
potential and neural crest origin of SKPs is still elusive. Here we report the
cooperative expression of pluripotency related genes (POU5F1, SOX2, NANOG, STAT3)
and neural crest marker genes (p75NTR, TWIST1, PAX3, SNAI2, SOX9, SOX10) in
GFP-transgenic porcine skin-derived progenitors (pSKP). The proportion of cells
positive for POU5F1, nestin, fibronectin, and vimentin were 12.3%, 15.1%, 67.9%
and 53.7%, showing the heterogeneity of pSKP spheres. Moreover, pSKP cells can
generate both neural (neurons and glia) and mesodermal cell types (smooth muscle 
cells and adipocytes) in vitro, indicating the multiple lineage potency. Four
transcription factors (POU5F1, SNAI2, SOX9, and PAX3) were identified that were
sensitive to mitogen (FBS) and/or growth factors (EGF and bFGF). We infer that
POU5F1, SNAI2, SOX9, and PAX3 may be the key players for maintaining the neural
crest derived multipotency of SKP cells in vitro. This study has provided new
insight into the molecular mechanism of stemness for somatic-derived stem cells
at the level of transcriptional regulation.

EphA4 as an effector of Twist1 in the guidance of osteogenic precursor cells

Heterozygous loss of Twist1 function causes coronal synostosis in both mice and
humans. We showed previously that in mice this phenotype is associated with a
defect in the neural crest-mesoderm boundary within the coronal suture, as well
as with a reduction in the expression of ephrin A2 (Efna2), ephrin A4 (Efna4) and
EphA4 in the coronal suture. We also demonstrated that mutations in human EFNA4
are a cause of non-syndromic coronal synostosis. Here we investigate the cellular
mechanisms by which Twist1, acting through Eph-ephrin signaling, regulates
coronal suture development. We show that EphA4 mutant mice exhibit defects in the
coronal suture and neural crest-mesoderm boundary that phenocopy those of
Twist1(+/-) mice. Further, we demonstrate that Twist1 and EphA4 interact
genetically: EphA4 expression in the coronal suture is reduced in Twist1 mutants,
and compound Twist1-EphA4 heterozygotes have suture defects of greater severity
than those of individual heterozygotes. Thus, EphA4 is a Twist1 effector in
coronal suture development. Finally, by DiI labeling of migratory osteogenic
precursor cells that contribute to the frontal and parietal bones, we show that
Twist1 and EphA4 are required for the exclusion of such cells from the coronal
suture. We suggest that the failure of this process in Twist1 and EphA4 mutants
is the cause of craniosynostosis.

Acetylation is one of the key chromatin modifications that control gene
transcription during embryonic development and tumorigenesis. The types of genes 
sensitive to such modifications in vivo are not known to date. We investigated
the expression of a number of genes involved in embryonic development after
treatment with trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, in
the limbs of chicken embryos. Our results show that TSA affects the expression
profiles of some genes that play important roles during limb development. The
expression of BMP4, SF/HGF and Twist1 increased, whereas the expression of BMP2, 
FGF8, Shh, Scleraxis, Myf5 and MyoD was decreased or even inhibited. In contrast,
the expression of Pax3, Paraxis, Msx1, CREB, and PCNA was not affected. Our
results indicate that the chicken embryo can serve as an effective in vivo model 
for studying the effect of HDAC inhibitors on gene expression and can be helpful 
for understanding the role of chromatin remodeling and epigenetic control of gene
expression.

TWIST1, an antiapoptotic and prometastatic transcription factor, is overexpressed
in many epithelial cancers including breast. Only little is known regarding the
regulation of TWIST1 in these cancers. Recently, an increase in the TWIST1
promoter methylation has been shown in breast cancers. To correlate the
percentage of TWIST1 promoter methylation to the protein levels, we analyzed
simultaneously the methylation status as well as the mRNA and the percentage of
cells expressing TWIST1 in normal breast tissue and 76 invasive breast cancers.
We found that TWIST1 promoter methylation is significantly more prevalent in
malignant compared with healthy breast tissue. Furthermore, the percentage of
cells expressing TWIST1 was greater in breast malignancy compared with matched
healthy tissue from the same patients. There was no correlation, however, between
TWIST1 promoter methylation and TWIST1 protein or RNA expression. This indicates 
that although TWIST1 CpG methylation is useful as a biomarker in breast cancer
diagnosis, there is no direct correlation with TWIST1 expression.

Multicellular organisms have developed innate defense mechanisms to prevent the
expansion of abnormal cells with significant proliferative potential. The two
major safeguard mechanisms are premature senescence, which is characterized by
definitive cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, the most common form of programmed
cell death. In normal and premalignant cells, the control of these processes is
coupled to the regulation of cell proliferation, mainly through the p16 (Ink4A)
-Rb and ARF-p53 intracellular signaling pathways. Hence, in benign tumors,
aberrant mitogenic activity is counterbalanced by the induction of these
oncosuppressive pathways, leading to either apoptosis or senescence which both
limit tumor outgrowth. Progression towards malignant and potentially metastatic
tumors requires the inhibition of these failsafe programs. Based on our work on
Twist oncoproteins, we propose a presentation of recent data on cellular
mechanisms by which cancer cells override the surveillance machinery and escape
senescence and apoptosis, and we will describe the biological impact of this
process on tumor metastasis.

Gene expression profiling in TWIST-depleted gastric cancer cells.

University, Harbin, China.

TWIST is an important transcription factor during embryonic development and has
recently been found to promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
phenomenon seen during the initial steps of tumor metastasis. To further
investigate the potential targets and interacting genes of TWIST in human gastric
cancer, we performed microarray analysis to compare the gene expression profiles 
in HGC-27 cells, with or without small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion
of TWIST. Our results showed that NF1, RAP1A, SRPX, RBL2, PFDN4, ILK, F2R, ERBB3,
and MYB were up-regulated, whereas AKR1C2, FOS, GDF15, NR2F1, ATM, and CTPS were 
down-regulated after TWIST depletion. Moreover, TWIST-depleted HGC-27 cells
showed a reversal of the morphologic and molecular changes associated with EMT.
These results provide evidence that TWIST regulates the expression of several
genes involved in the differentiation, adhesion, and proliferation of gastric
cancer cells. The role of TWIST in the development of certain types of gastric
cancer is discussed.

Tumor-induced upregulation of Twist, Snail, and Slug represses the activity of
the human VE-cadherin promoter.

Endothelial integrity is dependent on intracellular adherens junctions formed by 
complexes of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and catenins. We have previously 
demonstrated that exposing endothelial cells (EC) to breast cancer
cell-conditioned media (CM) for 24h results in a reduction in VE-cadherin protein
and mRNA levels. Herein, we examined the mechanism(s) involved in the
downregulation of VE-cadherin by CM. Human dermal microvascular EC exposed to CM 
showed a downregulation in VE-cadherin promoter activity and upregulation of
Twist, Slug, and Snail expression. Reporter gene analysis demonstrated a direct
repression of the VE-cadherin promoter by Slug, Snail, and Twist expression
plasmids. At least two E-box motifs appear to be involved in this regulatory
process as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. These results suggest 
that factors released by breast cancer cells are able to upregulate Twist, Slug, 
and Snail expression in EC, which in turn downregulate the activity of the
VE-cadherin promoter.

OBJECTIVE: To study the mechanisms of the Twist gene and cell transition during
the angiogenesis in a mouse model of oxygen induced retinopathy.
METHODS: It was a experimental study. 40 new born C57/BL mice were divided into
two groups; the control group, which were fed in the room air, and the study
group, which were fed 7 days in the normal environment, followed by exposure to
hyperoxia (75% O2) for 5 days. The mice were sacrificed at post born 12 day and
post born 17 day. The Twist and VE-cadherin expression were detected with
immunohistochemistry. The total retinal RNA was extracted and the expression
level of the VE-cadherin, vimentin and twist were examined with RT-PCR method.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry proved there was no significant difference at post 
born 12 day. At post born 17 day, compared with the control group (75.36 +/-
7.04),VE-cadherin expression of hyperoxia group (65.19 +/- 8.39) decreased (F
=8.616, P =0.009). Compared with the control group (82.14 +/- 6.32), Vimentin
expression of hyperoxia group (95.09 +/- 14.13) increased, compared with the
control group (93.30 +/- 6.37), Twist expression of hyperoxia group (119.48 +/-
7.90) increased (F = 66.557, P = 0.000) significantly. RT-PCR examination
revealed there exist the interaction between Vimentin, Twist expression and the
detection time (F = 5.508, P = 0.032; F = 17.760, P = 0.001; respectively). At
post born 12 day, compared with the control group (0.77 +/- 0.10), VE-cadherin
expression of hyperoxia group (0.64 +/- 0.09) decreased (P = 0.047). Compared
with the control group (0.24 +/- 0.05), Vimentin expression of hyperoxia group
(0.39 +/- 0.09) increased (P = 0.033). At post born 17 day, compared with the
control group (0.75 +/- 0.12), VE-cadherin expression of hyperoxia group (0.51
+/- 0.07) decreased more obviously (P = 0.002), compared with the control group
(0.36 +/- 0.06), Vimentin expression of hyperoxia group (0.70 +/- 0.14) increased
(P = 0.000). Compared with the control group(0.89 +/- 0.11), Twist expression of 
hyperoxia group (1.24 +/- 0.15) increased (P = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: Twist, as a cell transition gene, participated in the angiogenesis of
the oxygen induced retinopathy, and that the Twist induced
endothelium-mesenchymal transition may be one of the main reasons.

MicroRNAs are known to regulate developmental processes but their mechanism of
regulation remains largely uncharacterized. We show the transcription factor
Twist-1 drives the expression of a 7.9-kb noncoding RNA transcript (from the
Dynamin-3 gene intron) that encodes a miR-199a and miR-214 cluster. We also show 
that knocking down Twist-1 with shRNAs decreased miR-199a/214 levels and that
Twist-1 bound an E-Box promoter motif to developmentally regulate the expression 
of these miRNAs. The expression of HIF-1 (known to mediate Twist-1
transcription), miR-199a and miR-214 was maximal at E12.5 and the miRNAs were
expressed specifically in mouse cerebellum, midbrain, nasal process and fore- and
hindlimb buds. This study shows the expression of the miR199a/214 cluster is
controlled by Twist-1 via an E-Box promoter element and supports a role for these
miRNAs as novel intermediates in the pathways controlling the development of
specific neural cell populations.

BACKGROUND: TWIST1 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that
has been involved in tumor progression and metastasis in several cancer types,
although no evidence has been provided yet on its implication in colorectal
carcinogenesis.
METHODS: We examined the expression pattern of TWIST1 messenger RNA (mRNA) in 54 
colorectal cancer biopsies compared with each respective adjacent normal mucosa
by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
methodology.
RESULTS: TWIST1 mRNA was found significantly overexpressed in colorectal cancer
samples compared to nontumorous colon mucosa (P < 0.0001). Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that TWIST1 mRNA levels are
significantly increased in patients with nodal invasion and, interestingly, a
significant correlation with patient sex was also found.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for upregulation of TWIST1 mRNA in colorectal cancer is
provided, suggesting its implication in the onset of malignant progression of
this disease. In addition, significant higher levels of TWIST1 mRNA were found in
men than in women, suggesting a possible transcriptional regulation of TWIST1 by 
sexual hormones. The use of TWIST1 as a new prognostic marker of advanced
malignancy, and as a potential therapeutic target in colorectal cancer, is
proposed.

[The pro-inflammatory immunological memory : twist1 as a marker for chronically

State-of-the-art immunosuppressive therapies, though efficient in the treatment
of rheumatic inflammatory disorders, in most cases do not provide a cure.
Complete immunablation and the associated deletion of the reactive immunological 
memory followed by reconstitution of the "healthy" immune system from stem cells 
results in a therapy-free remission in many patients suffering from rheumatic
diseases. Chronically activated T helper (Th) lymphocytes seem to play a critical
role in this reactive pathogenic memory. We have shown that the transcription
factor twist1 is specifically expressed in chronically activated, inflammatory Th
cells. Twist1 as a biomarker for such Th cells enables the identification and
elucidation of the role of Th cells in chronic inflammation and opens new
therapeutic options for the targeted manipulation of the pathogenic, reactive
memory, such as the targeted deletion of twist1 expressing pathogenic Th cells.

Milk fat globule EGF-8 promotes melanoma progression through coordinated Akt and

The pathogenesis of malignant melanoma involves the interplay of tumor cells with
normal host elements, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. 
Here, we show that milk fat globule EGF-8 (MFG-E8), a secreted protein expressed 
at high levels in the vertical growth phase of melanoma, promotes disease
progression through coordinated alpha(v)beta(3) integrin signaling in the tumor
microenvironment. In a murine model of melanoma, MFG-E8 enhanced tumorigenicity
and metastatic capacity through Akt-dependent and Twist-dependent pathways.
MFG-E8 augmented melanoma cell resistance to apoptosis, triggered an
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and stimulated invasion and immune
suppression. In human melanoma cells, MFG-E8 knockdown attenuated Akt and Twist
signaling and thereby compromised tumor cell survival, EMT, and invasive ability.
MFG-E8-deficient human melanoma cells also showed increased sensitivity to small 
molecule inhibitors of insulin-like growth factor I receptor and c-Met. Together,
these findings delineate pleiotropic roles for MFG-E8 in the tumor
microenvironment and raise the possibility that systemic MFG-E8 blockade might
prove therapeutic for melanoma patients.

Basic Helix-loop-Helix (bHLH) factors play a significant role in both development
and disease. bHLH factors function as protein dimers where two bHLH factors
compose an active transcriptional complex. In various species, the bHLH factor
Twist has been shown to play critical roles in diverse developmental systems such
as mesoderm formation, neurogenesis, myogenesis, and neural crest cell migration 
and differentiation. Pathologically, Twist1 is a master regulator of
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and is causative of the
autosomal-dominant human disease Saethre Chotzen Syndrome (SCS). Given the wide
spectrum of Twist1 expression in the developing embryo and the diverse roles it
plays within these forming tissues, the question of how Twist1 fills some of
these specific roles has been largely unanswered. Recent work has shown that
Twist's biological function can be regulated by its partner choice within a given
cell. Our work has identified a phosphoregulatory circuit where phosphorylation
of key residues within the bHLH domain alters partner affinities for Twist1; and 
more recently, we show that the DNA binding affinity of the complexes that do
form is affected in a cis-element dependent manner. Such perturbations are
complex as they not only affect direct transcriptional programs of Twist1, but
they indirectly affect the transcriptional outcomes of any bHLH factor that can
dimerize with Twist1. Thus, the resulting lineage-restricted cell fate defects
are a combination of loss-of-function and gain-of-function events. Relating the
observed phenotypes of defective Twist function with this complex regulatory
mechanism will add insight into our understanding of the critical functions of
this complex transcription factor.

OBJECTIVES: Expression of transcription factors that mediate
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), such as Twist and Slug, is correlated
with poor prognosis in many tumor types. Selected EMT markers were studied in a
series of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAs) and benign pancreatic tissues 
to determine whether expression levels correlated with diagnosis, histologic
grade, or patient outcome.
METHODS: Immunohistochemical stains for Twist, Slug, and N-cadherin were
performed using a tissue microarray containing 68 PDAs and 38 samples of normal
pancreas or chronic pancreatitis tissues.
RESULTS: Twist and Slug were identified in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of
benign pancreatic ductal epithelium, chronic pancreatitis, and PDA. Compared with
normal ductal epithelium, nuclear levels of Twist are decreased in PDA. None of
the other EMT markers showed significant differences in staining indices among
the diagnostic groups. There were no correlations between EMT marker expression
and histologic grade. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker expression was not
associated with N-cadherin expression, patient outcome, or duration of survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Decreased expression of nuclear Twist is observed in malignant
pancreatic epithelium. However, use of Twist as a diagnostic marker is precluded 
because decreased expression is also seen in chronic pancreatitis. None of the
markers studied were predictive of patient outcome.

Hedgehog signaling, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and miRNA (review).

Katoh Y(1), Katoh M.

Author information: 
(1)M&M Medical Bioinformatics, Hongo 113-003, Japan.

SHH, IHH, and DHH are lipid-modified secreted proteins binding to Patched
receptors, and CDON, BOC or GAS1 co-receptors. In the absence of Hedgehog
signaling, GLI1 is transcriptionally repressed, GLI2 is phosphorylated by GSK3
and CK1 for the FBXW11 (betaTRCP2)-mediated degradation, and GLI3 is processed to
a cleaved repressor. In the presence of Hedgehog signaling, Smoothened is
relieved from Patched-mediated suppression due to the Hedgehog-dependent
internalization of Patched, which leads to MAP3K10 (MST) activation and SUFU
inactivation for the stabilization and nuclear accumulation of GLI family
members. GLI activators then upregulate CCND1, CCND2 for cell cycle acceleration,
FOXA2, FOXC2, FOXE1, FOXF1, FOXL1, FOXP3, POU3F1, RUNX2, SOX13, TBX2 for cell
fate determination, JAG2, INHBC, and INHBE for stem cell signaling regulation.
Hedgehog signals also upregulate SFRP1 in mesenchymal cells for WNT signaling
regulation. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during embryogenesis,
adult tissue homeostasis and carcinogenesis is characterized by class switch from
E-cadherin to N-cadherin. SNAI1 (Snail), SNAI2 (Slug), SNAI3, ZEB1, ZEB2 (SIP1), 
KLF8, TWIST1, and TWIST2 are EMT regulators repressing CDH1 gene encoding
E-cadherin. Hedgehog signals induce JAG2 upregulation for Notch-CSL-mediated
SNAI1 upregulation, and also induce TGFbeta1 secretion for ZEB1 and ZEB2
upregulation via TGFbeta receptor and NF-kappaB. TGFbeta-mediated downregulation 
of miR-141, miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-205, and miR-429 results in
upregulation of ZEB1 and ZEB2 proteins. Hedgehog signaling activation indirectly 
leads to EMT through FGF, Notch, TGFbeta signaling cascades, and miRNA regulatory
networks. miRNAs targeted to stem cell signaling components or EMT regulators are
potent drug targets; however, off-target effects should be strictly controlled
before clinical application of synthetic miRNA. Peptide mimetic and RNA aptamer
could also be utilized as Hedgehog signaling inhibitors or EMT suppressors.

The basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional repressor twist1, as an antagonist of 
nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent cytokine expression, is involved in
the regulation of inflammation-induced immunopathology. We show that twist1 is
expressed by activated T helper (Th) 1 effector memory (EM) cells. Induction of
twist1 in Th cells depended on NF-kappaB, nuclear factor of activated T cells
(NFAT), and interleukin (IL)-12 signaling via signal transducer and activator of 
transcription (STAT) 4. Expression of twist1 was transient after T cell receptor 
engagement, and increased upon repeated stimulation of Th1 cells. Imprinting for 
enhanced twist1 expression was characteristic of repeatedly restimulated EM Th
cells, and thus of the pathogenic memory Th cells characteristic of chronic
inflammation. Th lymphocytes from the inflamed joint or gut tissue of patients
with rheumatic diseases, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis expressed high
levels of twist1. Expression of twist1 in Th1 lymphocytes limited the expression 
of the cytokines interferon-gamma, IL-2, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and
ameliorated Th1-mediated immunopathology in delayed-type hypersensitivity and
antigen-induced arthritis.

Intricate gene regulatory networks of helix-loop-helix (HLH) proteins support

Helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factors are key regulators of neurogenesis, 
myogenesis and osteogenesis. Here the relative contributions of multiple classes 
of HLH factors to the expression of bone related genes during osteoblast
maturation were compared. We examined the expression of a panel of HLH proteins
(e.g., Twist1/2, USF1/2, c-Myc, Id1 approximately 4, E12/47, Stra13) and one Zn
finger protein (Snail which recognizes a subset of E-boxes), during osteoblast
differentiation and their functional contributions to bone phenotypic gene
regulation. While expression of Twist1, Stra13, E12/47 and Snail transcripts
remains relatively constant, expression of Twist2 as well as the inhibitory
factors Id1, Id2, Id3, and Id4 decreases and USF1 is up-regulated during
osteoblastic differentiation of MC3T3 cells. Forced expression of selected HLH
transcription factors shows that Myc, Snail and USF factors increase expression
of the bone markers osteocalcin (OC) and/or alkaline phosphatase (AP), while
E12/47, Twist and Id factors decrease their expression. None of these factors
affect Runx2 gene expression. Interestingly, Snail enhances expression of
osteoblast markers, while Twist1 and Twist2 factors are cross-regulated and
inhibit bone specific gene expression and other HLH proteins (e.g., Id)
indirectly. Thus, our data suggest that the integrated activities of negative and
positive E-box related regulatory factors control osteoblast differentiation.

BACKGROUND: Promoter methylation is a common epigenetic mechanism to silence
tumor suppressor genes during breast cancer development. We investigated whether 
BRCA1-associated breast tumors show cancer-predictive methylation patterns
similar to those found in sporadic tumors.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quantitative multiplex methylation-specific PCR of 11 genes
involved in breast carcinogenesis (RARB, RASSF1, TWIST1, CCND2, ESR1, SCGB3A1,
BRCA1, BRCA2, CDKN2A, APC, CDH1) was carried out on 32 BRCA1-associated and 46
sporadic breast carcinomas and on normal breast tissue from seven BRCA1 mutation 
carriers and 13 non-carriers.
RESULTS: The extent of cumulative methylation increased with age (P < 0.001). The
median cumulative methylation index (CMI) of all studied genes was significantly 
higher in tumors (89) than in normal tissue (13, P < 0.001). The median CMI was
significantly lower in BRCA1-associated (59) than in sporadic breast tumors (122,
P = 0.001), in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors (73) than in ER-positive
tumors (122, P = 0.005) and in lymph node-negative (77) compared with lymph
node-positive tumors (137, P = 0.007). In subgroup analysis, the effect of a
BRCA1 germline mutation on methylation proved to be independent of ER status,
lymph node status and age.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that BRCA1-associated breast cancers show less
promoter methylation compared with sporadic breast carcinomas indicating a
difference in disease etiology.

Shared gene expression profiles in developing heart valves and osteoblast
progenitor cells.

Center, Cincinnati, Ohio 45229, USA.

The atrioventricular (AV) valves of the heart develop from undifferentiated
mesenchymal endocardial cushions, which later mature into stratified valves with 
diversified extracellular matrix (ECM). Because the mature valves express genes
associated with osteogenesis and exhibit disease-associated calcification, we
hypothesized the existence of shared regulatory pathways active in developing AV 
valves and in bone progenitor cells. To define gene regulatory programs of
valvulogenesis relative to osteoblast progenitors, we undertook Affymetrix gene
expression profiling analysis of murine embryonic day (E)12.5 AV endocardial
cushions compared with E17.5 AV valves (mitral and tricuspid) and with
preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 (subclone4) cells. Overall, MC3T3 cells were significantly
more similar to E17.5 valves than to E12.5 cushions, supporting the hypothesis
that valve maturation involves the expression of many genes also expressed in
osteoblasts. Several transcription factors characteristic of mesenchymal and
osteoblast precursor cells, including Twist1, are predominant in E12.5 cushion.
Valve maturation is characterized by differential regulation of matrix
metalloproteinases and their inhibitors as well as complex collagen gene
expression. Among the most highly enriched genes during valvulogenesis were
members of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family including Asporin, a
known negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation and mineralization.
Together, these data support shared gene expression profiles of the developing
valves and osteoblast bone precursor cells in normal valve development and
homeostasis with potential functions in calcific valve disease.

Twist1 and Twist2 are major regulators of embryogenesis. Twist1 has been shown to
favor the metastatic dissemination of cancer cells through its ability to induce 
an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, we show that a large fraction
of human cancers overexpress Twist1 and/or Twist2. Both proteins override
oncogene-induced premature senescence by abrogating key regulators of the p53-
and Rb-dependent pathways. Twist1 and Twist2 cooperate with Ras to transform
mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Interestingly, in epithelial cells, the oncogenic
cooperation between Twist proteins and activated mitogenic oncoproteins, such as 
Ras or ErbB2, leads to complete EMT. These findings suggest an unanticipated
direct link between early escape from failsafe programs and the acquisition of
invasive features by cancer cells.

The acquisition of a fully malignant phenotype is limited by several barriers,
including cellular senescence and the requirement to undergo an
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Deregulation of these processes is
believed to occur by largely independent events. In this issue of Cancer Cell,
Ansieau et al. (2008) challenge this view.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer with EGFR mutation was shown to be a specific clinical
entity. In order to better understand the biology behind this disease we used a
genome wide characterization of loss of heterozygosity and amplification by
Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Array analysis to point out chromosome
segments linked to EGFR mutations. To do so, we compared genetic profiles between
EGFR mutated adenocarcinomas (ADC) and KRAS mutated ADC from 24 women with
localized lung cancer.
RESULTS: Patterns of alterations were different between EGFR and KRAS mutated
tumors and specific chromosomes alterations were linked to the EGFR mutated
group. Indeed chromosome regions 14q21.3 (p = 0.027), 7p21.3-p21.2 (p = 0.032),
7p21.3 (p = 0.042) and 7p21.2-7p15.3 (p = 0.043) were found significantly
amplified in EGFR mutated tumors. Within those regions 3 genes are of special
interest ITGB8, HDAC9 and TWIST1. Moreover, homozygous deletions at CDKN2A and
LOH at RB1 were identified in EGFR mutated tumors. We therefore tested the
existence of a link between EGFR mutation, CDKN2A homozygous deletion and cyclin 
amplification in a larger series of tumors. Indeed, in a series of non-small-cell
lung carcinoma (n = 98) we showed that homozygous deletions at CDKN2A were linked
to EGFR mutations and absence of smoking whereas cyclin amplifications (CCNE1 and
CCND1) were associated to TP53 mutations and smoking habit.
CONCLUSION: All together, our results show that genome wide patterns of
alteration differ between EGFR and KRAS mutated lung ADC, describe two models of 
oncogenic cooperation involving either EGFR mutation and CDKN2A deletion or
cyclin amplification and TP53 inactivating mutations and identified new
chromosome regions at 7p and 14q associated to EGFR mutations in lung cancer.

An absence of Twist1 results in aberrant cardiac neural crest morphogenesis.

The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist1 plays an essential role in
mesenchymal cell populations during embryonic development and in pathological
disease. Remodeling of the cardiac outflow tract (OFT) into the functionally
separate aortic arch and pulmonary trunk is dependent upon the dynamic,
coordinated contribution of multiple mesenchymal cell populations. Here, we
report that Twist1(-/-) mice exhibit OFTs that contain amorphic cellular nodules 
within their OFT endocardial cushions. The nodular mesenchyme expresses the
related bHLH factors Hand1 and Hand2, but reduced levels of the normal cushion
marker Periostin. Lineage mapping confirms that nodule cells are exclusively of
cardiac neural crest origin (cNCC), and are not ectopic cardiomyocytes or smooth 
muscle cells. These studies also reveal a delay in cNCC colonization of the OFT
cushions. Furthermore, these mapping studies uncover nodules in the pharyngeal
arches, and identify Twist1(-/-) neural crest cell defects within the dorsal
neural tube, which exhibits an expanded domain of Wnt1-Cre-lineage marked cells. 
Together, these data support a model where Twist1 is required both for proper
cNCC delamination, and for emigration from the dorsal neural tube and along cNCC 
migration pathways. Within the Twist1(-/-) neural crest cell populations that do 
emigrate to the OFT, a Hand-expressing subpopulation displays defective
maturation, tracking, and, presumably, cell-cell adhesion, further compromising
cNCC morphogenesis.

Twist is required for thrombin-induced tumor angiogenesis and growth.

(1)Department of Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New 
York 10016, USA.

Twist, a master regulator of embryonic morphogenesis, induces functions that are 
also required for tumor invasion and metastasis. Because thrombin contributes to 
the malignant phenotype by up-regulating tumor metastasis, we examined its effect
on Twist in five different tumor cell lines and two different endothelial cell
lines. Thrombin up-regulated Twist mRNA and protein in all seven cell lines.
Down-regulation of Twist in B16F10 tumor cell lines led to a approximately 3-fold
decrease in tumor growth on a chorioallantoic membrane assay and approximately
2-fold decrease in syngeneic mice. Angiogenesis was decreased approximately 45%
and 36%, respectively. The effect of Twist on angiogenesis was further examined
and compared with the effect of thrombin. In studies using a Twist-inducible
plasmid, several identical vascular growth factors and receptors were
up-regulated approximately 2- to 3-fold in tumor cells as well as human umbilical
vascular endothelial cells by both Twist as well as thrombin (vascular
endothelial growth factor, KDR, Ang-2, matrix metalloproteinase 1, GRO-alpha, and
CD31). Thrombin-induced endothelial cell chemotaxis and Matrigel endothelial cell
tubule formation were similarly regulated by Twist. Thus, thrombin up-regulates
Twist, which is required for thrombin-induced angiogenesis as measured by
endothelial cell migration, Matrigel tubule formation, and tumor angiogenesis.

OBJECTIVE: To study Twist expression in thyroid papillary carcinoma (PTC) by
immunohistochemistry and to assess its usefulness as marker in the differential
diagnosis of PTC, follicular adenomas (FA) and benign papillary lesions (BPL).
METHODS: Fifty cases of PTC, 48 cases of FA and 47 cases of BPL were evaluated
using manual tissue chip and SP immunohistochemical stain to detect the
expression of Twist and HBME-1, and comparing the staining to that of cytokeratin
19 (CK19).
RESULTS: In PTC, positive rates of Twist, HBME-1 and CK19 were 100% (48/48),
94.0% (47/50) and 78.0% (39/ 50) respectively; in FA, positive rates were 0, 6.7%
(3/45) and 0 respectively; in BPL, positive rates were 7.0% (3/34), 2.1% (1/47)
and 0, respectively. The differences between PTC and FA and between PTC and BPL
were both statistically significant (P = 0. 000). The sensitivity of Twist,
HBME-1 and CK19 was 100%, 94.0% and 78.0%; the specifity was 96.4%, 95.7% and
100%; overall accurary was 97.7%, 95.1% and 91.9%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Positive rates of Twist is higher than the other markers in PTC.
Immunohistochemical staining of Twist has important significance in the
differential diagnosis of thyroid lesions. Twist immunohistochemistry maybe
helpful in diagnosis and differential diagnosis of PTC.

Role of Twist in head and neck carcinoma with lymph node metastasis.

Ou DL(1), Chien HF, Chen CL, Lin TC, Lin LI.

Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.

The transcription factor Twist protein has been found to be correlated with
metastasis in various carcinomas, including hepatocellular, breast and prostate
carcinomas. However, the role of Twist in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas 
(HNSCC) remains unknown. Head and neck cancer tissue microarrays (TMAs) of tumors
from 50 patients with HNSCC were examined. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stain
analysis showed that, out of the 50 patients, twenty (40%) showed Twist-positive 
staining in the tumor cells, and Twist expression was positively associated with 
differentiation status (p=0.027), lymph node metastasis (p=0.032) and disease
progression (p=0.029). Further analysis revealed that the expression of Twist was
positively correlated with CXCR4 (Spearman, r=0.408, p=0.003) and CCR7 (r=0.417, 
p=0.003). FindPatterns analysis suggested that the transcription factor Twist, as
a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein, might regulate CXCR4 and CCR7 expression
in squamous cell carcinomas, which in turn might be associated with lymph node
metastasis.

Twist is basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that binds to E-boxes in
gene promoters. Twist possesses an oncogenic function by interfering with the
tumor suppressor function of p53. Using a membrane pull-down assay, we found that
Twist directly interacts with p53 and that this interaction underlies the
inhibitory effects on p53 target gene expression. Twist interacted with the
DNA-binding domain of p53 and suppressed the DNA-binding activity of p53.
Transcriptional activation of the p21 promoter by p53 was significantly repressed
by the expression of Twist. On the other hand, p53 interacted with the N-terminal
domain of Twist and repressed Twist-dependent YB-1 promoter activity.
Importantly, we found that p53-dependent growth suppression was canceled by the
expression of either Twist or YB-1. Thus, our data suggest that Twist inhibits
p53 function via a direct interaction with p53.

The regulatory mechanisms underlying myometrial smooth muscle contractility
during labor are poorly understood. The authors therefore investigated the
transcriptional profile of the changes that occur in the human myometrium at term
pregnancy when compared with that at labor. Microarray technology was used to
identify differentially expressed genes in human myometrium at labor. Real-time
fluorescence reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was
subsequently performed to verify the microarray data. Semiquantitative RT-PCR,
Western blotting, and microscopy methodologies were also used. Certain novel
genes were found to be upregulated in human myometrium at labor. Of these,
PSCDBP, TLR2, TWIST1 , FLJ35382, andRGS12 have not been previously characterized 
or identified in human myometrium. EDNRB is the other novel labor-associated gene
whose reported expression is also upregulated at labor. All 6 genes were
expressed on human myometrial smooth muscle cells. These novel upregulated genes 
are involved in multiple pathways that may be associated with a variety of
cellular processes including inflammation, transcriptional regulation, and
intracellular signaling.

Speckle tracking imaging (STI) was employed to investigate the effect of right
ventricular (RV) volume and pressure overload on left ventricular (LV) rotation
and twist in 35 patients with atrial septal defect (ASD), 18 of which with
pulmonary hypertension, and 21 healthy subjects serving as controls. The peak
rotations of 6 segments at the basal and apical short-axises and the average peak
rotation and interval time of the 6 segments in the opposite direction during
early systolic phase were measured respectively. LV twist versus time profile was
drawn and the peak twist and time to peak twist were calculated. LV ejection
fraction (EF) was measured by Biplane Simpson. Compared to ASD patients without
pulmonary hypertension and healthy subjects, the peak rotations of posterior,
inferior and postsept walls at the basal level were lower (P<0.05), and the
average counterclockwise peak rotation of 6 segments at the basal level during
early systolic phase was higher (P<0.05), and the average interval time was
delayed (P<0.05). LV peak twist was also lower (P<0.05), and had a significant
negative correlation with pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (r=-0.57,
P=0.001). No significant differences were found in LVEF among the three groups.
It was suggested that although RV volume overload due to ASD has no significant
effects on LV rotation and twist, LV peak twist is lower in ASD patients with
pulmonary hypertension. Thus LV twist may serve as a new indicator of the
presence of pulmonary hypertension in ASD patients.

In order to investigate the role of Twist gene in the metastasis of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), total RNA was respectively extracted from three
HCC cell strains with different metastatic potentials, HepG2, MHCC-97L and
MHCC-97H. The first strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription, which
was then used as template to perform fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (FQ-PCR). The quantity of Twist gene expression was normalized by that
of the housekeeping gene, GAPDH for each sample. ANOVA was used to estimate the
relationship between Twist gene and metastasis potential of HCC. The results
showed that the normalized initial cDNA concentrations of Twist gene in HepG2,
MHCC-97L and MHCC-97H were (9.45+/-0.25)x10(-4), (1.82+/-0.41)x10(-3),
(3.06+/-0.62)x10(-3), respectively. FQ-PCR revealed significant differences in
the expression level of Twist among HCC cell strains with different metastatic
potentials. It was concluded that high expression level of Twist was closely
associated with more aggressive behaviors of HCC. Twist provides a novel
indicator for HCC metastasis.

Haploinsufficiency of the transcription factor TWIST1 is associated with
Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome and is manifested by craniosynostosis, which is the
premature closure of the calvaria sutures. Previously, we found that Twist1 forms
functional homodimers and heterodimers that have opposing activities. Our data
supported a model that within the calvaria sutures Twist1 homodimers (T/T) reside
in the osteogenic fronts while Twist1/E protein heterodimers (T/E) are in the
mid-sutures. Twist1 haploinsufficiency alters the balance between these dimers,
favoring an increase in homodimer formation throughout the sutures. The data we
present here further supports this model and extends it to integrate the Twist1
dimers with the pathways that are known to regulate cranial suture patency. This 
data provides the first evidence of a functional link between Twist1 and the FGF 
pathway, and indicates that differential regulation of FGF signaling by T/T and
T/E dimers plays a central role in governing cranial suture patency. Furthermore,
we show that inhibition of FGF signaling prevents craniosynostosis in Twist1(+/-)
mice, demonstrating that inhibition of a signaling pathway that is not part of
the initiating mutation can prevent suture fusion in a relevant genetic model of 
craniosynostosis.

TWIST modulates prostate cancer cell-mediated bone cell activity and is
upregulated by osteogenic induction.

China.

TWIST, a helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is highly expressed in many types
of human cancer. We have previously found that TWIST confers prostate cancer
cells with an enhanced metastatic potential through promoting
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and a high TWIST expression in human
prostate cancer is associated with an increased metastatic potential. The
predilection of prostate cancer cells to metastasize to bone may be due to two
interplaying mechanisms (i) by increasing the rate of bone remodeling and (ii) by
undergoing osteomimicry. We further studied the role of TWIST in promoting
prostate cancer to bone metastasis. TWIST expression in PC3, a metastatic
prostate cancer cell line, was silenced by small interfering RNA and we found
that conditioned medium from PC3 with lower TWIST expression had a lower activity
on stimulating osteoclast differentiation and higher activity on stimulating
osteoblast mineralization. In addition, we found that these effects were, at
least partly, associated with TWIST-induced expression of dickkopf homolog 1
(DKK-1), a factor that promotes osteolytic metastasis. We also examined TWIST and
RUNX2 expressions during osteogenic induction of an organ-confined prostate
cancer cell, 22Rv1. We observed increased TWIST and RUNX2 expressions upon
osteogenic induction and downregulation of TWIST through short hairpin RNA
reduced the induction level of RUNX2. In summary, our results suggest that, in
addition to EMT, TWIST may also promote prostate cancer to bone metastasis by
modulating prostate cancer cell-mediated bone remodeling via regulating the
expression of a secretory factor, DKK-1, and enhancing osteomimicry of prostate
cancer cells, probably, via RUNX2.

Multiple genotypic aberrances associate to terminal differentiation-deficiency of
an oral squamous cell carcinoma in serum-free culture.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) lines proliferative in the serum-free
conditions devised for normal oral keratinocytes (NOK) are virtually absent,
complicating studies of carcinogenesis. A tongue squamous cell carcinoma
generated under conditions for normal cell culture an apparently immortal line
(termed LK0412) that has undergone >or=200 population doublings from over a year 
in culture. LK0412 exhibited epithelial morphology, intermediate filaments,
desmosomes, and cytokeratin. Soft agar growth and tumorigenicity in athymic nude 
mice indicated the malignant phenotype. Compared with NOK, LK0412 exhibited
increased indices for proliferation and apoptosis, and a decreased terminal
differentiation index. Fetal bovine serum inhibited growth and increased
apoptosis but failed to induce terminal differentiation of LK0412; the latter
outcome differed clearly from that in NOK. Gene ontology assessment of transcript
profiles implicated multiple alterations in biological processes, molecular
functions, and cellular components in LK0412. Genetic changes, some that were
confirmed to the protein level, included previously proposed OSCC markers, i.e., 
BAX, CDC2, and TP53, as well as multiple cancer-associated genes not considered
for OSCC, e.g., BST2, CRIP1, ISG15, KLRC1, NEDD9, NNMT, and TWIST1. Elevation of 
p53 protein agreed with a missense mutation detectable in both the LK0412 line
and the original tumor specimen. Moderate differentiation characterized the
original tumor as well as tumors generated from inoculation of LK0412 in mice.
Overall, the results suggest that the LK0412 cell line represent a subgroup of
OSCC with unique genomic and phenotypic profiles. LK0412 should be useful to
exploration of OSCC development, particularly the deregulated growth and
differentiation responsiveness to serum factors.

AIM: To study the effect of the transfected Twist gene on invasion and metastasis
of gastric carcinoma cells and the possible mechanisms involved.
METHODS: Human gastric carcinoma MKN28 cells were stably transfected with Twist
sense plasmid, and MKN45 cells were stably transfected with Twist antisense
plasmid using the lipofectamine transfection technique. RT-PCR, Western blotting,
EMSA, gelatin zymography assay, and in vitro invasion and migration assays were
performed. Nude mice metastasis models were established by the abdominal cavity
transfer method.
RESULTS: Cell models (TwistS-MKN28) that steadily expressed high Twist protein
were obtained. Compared with MKN28 and pcDNA3-MKN28 cells, adherence, migration
and invasion ability of TwistS-MKN28 cells were clearly raised. The number of
cancer nodules was increased significantly in the abdominal cavity and liver of
nude mice inoculated with TwistS-MKN28 cells. Overexpression of Twist in MKN28
cells increased Tcf-4/Lef DNA binding activity, and promoted expression of
Tcf-4's downstream target genes cyclin D1 and MMP-2. However, suppression of
Twist (TwistAS-MKN45) inhibited MKN45 cell invasion and the expression of cyclin 
D1 was reduced. The activity of MMP-2 was also decreased.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that Twist promotes gastric cancer cell
migration, invasion and metastasis, and Twist may play an important role in
Wnt/Tcf-4 signaling.

OBJECTIVES: Twist is considered as transcription factor that regulates epithelial
mesenchymal transition (EMT) by at least inhibition of E-cadherin expression. EMT
is a key event in the tumor invasion process. The purpose of this study is to
investigate the expression of Twist but also those of E- and N-cadherin in human 
primary bladder tumor and to evaluate its prognostic value. As smoking cigarettes
is a strong bladder cancer risk factor, we tried to evaluate the impact of the
tobacco status on these molecular abnormalities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To delineate on the oncogenic role for Twist in human
bladder cancer, we evaluated the E- and N-cadherin but also Twist expression (n =
70) by immunohistochemistry. We evaluated the prognostic value of these
expressions. Moreover, we tried to correlate these protein expressions to the
smoking status of the patients. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free
survival (PFS) were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and multivariate
analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazard analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 70 bladder tumors, 28 (40%) cases were positive for Twist
expression, 16 (23%) cases were negative for E-cadherin expression, and 12 (17%) 
were positive for N-cadherin expression. When categorized into negative vs.
positive expression, Twist was associated with the stage (P = 0.001), the grade
(P < 0.001), the progression (P = 0.02), and the E-cadherin expression (P =
0.01). Moreover, positive Twist expression clearly predicted poorer PFS (P =
0.02). In the multivariate analysis, both positive Twist expression and loss of
E-cadherin expression were independent prognostic factors for PFS (P = 0.046 and 
P = 0.001, respectively) and only loss of E-cadherin expression for the OS (P <
0.001). We also demonstrated that almost 60% (16/28) of patients with
Twist-positive expression were current smokers at the time of the diagnosis,
corroborating the fact that smoking modulates the expression of EMT markers
including Twist.
CONCLUSION: Positive Twist expression may be a useful prognostic marker for
patients with bladder cancer. Its expression seems to be correlated to the
tobacco status of the patients.

Recent advances in molecular genetics have led to a better understanding of the
role of specific genes such as fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and Twist
in cranial bone formation. Specifically, the analysis of osteoblast abnormalities
induced by FGFR2 and Twist genetic mutations inducing craniosynostosis in humans 
has provided some insights into the role of these genes in the premature cranial 
suture formation in syndromic craniosynostosis. This also led to a better
understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control osteoblast
biology and pathology in humans. In this review paper, we summarize the effects
of FGFR2 and Twist genetic mutations resulting in altered osteoblast phenotype
and premature cranial fusion based on our analysis in human syndromic
craniosynostosis.

Craniosynostosis is a very heterogeneous group of disorders, in the etiology of
which genetics play an important role. Chromosomal alterations are important
causative mechanisms of the syndromic forms of craniosynostosis accounting for at
least 10% of the cases. Mutations in 7 genes are unequivocally associated with
mendelian forms of syndromic craniosynostosis: FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, TWIST1,
EFNB1, MSX2 and RAB23. Mutations in 4 other genes, FBN1, POR, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2, 
are also associated with craniosynostosis, but not causing the major clinical
feature of the phenotype or with an apparently low penetrance. The identification
of these genes represented a great advance in the dissection of the genetics of
craniosynostosis in the last 15 years, and today they explain the etiology of
about 30% of the syndromic cases. The paucity in the identification of genes
associated with this defect has partly been due to the rarity of familial cases. 
In contrast, very little is known about the molecular and cellular factors
leading to nonsyndromic forms of craniosynostosis. Revealing the molecular
pathology of craniosynostosis is also of great value for diagnosis, prognosis and
genetic counseling. This chapter will review (1) the chromosomal regions
associated with syndromic forms of the malformation, (2) the genes in which a
large number of mutations have been reported by independent studies (FGFR1,
FGFR2, FGFR3, TWIST1 and EFNB1) and (3) the molecular mechanisms and
genotype-phenotype correlations of such mutations.

Twist1 function in endocardial cushion cell proliferation, migration, and
differentiation during heart valve development.

Center ML 7020, 3333 Burnet Avenue, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.

Twist1 is a bHLH transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation,
migration, and differentiation in embryonic progenitor cell populations and
transformed tumor cells. While much is known about Twist1's function in a variety
of mesenchymal cell types, the role of Twist1 in endocardial cushion cells is
unknown. Twist1 gain and loss of function experiments were performed in primary
chicken endocardial cushion cells in order to elucidate its role in endocardial
cushion development. These studies indicate that Twist1 can induce endocardial
cushion cell proliferation as well as promote endocardial cushion cell migration.
Furthermore, Twist1 is subject to BMP regulation and can induce expression of
cell migration marker genes including Periostin, Cadherin 11, and Mmp2 while
repressing markers of valve cell differentiation including Aggrecan. Previously, 
Tbx20 has been implicated in endocardial cushion cell proliferation and
differentiation, and in the current study, Tbx20 also promotes cushion cell
migration. Twist1 can induce Tbx20 expression, while Tbx20 does not affect Twist1
expression. Taken together, these data indicate a role for Twist1 upstream of
Tbx20 in promoting cell proliferation and migration and repressing
differentiation in endocardial cushion cells during embryonic development.

MSX2 is thought to be a regulator of organ development and a downstream target of
the ras signaling pathway; however, little is known about the role of MSX2 in the
development of pancreatic cancers, most of which harbor a K-ras gene mutation.
Therefore, we examined whether the presence of MSX2 correlates with the malignant
behavior of pancreatic cancer cells. BxPC3 pancreatic cancer cells that stably
overexpress MSX2 showed a flattened and scattered morphology accompanied by a
change in localization of E-cadherin and beta-catenin from membrane to cytoplasm.
Cell proliferation rate, cell migration, and anchorage-independent cell growth
were enhanced in MSX2-expressing cells. Injection of MSX2-expressing cells into
the pancreas of nude mice resulted in a significant increase in liver metastases 
and peritoneal disseminations compared with injection of control cells.
Microarray analysis revealed a significant induction of Twist 1 expression in
cells that express MSX2. When MSX2 was inactivated in pancreatic cancer cells
following transfection with an MSX2-specific small interfering RNA, Twist 1 was
down-regulated. Immunohistochemistry of human pancreatic carcinoma tissue
revealed that MSX2 was frequently expressed in cancer cells, and that increased
expression of MSX2 significantly correlated with higher tumor grade, vascular
invasion, and Twist 1 expression. These data indicate that MSX2 plays a crucial
role in pancreatic cancer development by inducing changes consistent with
epithelial to mesenchymal transition through enhanced expression of Twist 1.

The connective tissue of the human tooth arises from cells that are derived from 
the cranial neural crest and, thus, are termed as "ectomesenchymal cells." Here, 
cells being located in a pad-like tissue adjacent to the apex of the developing
tooth, which we designated the third molar pad, were separated by the
microexplant technique. When outgrowing from the explant, dental neural
crest-derived progenitor cells (dNC-PCs) adhered to plastic, proliferated
steadily, and displayed a fibroblast-like morphology. At the mRNA level, dNC-PCs 
expressed neural crest marker genes like Sox9, Snail1, Snail2, Twist1, Msx2, and 
Dlx6. Cytofluorometric analysis indicated that cells were positive for CD49d
(alpha4 integrin), CD56 (NCAM), and PDGFRalpha, while negative for CD31, CD34,
CD45, and STRO-1. dNC-PCs could be differentiated into neurogenic, chondrogenic, 
and osteogenic lineages and were shown to produce bone matrix in athymic mice.
These results demonstrate that human third molar pad possesses neural
crest-derived cells that represent multipotent stem/progenitor cells. As a rather
large amount of dNC-PCs could be obtained from each single third molar, cells may
be used to regenerate a wide range of tissues within the craniofacial region of
humans.

Short interfering RNA directed against TWIST, a novel zinc finger transcription
factor, increases A549 cell sensitivity to cisplatin via MAPK/mitochondrial
pathway.

Previous reports have implicated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as a
major cause of cancer. TWIST, a novel zinc finger transcription factor, was
suggested to be an important inducer of EMT and therefore be involved in
different phases of tumorigenicity. However, whether TWIST suppression could
increase chemosensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agent remains
unclear. In the present study, we utilized RNA interference to knockdown TWIST
expression in A549 cells and further assessed the cell viability and apoptosis as
well as possible MAPKs and mitochondrial pathways. The data showed that TWIST
depletion significantly sensitized A549 cells to cisplatin by inducing activation
of JNK/mitochondrial pathway but not ERK and p-38 pathways, suggesting critical
roles of TWIST in A549 cell chemoresistance to cisplatin and raising the
possibility of TWIST depletion as a promising approach to lung cancer therapy.

Stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) transcription
complex, caused by intratumoural hypoxia, promotes tumour progression and
metastasis, leading to treatment failure and mortality in different types of
human cancers. The transcription factor TWIST is a master regulator of
gastrulation and mesoderm-specification and was implicated recently as an
essential mediator of cancer metastasis. Notably, HIF-1alpha- and TWIST-null mice
show similarities in their phenotypes. Here, we have shown that hypoxia or
overexpression of HIF-1alpha promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
metastastic phenotypes. We also found that HIF-1 regulates the expression of
TWIST by binding directly to the hypoxia-response element (HRE) in the TWIST
proximal promoter. However, siRNA-mediated repression of TWIST in
HIF-1alpha-overexpressing or hypoxic cells reversed EMT and metastastic
phenotypes. Co-expression of HIF-1alpha, TWIST and Snail in primary tumours of
patients with head and neck cancers correlated with metastasis and the worst
prognosis. These results provide evidence of a key signalling pathway involving
HIF-1alpha and TWIST that promotes metastasis in response to intratumoural
hypoxia.

AIM: To characterise expression of known E-cadherin repressors; Snail, Slug and
Twist in the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: E-cadherin, Slug, Snail and Twist mRNA expression in Barrett's
metaplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma specimens was examined by real-time
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Semi-quantitative
immunohistochemistry was used to examine cellular localisation and protein
levels. The effect of Slug on epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers was
examined by transfection of Slug into an adenocarcinoma line OE33.
RESULTS: Cellular localisation of Slug in Barrett's metaplasia was largely
cytoplasmic whilst in adenocarcinoma it was nuclear. Semi-quantitative analysis
indicated that Slug was more abundant in adenocarcinoma compared to matched
Barrett's metaplastic specimens. Snail and Twist were expressed in adenocarcinoma
but were cytoplasmic in location and not induced compared to Barrett's mucosa.
These observations were supported by mRNA studies where only Slug mRNA was shown 
to be over-expressed in adenocarcinoma and inversely correlated to E-cadherin
expression. Overexpression of Slug in OE33 mediated E-cadherin repression and
induced the mesenchymal markers vimentin and fibronectin.
CONCLUSION: Progression to adenocarcinoma is associated with increased Slug
expression and this may represent a mechanism of E-cadherin silencing.

Metastasis, the foremost cause of mortality in cancer patients, is increasingly
recognized as a coordinated biological process. The multistep process of
metastasis posts difficulty in studying its mechanism and molecular basis. Recent
works have shown that the basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional factor Twist and
the serine/threonine kinase AKT play pivotal roles in tumor development and
progression. Our recent study has shown that AKT2 is a transcriptional regulatory
target of Twist and acts downstream of Twist to promote cancer cell survival,
migration, and invasion. Functional convergence of Twist and AKT2 underscores the
importance of this signaling pathway in tumor development and progression and as 
a potential therapeutic target.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS), also known as acrocephalosyndactyly III, is an
autosomal dominant hereditary disorder characterized by craniofacial and limb
anomalies. SCS is generally caused by mutations in the TWIST gene, but several
7p21.3 microdeletions involving the entire gene have also been described. The
patient reported here presented with craniosynostosis, ptosis, brachydactyly and 
syndactyly of toes. Standard lymphocyte karyotype showed a de novo apparently
balanced but complex constitution with a translocation between the short arms of 
chromosomes 2 and 7 and an insertion of the 7(q21.3q22) band in the short arm of 
the same chromosome 7. Interestingly, array CGH displayed a unique 690 kb
deletion in 7p21.3 involving the TWIST gene, consistent with the phenotype. This 
case illustrates the important contribution of array CGH to identification of
complex chromosomal rearrangements.

In order to investigate the possibility of overexpression of Twist in primary
liver cancer (PLC), the Twist expression was detected by using
immunohistochemical analysis and RT-PCR assay in 45 patients with PLC. Control
tissues were obtained from 9 patients with liver hemangioma. It was found that in
36 (80.0%) out of 45 PLC patients, cancerous regions showed positive cytoplasm
and nucleus staining for Twist with a diffuse pattern. In noncancerous adjacent
areas and control liver tissues, the expression of Twist was 57.8% and 22.2%
respectively. The results of RT-PCR assay revealed that the expression of Twist
was stronger in the cancerous tissues than that in the noncancerous adjacent
tissues. It was suggested that the expression of Twist was up-regulated in PLC,
which play an important role in the progression of PLC.

Hypophosphatasia is a rare inherited disorder characterized by defective skeletal
mineralization and low alkaline phosphatase activities in the serum. The genetic 
cause of hypophosphatasia is believed related to inactivating mutations in the
TNSALP gene, encoding tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase. Another rare
inheritable disease, Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, leads to premature fusion of the
cranial sutures caused by heterozygous mutations of the human TWIST1 gene.
Because the two disorders apparently are not genetically related (only reported
individually) yet both involve defective skeletal formation, we believe it is
important to report our findings on a patient harboring mutations of TNSALP and
TWIST1.

Molecular mechanism of transforming growth factor-beta-mediated inhibition of
growth arrest and differentiation in a myoblast cell line.

(1)Human Gene Sciences Center, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) has been demonstrated to inhibit
myogenesis in myoblasts. Here we report that transcriptional upregulation of
p21(WAF1/Cip1) and muscle creatinine kinase (MCK) genes in C2C12 cells, which are
associated with growth arrest at the G1 phase and representative
cell-lineage-specific expression during myogenesis, was inhibited by TGF-beta
treatment. C2C12 cells expressed TWIST2, but not TWIST1, which was downregulated 
in myogenic differentiation in response to low-serum cultures. We further found
that TGF-beta prevented differentiation-associated downregulation of TWIST2
transcription, resulting in maintaining TWIST2 mRNA expression as high as that in
growing C2C12 cells. Ectopic TWIST2 suppressed the p21 and MCK promoters
activated by the exogenous addition of E2A and MyoD and this inhibitory effect of
TWIST2 was cancelled by the introduction of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against
TWIST2. On the other hand, TWIST2 shRNA failed to recover endogenous promoter
activities from TGF-beta-mediated repression. The results clearly indicate that
TGF-beta inhibits G1 arrest and maintains TWIST2 expression in C2C12 cells. Our
data however suggest that the TGF-beta signaling pathway may not involve TWIST2
to inhibit p21 and MCK expression.

Paleontologists and neontologists have long looked to development to understand
the homologies of the dermal bones that form the "armor" of turtles, crocodiles, 
armadillos, and other vertebrates. This study shows molecular evidence supporting
a dermomyotomal identity for the mesenchyme of the turtle carapacial ridge. The
mesenchyme of the carapace primordium expresses Pax3, Twist1, Dermo1, En1, Sim1, 
and Gremlin at early stages and before overt ossification expresses Pax1. A
hypothesis is proposed that this mesenchyme forms dermal bone in the turtle
carapace. A comparison of regulatory gene expression in the primordia of the
turtle carapace, the vertebrate limb, and the vertebral column implies the
exaptation of key genetic networks in the development of the turtle shell. This
work establishes a new role for this mesodermal compartment and highlights the
importance of changes in genetic regulation in the evolution of morphology.

Twist promotes tumor cell growth through YB-1 expression.

YB-1 controls gene expression through both transcriptional and translational
mechanisms and is involved in various biological activities such as brain
development, chemoresistance, and tumor progression. We have previously shown
that YB-1 is overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant cells and is involved in
resistance against DNA-damaging agents. Structural analysis of the YB-1 promoter 
reveals that several E-boxes may participate in the regulation of YB-1
expression. Here, we show that the E-box-binding transcription factor Twist is
overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant cells and that YB-1 is a target gene of
Twist. Silencing of either Twist or YB-1 expression induces G(1) phase cell cycle
arrest of tumor cell growth. Significantly, reexpression of YB-1 led to increase 
colony formation when Twist expression was down-regulated by small interfering
RNA. However, cotransfection of Twist expression plasmid could not increase
colony formation when YB-1 expression was down-regulated. Collectively, these
data suggest that YB-1 is a major downstream target of Twist. Both YB-1 and Twist
expression could induce tumor progression, promoting cell growth and driving
oncogenesis in various cancers. Thus, both YB-1 and Twist may represent promising
molecular targets for cancer therapy.

Transcriptional silencing by CpG island hypermethylation is a potential mechanism
for the inactivation of tumor-related genes. Virtually, all types of human
cancers show CpG island hypermethylation, and gastric carcinoma (GC) is one of
the tumors with a high frequency of aberrant CpG island hypermethylation. In this
study, we prescreened DNA methylation of 170 CpG island loci in a training set of
8 paired GC and GC-associated non-neoplastic mucosae (GCN) using MethyLight
technology and selected 27 DNA methylation markers showing higher methylation
frequency or level in GC than in GCN. These markers were then analyzed in a
tester set of 25 paired GC and GCN and 27 chronic gastritis (CG) from non-cancer 
patients to generate their DNA methylation profiles. We identified 17 novel
methylation markers in GC, including SFRP4, SEZ6L, TWIST1, BCL2, KL, TERT,
SCGB3A1, IGF2, GRIN2B, SFRP5, DLEC1, HOXA1, CYP1B1, SMAD9, MT1G, NR3C1, and
HOXA10. Of the 27 selected CpG island loci, 23 were methylated in GC, GCN, and CG
and the remainder four loci (DLEC1, CHFR, CYP1B1, and NR3C1) were only methylated
in GC. We found that the number of methylated loci was significantly higher in GC
than in GCN or CG and that Helicobacter pylori infection was strongly associated 
with aberrant CpG island hypermethylation in CG. Hypermethylation was more
prevalent in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive GC than in EBV-negative GC and in 
diffuse-type GC than in intestinal-type GC. Through our large-scale screening of 
170 CpG island loci, we found 17 new DNA methylation markers of GC, which may
serve as useful markers that may identify a distinct subset of GC.

Non syndromic cleft lip and palate (CLP) is the most frequent human malformation.
CLP is of complex inheritance and at least twenty contributing chromosomal
regions have been identified by linkage studies. On the other hand, mutations in 
several genes such as TWIST and FGFR2 result in syndromic cranio-facial
abnormalities of highly variable range. It is our hypothesis that some mutations 
at TWIST might contribute to CLP in absence of other dysmorphic features. Thus,
DNA biopsies of patients with non syndromic CLP are collected and prepared to
search for allelic variations or mutations at TWIST. This study should contribute
to improve the classification of facial malformations relative to gene, to help
to a better understanding of the inheritance pattern of this pathology, to help
to genetic counselling for some cases aiming at the prevention of genetic
disease. This project is based on a close cooperation between the Orthodontic
Department, the Paediatric Surgery Department and the Center for Clinical
Investigation (University Hospital in Strasbourg), in a joint project with an
academic research laboratory, expert in molecular biology and genetics.

cancer.

Twist is a basic helix loop helix protein that plays a role both in human
development and in cancer biogenesis. While characterizing the effects of Twist
on breast epithelial cell transformation, we identified E-cadherin as a target
gene that is down-regulated by Twist. In this study, we demonstrate that Twist
can transcriptionally repress E-cadherin in breast cancer cells. Using transient 
promoter assays, we show that Twist can down-regulate E-cadherin promoter
activity by up to two folds. This is further supported by immunoblot analyses
which indicates that over-expression of Twist decreases E-cadherin protein levels
in breast cancer cell lines. Subsequently, chromatin immunoprecipitation
performed on MCF-7/Twist and Hs578 T (high level of endogenous Twist expression) 
confirmed Twist binding to the E-cadherin promoter. Finally, the functional
relevance of this regulation was verified by quantitative real-time PCR and
immunohistochemistry on a cohort of breast cancer samples.

Sezary syndrome (SS) is a rare, aggressive CD4+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL);
molecular traits differentiating SS from nonleukemic mycosis fungoides (MF) and
from inflammatory skin diseases (ID) are not sufficiently characterized.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 10 SS patients and 10 healthy donors
(HD) were screened by Affymetrix U133Plus2.0 chips for differential gene
expression. Ten candidate genes were confirmed by qRT-PCR to be significantly
overexpressed in CD4+ T cells of SS versus HD/ID. For easier clinical use, these 
genes were re-analyzed in PBMC; qRT-PCR confirmed five novel (DNM3, IGFL2, CDO1, 
NEDD4L, KLHDC5) and two known genes (PLS3, TNFSF11) to be significantly
overexpressed in SS. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that CDO1 and
DNM3 had the highest discriminative power in combination. Upon comparison of PBMC
and skin samples of SS versus MF, CDO1 and DNM3 were found upregulated only in
SS. Using anti-CDO1 antisera, differential expression of CDO1 protein was
confirmed in SS CD4+ T cells. Interestingly, DNM3 and CDO1 are known to be
regulated by SS-associated transcription factors TWIST1 and c-myb, respectively. 
Furthermore, CDO1 catalyzes taurine synthesis and taurine inhibits apoptosis and 
promotes chemoprotection. In summary, CDO1 and DNM3 may improve the diagnosis of 
SS and open novel clues to its pathogenesis.

Research, Institute of Cancer Biology, Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen,

Aberrant methylation of promoter CpG islands is causally linked with a number of 
inherited syndromes and most sporadic cancers, and may provide valuable
diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. In this report, we describe an approach to 
simultaneous analysis of multiple CpG islands, where methylation-specific
oligonucleotide probes are joined by ligation and subsequently amplified by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) when hybridized in juxtaposition on
bisulfite-treated DNA. Specificity of the ligation reaction is achieved by (i)
using probes containing CpGpCpG (for methylated sequences) or CpApCpA (for
unmethylated sequences) at the 3' ends, (ii) including three or more probes for
each target, and (iii) using a thermostable DNA ligase. The external probes carry
universal tails to allow amplification of multiple ligation products using a
common primer pair. As proof-of-principle applications, we established duplex
assays to examine the FMR1 promoter in individuals with fragile-X syndrome and
the SNRPN promoter in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome or Angelman
syndrome, and a multiplex assay to simultaneously detect hypermethylation of
seven genes (ID4, APC, RASSF1A, CDH1, ESR1, HIN1 and TWIST1) in breast cancer
cell lines and tissues. These data show that ligation of oligonucleotide probes
hybridized to bisulfite-treated DNA is a simple and cost-effective approach to
analysis of CpG methylation.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly invasive tumor characterized by
vigorous neovascularization. The purpose of this study is to examine the
expression of Twist, a highly conserved bHLH transcription factor that is known
to promote EMT, and evaluate its effect on tumor angiogenesis and metastasis of
HCC. The mRNA expression of Twist, VEGF, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin was
determined by Real-Time RT-PCR in 30 pairs of hepatocellular carcinomas and
matched non-cancerous tissues. Immunohistochemistry was carried out to analyze
the protein expression of Twist, VEGF, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin in 40
hepatocellular carcinoma cases. The staining of endothelial cells for CD34 was
used to evaluate the MVD. We found that Twist mRNA and protein were both
increased in HCC as compared to non-cancerous tissues. The HCC specimens showing 
positive Twist expression had a higher microvessel density than those without
Twist expression. And up-regulated Twist protein was significantly associated
with intrahepatic and extrahepatic metastasis (p=0.048 and P=0.039 respectively).
In addition, patients with Twist expression had poor prognosis. We also found
that the expression of Twist positively correlated with up-regulation of VEGF and
N-cadherin (P=0.002 and p=0.016 respectively), but not with downregulation of
E-cadherin in HCC. Our results demonstrate that Twist may play an important role 
in the angiogenesis and metastasis of HCC. Twist expression may become a
potential novel prognostic factor for the disease survival of HCC.

BACKGROUND: Although early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is considered
a potentially curable disease following complete resection, patients have a wide 
spectrum of survival according to stage (IB, II, IIIA). Within each stage, gene
expression profiles can identify patients with a higher risk of recurrence. We
hypothesized that altered mRNA expression in nine genes could help to predict
disease outcome: excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1), myeloid zinc
finger 1 (MZF1) and Twist1 (which regulate N-cadherin expression), ribonucleotide
reductase subunit M1 (RRM1), thioredoxin-1 (TRX1), tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 
(Tdp1), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), BRCA1, and the human homolog 
of yeast budding uninhibited by benzimidazole (BubR1).
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (RT-QPCR) in frozen lung cancer tissue specimens from
126 chemonaive NSCLC patients who had undergone surgical resection and evaluated 
the association between gene expression levels and survival. For validation, we
used paraffin-embedded specimens from 58 other NSCLC patients. A strong
inter-gene correlation was observed between expression levels of all genes except
NFAT. A Cox proportional hazards model indicated that along with disease stage,
BRCA1 mRNA expression significantly correlated with overall survival (hazard
ratio [HR], 1.98 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11-6]; P = 0.02). In the
independent cohort of 58 patients, BRCA1 mRNA expression also significantly
correlated with survival (HR, 2.4 [95%CI, 1.01-5.92]; P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of BRCA1 mRNA was strongly associated with poor
survival in NSCLC patients, and the validation of this finding in an independent 
data set further strengthened this association. Since BRCA1 mRNA expression has
previously been linked to differential sensitivity to cisplatin and
antimicrotubule drugs, BRCA1 mRNA expression may provide additional information
for customizing adjuvant antimicrotubule-based chemotherapy, especially in stage 
IB, where the role of adjuvant chemotherapy has not been clearly demonstrated.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the number one cancer killer of both men and women in 
the United States. Three quarters of lung cancer patients are diagnosed with
regionally or distantly disseminated disease; their 5-year survival is only 15%. 
DNA hypermethylation at promoter CpG islands shows great promise as a
cancer-specific marker that would complement visual lung cancer screening tools
such as spiral CT, improving early detection. In lung cancer patients, such
hypermethylation is detectable in a variety of samples ranging from tumor
material to blood and sputum. To date the penetrance of DNA methylation at any
single locus has been too low to provide great clinical sensitivity. We used the 
real-time PCR-based method MethyLight to examine DNA methylation quantitatively
at twenty-eight loci in 51 primary human lung adenocarcinomas, 38 adjacent
non-tumor lung samples, and 11 lung samples from non-lung cancer patients.
RESULTS: We identified thirteen loci showing significant differential DNA
methylation levels between tumor and non-tumor lung; eight of these show highly
significant hypermethylation in adenocarcinoma: CDH13, CDKN2A EX2, CDX2, HOXA1,
OPCML, RASSF1, SFPR1, and TWIST1 (p-value << 0.0001). Using the current tissue
collection and 5-fold cross validation, the four most significant loci (CDKN2A
EX2, CDX2, HOXA1 and OPCML) individually distinguish lung adenocarcinoma from
non-cancer lung with a sensitivity of 67-86% and specificity of 74-82%. DNA
methylation of these loci did not differ significantly based on gender, race, age
or tumor stage, indicating their wide applicability as potential lung
adenocarcinoma markers. We applied random forests to determine a good classifier 
based on a subset of our loci and determined that combined use of the same four
top markers allows identification of lung cancer tissue from non-lung cancer
tissue with 94% sensitivity and 90% specificity.
CONCLUSION: The identification of eight CpG island loci showing highly
significant hypermethylation in lung adenocarcinoma provides strong candidates
for evaluation in patient remote media such as plasma and sputum. The four most
highly ranked loci, CDKN2A EX2, CDX2, HOXA1 and OPCML, which show significant DNA
methylation even in stage IA tumor samples, merit further investigation as some
of the most promising lung adenocarcinoma markers identified to date.

A potential dichotomous role of ATF3, an adaptive-response gene, in cancer
development.

Author information:

USA.

Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is a member of the ATF/cyclic AMP
response element-binding family of transcription factors. We present evidence
that ATF3 has a dichotomous role in cancer development. By both gain- and
loss-of-function approaches, we found that ATF3 enhances apoptosis in the
untransformed MCF10A mammary epithelial cells, but protects the aggressive
MCF10CA1a cells and enhances its cell motility. Array analyses indicated that
ATF3 upregulates the expression of several genes in the tumor necrosis factor
pathway in the MCF10A cells but upregulates the expression of several genes
implicated in tumor metastasis, including TWIST1, fibronectin (FN)-1, plasminogen
activator inhibitor-1, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, caveolin-1 and Slug,
in the MCF10CA1a cells. We present evidence that ATF3 binds to the endogenous
promoters and regulates the transcription of the TWIST1, FN-1, Snail and Slug
genes. Furthermore, conditioned medium experiments indicated that ATF3 has a
paracrine/autocrine effect, consistent with its upregulation of genes encoding
secreted factors. Finally, ATF3 gene copy number is >2 in approximately 80% of
the breast tumors examined (N=48) and its protein level is elevated in
approximately 50% of the tumors. These results provided a correlative argument
that it is advantageous for the malignant cancer cells to express ATF3,
consistent with its oncogenic roles suggested by the MCF10CA1a cell data.

TWIST1 encodes a transcription factor that contains a highly conserved basic
helix-loop-helix DNA-binding domain and a WR motif. We have isolated a
full-length complementary DNA of the zebrafish ortholog of TWIST1 and determined 
its genomic organization. Inter-species comparisons reveal a remarkable degree of
conservation at the gene structure, nucleotide, and predicted peptide levels
across large evolutionary distances. Using reverse-transcription polymerase chain
reaction analysis and in situ hybridization analyses of whole mount and
cryosectioned zebrafish embryos, we detected maternal twist1 transcript in the
zygote. During somitogenesis, twist1 transcripts were detected in the
intermediate mesoderm from the 2-somite to 18-somite stages, followed by
expression in the somites from the 5-somite stage to the 24-somite stage. Also,
beginning at the two-somite stage, twist1 expression was observed in head
mesenchyme and, subsequently, in neural crest-derived pharyngeal arches as the
embryo developed. At the 24-hpf stage, twist1 transcripts were also observed in
the ventral tail-bud region. These observations are consistent with a role for
twist1 in craniofacial, vertebral, and early renal development.

BACKGROUND: Twist, a basic helix--loop-helix transcription factor, has been
reported to be associated with the development and progression of human cancer.
We examined the distribution and expression of Twist in cervical cancer to
examine its clinical significance.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the distribution and expression of Twist in 101
cervical cancer specimens and determined the association between their expression
and the clinico-pathological features observed, including patient outcome.
RESULTS: Of the 101 specimens, 55 cases were negative for Twist
immuno-expression, whereas 46 were positive. When categorized into negative
versus positive expression, Twist was not associated with any of the
clinico-pathological parameters examined. Positive Twist expression significantly
predicted poorer overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) when
compared with negative expression (P < 0.01). In the multivariate analyses,
positive Twist expression was an independent prognostic factor for OS (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data imply that positive Twist expression seems to be a useful
marker in patients with cervical cancer likely to have an unfavorable clinical
outcome.

Irradiation-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related to invasive
potential in endometrial carcinoma cells.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nagoya University Graduate School of 
Medicine, Tsurumai-cho 65, Showa-ku, Nagoya 466-8550, Japan.

OBJECTIVE: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process whereby cells
acquire molecular alterations that facilitate cell motility and invasion. In this
study, we hypothesized that ionizing irradiation would cause endometrial
carcinoma cells (HEC1A) to undergo an increase of motility related to EMT.
METHODS: We investigated the effect of ionizing irradiation on HEC1A cell
migration. Furthermore, we examined whether this enhanced invasiveness was
associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and Twist siRNA
transfections effects in ionizing irradiation-induced HEC1A cell migratory
capacity.
RESULTS: Ionizing irradiation leads to HEC1A cell phenotypic changes with EMT:
spindle-cell shape, loss of polarity, intercellular separation, and pseudopodia
formation. Ionizing irradiation leads to a 2-fold increase in HEC1A cell
migration. In immunofluorescence staining of HEC1A cell, the expression of Twist,
an organizer of EMT, increased by ionizing irradiation. Additionally, the
irradiation-induced HEC1A cell invasion was inhibited by Twist siRNA
transfections.
CONCLUSIONS: This report suggested that the inhibitory effect of cell invasion
through targeting Twist may represent a new approach for improving the
therapeutic strategy.

Microarray gene expression profiling of osteoarthritic bone suggests altered bone
remodelling, WNT and transforming growth factor-beta/bone morphogenic protein
signalling.

Road, Adelaide, South Australia, 5000, Australia.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by alterations to subchondral bone as well
as articular cartilage. Changes to bone in OA have also been identified at sites 
distal to the affected joint, which include increased bone volume fraction and
reduced bone mineralization. Altered bone remodelling has been proposed to
underlie these bone changes in OA. To investigate the molecular basis for these
changes, we performed microarray gene expression profiling of bone obtained at
autopsy from individuals with no evidence of joint disease (control) and from
individuals undergoing joint replacement surgery for either degenerative hip OA, 
or fractured neck of femur (osteoporosis [OP]). The OP sample set was included
because an inverse association, with respect to bone density, has been observed
between OA and the low bone density disease OP. Compugen human 19K-oligo
microarray slides were used to compare the gene expression profiles of OA,
control and OP bone samples. Four sets of samples were analyzed, comprising 10
OA-control female, 10 OA-control male, 10 OA-OP female and 9 OP-control female
sample pairs. Print tip Lowess normalization and Bayesian statistical analyses
were carried out using linear models for microarray analysis, which identified
150 differentially expressed genes in OA bone with t scores above 4. Twenty-five 
of these genes were then confirmed to be differentially expressed (P < 0.01) by
real-time PCR analysis. A substantial number of the top-ranking differentially
expressed genes identified in OA bone are known to play roles in osteoblasts,
osteocytes and osteoclasts. Many of these genes are targets of either the WNT
(wingless MMTV integration) signalling pathway (TWIST1, IBSP, S100A4, MMP25,
RUNX2 and CD14) or the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta/bone morphogenic
protein (BMP) signalling pathway (ADAMTS4, ADM, MEPE, GADD45B, COL4A1 and FST).
Other differentially expressed genes included WNT (WNT5B, NHERF1, CTNNB1 and
PTEN) and TGF-beta/BMP (TGFB1, SMAD3, BMP5 and INHBA) signalling pathway
component or modulating genes. In addition a subset of genes involved in
osteoclast function (GSN, PTK9, VCAM1, ITGB2, ANXA2, GRN, PDE4A and FOXP1) was
identified as being differentially expressed in OA bone between females and
males. Altered expression of these sets of genes suggests altered bone
remodelling and may in part explain the sex disparity observed in OA.

Mammalian Twist1, a master regulator in development and a key factor in
tumorigenesis, is known to repress transcription by several mechanisms and is
therefore considered to mediate its function mainly through inhibition. A role of
Twist1 as transactivator has also been reported but, so far, without providing a 
mechanism for such an activity. Here we show that heterodimeric complexes of
Twist1 and E12 mediate E-box-dependent transcriptional activation. We identify a 
novel Twist1 transactivation domain that coactivates together with the less
potent E12 transactivation domain. We found three specific residues in the highly
conserved WR domain to be essential for the transactivating function of murine
Twist1 and suggest an alpha-helical structure of the transactivation domain.

The molecular mechanisms that maintain the equilibrium of odontoblast progenitor 
cells in dental pulp are unknown. Here we tested whether homeostasis in dental
pulp is modulated by Twist-1, a nuclear protein that partners with Runx2 during
osteoblast differentiation. Our analysis of Twist-1(+/-) mice revealed phenotypic
changes that involved an earlier onset of dentin matrix formation, increased
alkaline phosphatase activity, and pulp stones within the pulp. RT-PCR analyses
revealed Twist-1 expression in several adult organs, including pulp. Decreased
levels of Twist-1 led to higher levels of type I collagen and Dspp gene
expression in perivascular cells associated with the pulp stones. In mice
heterozygous for both Twist-1 and Runx2 inactivation, the phenotype of pulp
stones appeared completely rescued. These findings suggest that Twist-1 plays a
key role in restraining odontoblast differentiation, thus maintaining homeostasis
in dental pulp. Furthermore, Twist-1 functions in dental pulp are dependent on
its interaction with Runx2.

METHODS: A total of 76 cases of archival gastric cancer tissues were
immunohistochemically evaluated for TWIST expression, and its expression was
correlated with clinicopathological parameters. Semi-quantitative reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the mRNA of
TWIST in four gastric cancer cell lines and a normal immortalised gastric
epithelial cell line (GES-1). The expression of TWIST protein in these cell lines
and 14 pairs of fresh gastric carcinoma and adjacent normal tissue samples was
detected by Western blotting.
RESULTS: TWIST expression increased in diffuse-type gastric carcinoma compared
with intestinal-type gastric carcinoma (26/42, 61.9% versus 9/34, 26.5%, p<0.05).
TWIST expression was significantly increased in 35 (46.1%) of the 76 cancers and 
correlated with lymph node metastasis (node positive rate 60.4%; node negative
rate 21.4%; p<0.05). The expression of TWIST protein was higher in 9/14 (64.3%)
fresh cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. The expression of
mRNA and protein of TWIST in gastric cancer cell lines was up-regulated compared 
with that in GES-1.
CONCLUSIONS: TWIST was highly expressed in gastric cancer. Its up-regulation was 
associated with the neoplastic transformation and subsequent development of
gastric cancer. Therefore, TWIST may be a useful prognostic marker and target for
gastric cancer therapy.

Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are highly conserved transcription factors that 
play a crucial role in oxygen homeostasis. Intratumoral hypoxia and genetic
alterations lead to HIF activity, which is a hallmark of solid cancer and is
associated with poor clinical outcome. HIF activity is regulated by an
evolutionary conserved mechanism involving oxygen-dependent HIFalpha protein
degradation. To identify novel components of the HIF pathway, we performed a
genome-wide RNA interference screen in Caenorhabditis elegans, to suppress
HIF-dependent phenotypes, like egg-laying defects and hypoxia survival. In
addition to hif-1 (HIFalpha) and aha-1 (HIFbeta), we identified hlh-8, gska-3 and
spe-8. The hlh-8 gene is homologous to the human oncogene TWIST1. We show that
TWIST1 expression in human cancer cells is enhanced by hypoxia in a
HIF-2alpha-dependent manner. Furthermore, intronic hypoxia response elements of
TWIST1 are regulated by HIF-2alpha, but not HIF-1alpha. These results identify
TWIST1 as a direct target gene of HIF-2alpha, which may provide insight into the 
acquired metastatic capacity of hypoxic tumors.

Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.

Twist1 is the mouse ortholog of TWIST1, the human gene mutated in Saethre-Chotzen
syndrome. Previously, a Twist1 null allele was generated by gene targeting in
mouse embryonic stem cells. Twist1 heterozygous mice develop polydactyly and a
craniofacial phenotype similar to Saethre-Chotzen patients. Mice homozygous for
the Twist1 null allele die around embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) with cranial neural 
tube closure and vascular defects, hindering in vivo studies of Twist1 function
at later stages of development. Here, we report the generation of a Twist1
conditional null allele in mice that functions like a wild-type allele but can be
converted to a null allele upon Cre-mediated recombination.

Epithelial mesenchymal transition during the neoplastic transformation of human
breast epithelial cells by estrogen.

Tiezzi DG(1), Fernandez SV, Russo J.

Author information: 
(1)Breast Cancer Research Laboratory, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA
19111, USA.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in epithelial cells has been indicated as
an important component of neoplastic transformation although, the genetic
mechanism involved in this process has not been defined. The aim of this study
was to evaluate the expression of different genes related to EMT such as
E-cadherin, TGFbeta1, TGFbeta2, h-RAS, TWIST1, SNAIL2, SMAD5, FN1, CEACAM1 and
JAG1 using the in vitro-in vivo model of the estrogen induced cell transformation
developed in our laboratory. The E2-transformed MCF-10F (E2 70) cells and the
tumorigenic cell line C5-A8-T8 (C5-T8) exhibit progressive loss of ductulogenesis
as demonstrated by growth in collagen matrix. MCF-10F cells form ductal
structures while E2 70 cells form solid spherical masses that in histological
sections exhibit a pattern of growth resembling ductal hyperplasia or carcinoma
in situ. The tumorigenic cells C5-T8 did not form structures on collagen
acquiring an invasive pattern with spindle like features. We have observed a
reduction in E-cadherin expression in E2 70 cells and a complete loss in C5-T8
cells. TGFbeta1, TGFbeta2, CEACAM1 and JAG1 were down-regulated in E2 70 and
C5-T8 cells. SMAD5 and h-RAS were up-regulated in the tumorigenic C5-T8 cells
whereas FN1, Twist1 and Snail2 were up-regulated in C5-T8 and down-regulated in
E2 70. We conclude that the loss of expression of TGFbeta1, TGFbeta2, CEACAM1 and
JAG1 are related to ductulogenesis and branching and the overexpression of h-RAS 
with loss of E-cadherin expression and up-modulation of TWIST1, SNAIL2 and SMAD5 
expressions are involved in the EMT modulation.

Dysregulated cell growth or differentiation due to misexpression of developmental
critical factors seems to be a decisive event in oncogenesis. As osteosarcomas
are histologically defined by malignant osteoblasts producing an osteoid
component, we prospected in pediatric osteosarcomas treated with OS94 protocol
the genomic status of several genes implied in ossification processes. In 91
osteosarcoma cases, we focused on the analysis of the fibroblast growth factor
receptors (FGFRs) TWIST, APC, and MET by allelotyping, real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction, gene sequencing, and protein polymorphism study. Our
study supports the frequent role of TWIST, APC, and MET as osteosarcoma markers
(50%, 62%, and 50%, respectively). TWIST and MET were mainly found to be deleted,
and no additional APC mutation was identified. Surprisingly, FGFRs are abnormal
in only < 30%. Most of these factors and their abnormalities seem to be linked
more or less to one clinical subgroup, but the most significant correlation is
the link of MET, TWIST, and APC abnormalities to a worse outcome and their
combination within abnormal tumors. A wider cohort is mandatory to define more
robust molecular conclusions, but these results are to be considered as the
beginning of a more accurate basis for diagnosis, in search of targeted
therapies, and to further characterize prognostic markers.

We describe a female infant with complex craniosynostosis, significant
craniofacial dysmorphism and developmental delay in which a de-novo apparently
balanced translocation between chromosomes 7 and 18 [46,XX,t(7;18)(p15.3;q11.2)] 
was identified. Additional cytogenetic and molecular investigations identified a 
cryptic interstitial 7.6-10.6-Mb deletion of the region between bands 7p21.2 and 
7p21.3 on the derivative chromosome 18. The deletion was of paternal origin and
contained the TWIST1 gene, although her features were not completely
characteristic of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. The phenotype of this patient is
likely further complicated by loss of other genes within the deleted region
and/or disruption of a critical gene(s) at the sites of the breakpoints on
chromosomes 7 and 18. This case illustrates the need for a systematic molecular
study of breakpoints and the surrounding chromosomal regions in patients with
apparently balanced rearrangements and phenotypic abnormalities.

Isolation and molecular profiling of bone marrow micrometastases identifies
TWIST1 as a marker of early tumor relapse in breast cancer patients.

Fleming TP, Aft RL.

Missouri 63110, USA.

PURPOSE: Micrometastatic cells detected in the bone marrow have prognostic
significance in breast cancer. These cells are heterogeneous and likely do not
exhibit uniform biological behavior. To understand the molecular diversity of
disseminated cancer cells that reside in bone marrow, we enriched this cell
population and did global gene expression profiling in the context of a
prospective clinical trial involving women with clinical stage II/III breast
cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Enrichment of TACSTD1 (EpCAM)-expressing cells from bone
marrow of breast cancer patients was achieved using immunomagnetic beads. Gene
expression profiles were compared between enriched cell populations and whole
bone marrow from 5 normal volunteers and 23 breast cancer patients after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Enriched cells from bone marrow samples of
breast cancer patients before treatment or at 1 year follow-up were also analyzed
(total of 87 data sets). The expression of transcripts specifically detected in
enriched cell populations from breast cancer patients was correlated with 1-year 
clinical outcome using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in an independent
cohort of bone marrow samples.
RESULTS: Analysis of EpCAM-enriched bone marrow cells revealed specific
expression of a subgroup of transcripts, including the metastasis regulator,
TWIST1. Most transcripts identified, including TWIST1, were not expressed in
enriched populations of bone marrow from normal volunteers, suggesting that this 
expression profile reflects a signature of breast cancer bone marrow
micrometastases that persist after chemotherapy. In an independent set of bone
marrow samples obtained before any treatment, TWIST1 expression correlated with
early disease relapse.
CONCLUSIONS: Disseminated breast cancer cells present in bone marrow after
chemotherapy possess unique transcriptional signatures. Genes whose expression is
overrepresented in these cell populations, such as TWIST1, may prove to be
excellent markers of early distant relapse in breast cancer patients.

Epithelial to mesenchymal transition: expression of the regulators snail, slug,
and twist in pancreatic cancer.

Hotz B(1), Arndt M, Dullat S, Bhargava S, Buhr HJ, Hotz HG.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Surgery I, Charité-Medical School, Campus Benjamin Franklin,
Berlin, Germany.

PURPOSE: Epithelial to mesenchymal transitions are vital for tumor growth and
metastasis. Several inducers of epithelial to mesenchymal transition are
transcription factors that repress E-cadherin expression, such as Snail, Slug,
and Twist. In this study, we aimed to examine the expression of these
transcription factors in pancreatic cancer.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The expression of Snail, Slug, and Twist was detected by
immunohistochemistry in tissue samples from patients with pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma. Five human pancreatic cancer cell lines (AsPC-1, Capan-1, HPAF-2,
MiaPaCa-2, and Panc-1) were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR, real-time PCR,
and Western blotting. An orthotopic nude mouse model of pancreatic cancer was
applied for in vivo experiments.
RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of human pancreatic cancer tissues showed an
expression of Snail, and 50% of the patients displayed positive expression of
Slug. Twist showed no or only weak expression. Snail expression was higher in
undifferentiated cancer cell lines (MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1) than in more
differentiated cell lines (Capan-1, HPAF-2, AsPC-1). Expression of Slug was
detected in all cell lines with different intensities. Twist was not expressed.
After exposure to hypoxia, the Twist gene was activated in all five pancreatic
cancer cell lines.
CONCLUSIONS: The transcription factors Snail and Slug are expressed in pancreatic
cancer but not in normal tissue, suggesting a role in the progression of human
pancreatic tumors. Twist, activated by hypoxia, may play an important role in the
invasive behavior of pancreatic tumors.

Institute, Milan, Italy.

BACKGROUND: Craniosynostosis, the premature fusion of 1 or more sutures of the
skull, is a common congenital defect, with a prevalence of 1 in 2500 live births.
Untreated progressive craniosynostosis leads to inhibition of brain growth and
increased intracranial and intraorbital pressure. The heterogeneity of clinical
phenotypes and the overlap of the various associated syndromes render the correct
diagnosis of the different craniosynostoses particularly difficult.
METHODS: To identify 10 common mutations in the genes for fibroblast growth
factor receptors 2 and 3 (FGFR2 and FGFR3), we developed a microelectronic
microchip assay that exploited the PCR multiplexing format and coupled it with
serial addressing and probe hybridization on the same pad. For the molecular
characterization of patients who tested negative in the microchip screening, we
also developed conditions for denaturing HPLC (DHPLC) analysis of the most
mutated regions of FGFR2 and FGFR3 and the entire coding region of the TWIST1
gene.
RESULTS: In our cohort of 159 patients with various craniosynostosis syndromes,
mutations were found in 100% of patients with Apert syndrome, 83.3% with Pfeiffer
syndrome, 72.7% with Crouzon syndrome, 50.0% with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, 27.7%
with plagiocephaly, 31.8% with brachicephaly, 20% of complex cases, and 6.9% of
mixed cases. No mutations were found in syndromic cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The combined microchip-DHPLC strategy allows rapid and specific
molecular diagnosis of craniosynostosis and is an effective tool for the medical 
and surgical management of these common congenital anomalies in a newborn or an
infant with a developmental defect of the cranial vault.

Role of p14ARF in TWIST-mediated senescence in prostate epithelial cells.

Kwok WK(1), Ling MT, Yuen HF, Wong YC, Wang X.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Anatomy.

Recently, TWIST, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is suggested to
be an oncogene because of its over-expression in many types of human cancer and
its positive role in promoting cell survival. The aim of this study was to
investigate the role of TWIST on the growth of human epithelial cells. Using two 
immortalized human prostate epithelial cell lines, we demonstrated that
inactivation of TWIST by small RNA technology led to the promotion of cellular
senescence and growth arrest, suggesting that TWIST plays a key role in the
continuous proliferation of immortalized cells. Over-expression of TWIST, in
contrast, resulted in suppression of cellular senescence in response to genotoxic
damage and promotion of cell proliferation with DNA damage accumulation,
indicating that TWIST promotes genomic instability. In addition, we also found
that the TWIST-mediated cellular senescence was regulated through its negative
effect on p14(ARF) and subsequent suppression of MDM2/p53 and Chk1/2 DNA damage
response pathways. Our results suggest that over-expression of TWIST results in
down-regulation of p14(ARF), which leads to the impairment of DNA damage
checkpoint in response to genotoxic stress. This negative effect of TWIST on DNA 
damage response facilitates uncontrolled cell proliferation with genomic
instability and tumorigenesis in non-malignant cells.

University, Ghent, Belgium. peter.decoster@ugent.be

Premature fusion of the calvarial bones at the sutures, or craniosynostosis (CS),
is a relatively common birth defect (1:2000-3000) frequently associated with limb
deformity. Patients with CS may present oral defects, such as cleft soft palate, 
hypodontia, hyperdontia, and delayed tooth eruption, but also unusual
associations of major dental anomalies such as taurodontism, microdontia,
multiple dens invaginatus, and dentin dysplasia. The list of genes that are
involved in CS includes those coding for the different fibroblast growth factor
receptors and a ligand of ephrin receptors, but also genes encoding transcription
factors, such as MSX2 and TWIST. Most of these genes are equally involved in
odontogenesis, providing a pausible explanation for clinical associations of CS
with dental agenesis or tooth malformations. On the basis of the present
knowledge on genes and transcription factors that are involved in craniofacial
morphogenesis, and from dental clinics of CS syndromes, the molecular mechanisms 
that control suture formation and suture closure are expected to play key roles
in patterning events and development of teeth. The purpose of this article is to 
review and merge the recent advances in the field of suture research at the
genetic and cellular levels with those of tooth development, and to apply them to
the dental clinics of CS syndromes. These new perspectives and future challenges 
in the field of both dental clinics and molecular genetics, more in particular
the identification of possible candidate genes involved in both CS and dental
defects, are discussed.

Four twist genes in zebrafish, four expression patterns.

Twist genes code for regulatory bHLH proteins essential for embryonic development
and conserved across the metazoa. There are four genes that constitute the
zebrafish twist family: twist1a, twist1b, twist2--orthologs of the mammalian
twist1 and twist2 genes; and twist3--a gene from a new clade that does not exist 
in mammals. Presented here are their embryonic mRNA expression profiles. The
study extends the known conservation of twist developmental patterns in tetrapods
to the fish, e.g., expression in cephalic neural crest, sclerotome and lateral
plate mesoderm. Some other expression domains are unique, like hypochord and
dorsal aorta; some, like the notochord, may be ancestral patterns retained from
protochordates; and the expression in invaginating/migrating cells may have been 
retained from the jellyfish. Perhaps this is one of the more ancient functions of
twist--conserved from diploblasts to humans--to facilitate cell movement.

Transforming growth factor-beta and Wnt signals regulate chondrocyte
differentiation through Twist1 in a stage-specific manner.

We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the transition between
immature and mature chondrocytes downstream of TGF-beta and canonical Wnt
signals. We used two developmentally distinct chondrocyte models isolated from
the caudal portion of embryonic chick sternum or chick growth plates. Lower
sternal chondrocytes exhibited immature phenotypic features, whereas growth
plate-extracted cells displayed a hypertrophic phenotype. TGF-beta significantly 
induced beta-catenin in immature chondrocytes, whereas it repressed it in mature 
chondrocytes. TGF-beta further enhanced canonical Wnt-mediated transactivation of
the Topflash reporter expression in lower sternal chondrocytes. However, it
inhibited Topflash activity in a time-dependent manner in growth plate
chondrocytes. Our immunoprecipitation experiments showed that TGF-beta induced
Sma- and Mad-related protein 3 interaction with T-cell factor 4 in immature
chondrocytes, whereas it inhibited this interaction in mature chondrocytes.
Similar results were observed by chromatin immunoprecipitation showing that
TGF-beta differentially shifts T-cell factor 4 occupancy on the Runx2 promoter in
lower sternal chondrocytes vs. growth plate chondrocytes. To further determine
the molecular switch between immature and hypertrophic chondrocytes, we assessed 
the expression and regulation of Twist1 and Runx2 in both cell models upon
treatment with TGF-beta and Wnt3a. We show that Runx2 and Twist1 are
differentially regulated during chondrocyte maturation. Furthermore, whereas
TGF-beta induced Twist1 in mature chondrocytes, it inhibited Runx2 expression in 
these cells. Opposite effects were observed upon Wnt3a treatment, which
predominates over TGF-beta effects on these cells. Finally, overexpression of
chick Twist1 in mature chondrocytes dramatically inhibited their hypertrophy.
Together, our findings show that Twist1 may be an important regulator of
chondrocyte progression toward terminal maturation in response to TGF-beta and
canonical Wnt signaling.

Mammals possess reduced ability to regenerate lost tissue, compared with other
vertebrates, which can regenerate through differentiation of precursor cells or
de-differentiation. Mammalian multinucleated myotube formation is a
differentiation process, which arises from the fusion of mononucleated myoblasts 
and is thought to be an irreversible process toward muscle formation. By
overexpressing the Twist gene in terminally differentiated myotubes, we managed
to induce reversal of cell differentiation. More specifically, following
expression of the Twist gene, myotubes underwent morphological changes that
caused them to cleave. This was accompanied by a reduction in the expression of
certain myogenic markers. Interestingly, Twist overexpression also caused a
reduction in the muscle transcription factor MyoD. Further experiments showed an 
increase in the cell cycle entry molecule, cyclin D1 and initiation of DNA
synthesis, due to Twist overexpression. The exploitation of Twist-mediated
reversal of differentiation and the study of its specific mechanism would be
important in order to study mammalian cellular de-differentiation and determine
its potential in muscle regeneration.

Mutations within helix I of Twist1 result in distinct limb defects and variation

Twist1 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor that plays an important role in 
limb development. Haploinsufficiency of Twist1 results in polydactyly via the
inability of Twist1 to antagonistically regulate the related factor Hand2. The
mechanism modulating Twist1-Hand2 antagonism is via phosphoregulation of
conserved threonine and serine residues in helix I of the bHLH domain.
Phosphoregulation alters the dimerization affinities for both proteins. Here we
show that the expression of Twist1 and Twist1 phosphoregulation mutants results
in distinct limb phenotypes in mice. In addition to dimer regulation, Twist1
phosphoregulation affects the DNA binding affinities of Twist1 in a
partner-dependent and cis-element-dependent manner. In order to gain a better
understanding of the specific Twist1 transcriptional complexes that function
during limb morphogensis, we employ a series of Twist1-tethered dimers that
include the known Twist1 partners, E12 and Hand2, as well as a tethered Twist1
homodimer. We show that these dimers behave in a manner similar to monomerically 
expressed bHLH factors and result in distinct limb phenotypes that correlate well
with those observed from the limb expression of Twist1 and Twist1
phosphoregulation mutants. Taken together, this study shows that the Twist1 dimer
affinity for a given partner can modulate the DNA binding affinity and that
Twist1 dimer choice determines phenotypic outcome during limb development.

A dozen years have passed since the first genetic lesion was identified in a
family with craniosynostosis, the premature fusion of the cranial sutures.
Subsequently, mutations in the FGFR2, FGFR3, TWIST1, and EFNB1 genes have been
shown to account for approximately 25% of craniosynostosis, whilst several
additional genes make minor contributions. Using specific examples, we show how
these discoveries have enabled refinement of information on diagnosis, recurrence
risk, prognosis for mental development, and surgical planning. However,
phenotypic variability can present a significant challenge to the clinical
interpretation of molecular genetic tests. In particular, the difficulty of
analyzing the complex interaction of genetic background and prenatal environment 
in determining clinical features, limits the value of identifying low penetrance 
mutations.

Twist genes are essential for embryonic development and are conserved from
jellyfish to human. To study the vertebrate twist family and its evolution, the
entire complement of twist genes was obtained for 9 representative species.
Phylogenetic analysis showed that a single protochordate twist gene was
duplicated at least twice before the teleost-tetrapod split to give rise to 3
ancestral genes, which were further duplicated or deleted, resulting in
fluctuating number of twist paralogs in different vertebrate lineages. To find
whether changes in gene copy number were associated with changes in gene
function, embryonic expression patterns of twist orthologs were evaluated against
the number of twist paralogs in different species. The results showed evidence
for both neo- and subfunctionalization, and, in addition, for loss of an
ancestral regulatory gene. For example, in Xenopus, twist2 was lost, but the
twist1 paralog acquired, and therefore preserved, twist2 function. A general
model is proposed to explain the data. In this process, termed
synfunctionalization, one paralog acquires the expression domain(s) of another.
The merging may lead to function shuffle. Alternatively, it may leave one paralog
redundant and thus subject to deletion--while its function is retained by the
surviving paralog(s). Synfunctionalization is a mechanism that, together with
neo- and subfunctionalization, may work to establish equilibrium in the number of
genes that regulate developmental processes; it may regulate the complexity of
regulatory regions as well as gene copy number and therefore may play a role in

The syndromic craniosynostoses, usually involving multiple sutures, are
hereditary forms of craniosynostosis associated with extracranial phenotypes such
as limb, cardiac, CNS and tracheal malformations. The genetic etiology of
syndromic craniosynostosis in humans is only partially understood. Syndromic
synostosis has been found to be associated with mutations of the fibroblast
growth factor receptor family (FGFR1, -R2, -R3), TWIST1, MSX2, and EFNB1. Apert, 
Pfeiffer, Crouzon, and Jackson-Weiss syndromes are due to gain-of-function
mutations of FGFR2 in either the Ig II-III linker region (Apert) or Ig III
domain. Loss of function mutations of TWIST1 and gain-of-function mutations of
MSX2 lead to Saethre-Chotzen and Boston-type syndromes, respectively. The
mutations in Pfeiffer (FGFR1), Muenke (FGFR3), and Apert syndrome (FGFR2) are
caused by the same amino acid substitution in a highly conserved region of the Ig
II-III linker region of these proteins, which suggests that these receptor
tyrosine kinases have an overlapping function in suture biology. In this review
we will discuss the historical descriptions, current phenotypes and molecular
causes of the more common forms of syndromic craniosynostosis.

We examined the feasibility of using detection of high-risk human papillomavirus 
(HPV) DNA in combination with the presence of aberrantly methylated genes (DAPK1,
RARB, TWIST1, and CDH13) for urine-based cervical cancer screening. Urine samples
from 129 Senegalese women, aged 35 years or older, 110 with (same day)
biopsy-proven cervical neoplasia [cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1
(CIN-1): n = 9; CIN-2-3/carcinoma in situ (CIS): n = 29; invasive cervical cancer
(ICC): n = 72], and 19 without cervical neoplasia on biopsy were examined.
Hypermethylation of at least one of the four genes identified 62% of ICC and 28% 
of CIN-2-3/CIS and was present in only 4% of CIN-1 or normal urines. High-risk
HPV DNA was detected in urine in 70% of those with biopsy-proven ICC, 59% of
those with CIN-2-3/CIS on biopsy, 44% of those with CIN-1 on biopsy, and only 11%
of women negative for cervical neoplasia on biopsy. Urine-based detection of
either high-risk HPV or hypermethylation of any of the four genes identified 84% 
of ICC, 64% of CIN-2-3/CIS, 44% of CIN-1, but only 19% of women negative for
cervical neoplasia. The sensitivity for detection of CIN-2-3/CIS/ICC by high-risk
HPV DNA or aberrant DNA methylation of four genes seems to be comparable to that 
of an exfoliated cervical cytology. This study shows the potential feasibility of
using molecular markers detected in urine for cervical cancer screening.

N-cadherin and fibronectin expression.

Twist, a newly found EMT-inducer, has been reported to be up-regulated in those
of diffuse-type gastric carcinomas with high N-cadherin level. We show here
MKN45, a cell line derived from undifferentiated carcinomas cells, expresses high
levels of Twist. Down-regulation of Twist, using an antisense Twist vector in
MKN45 cells, inhibits cell migration and invasion, companied with a morphologic
changes associated with MET. Suppression of Twist also decreases the expressions 
of N-cadherin and fibronectin, but not of E-cadherin in MKN45. In contrast,
overexpression of Twist in MKN28, a cell line derived from moderate
differentiated carcinomas, results in up-regulation of N-cadherin and
fibronectin, companied with down-regulation of E-cadherin. Taken together, our
results suggest that Twist regulates cell motility and invasion in gastric cancer
cell lines, probably through the N-cadherin and fibronectin production.

    Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2009 Mar;48(3):285-8.

The Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is an autosomal, dominantly inherited
craniosynostosis caused by mutations in the basic helix-loop-helix transcription 
factor gene TWIST1. This syndrome has hitherto not been associated with an
increased risk of cancer. However, recent studies, using a murine breast tumor
model, have shown that Twist may act as a key regulator of metastasis and that
the gene is overexpressed in subsets of sporadic human breast cancers. Here, we
report a novel association between the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and breast
cancer. In 15 Swedish Saethre-Chotzen families, 15 of 29 (52%) women carriers
over the age of 25 had developed breast cancer. At least four patients developed 
breast cancer before 40 years of age, and five between 40 and 50 years of age.
The observed cases with breast cancer (n = 15) are significantly higher than
expected (n = 0.89), which gives a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 16.80
(95% CI 1.54-32.06). Our finding of a high frequency of breast cancer in women
with the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome identifies breast cancer as an important and
previously unrecognized symptom characteristic of this syndrome. The results
strongly suggest that women carriers of this syndrome would benefit from genetic 
counseling and enrolment in surveillance programs including yearly mammography.
Our results also indicate that the TWIST1 gene may be a novel breast cancer
susceptibility gene. Additional studies are, however, necessary to reveal the
mechanism by which TWIST1 may predispose to early onset breast cancer in
Saethre-Chotzen patients.

Upregulation of Twist-1 by NF-kappaB blocks cytotoxicity induced by
chemotherapeutic drugs.

NF-kappaB/Rel transcription factors are central to controlling programmed cell
death (PCD). Activation of NF-kappaB blocks PCD induced by numerous triggers,
including ligand engagement of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) family
receptors. The protective activity of NF-kappaB is also crucial for oncogenesis
and cancer chemoresistance. Downstream of TNF-Rs, this activity of NF-kappaB has 
been linked to the suppression of reactive oxygen species and the
c-Jun-N-terminal-kinase (JNK) cascade. The mechanism by which NF-kappaB inhibits 
PCD triggered by chemotherapeutic drugs, however, remains poorly understood. To
understand this mechanism, we sought to identify unrecognized protective genes
that are regulated by NF-kappaB. Using an unbiased screen, we identified the
basic-helix-loop-helix factor Twist-1 as a new mediator of the protective
function of NF-kappaB. Twist-1 is an evolutionarily conserved target of
NF-kappaB, blocks PCD induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and TNF-alpha in
NF-kappaB-deficient cells, and is essential to counter this PCD in cancer cells. 
The protective activity of Twist-1 seemingly halts PCD independently of
interference with cytotoxic JNK, p53, and p19(ARF) signaling, suggesting that it 
mediates a novel protective mechanism activated by NF-kappaB. Indeed, our data
indicate that this activity involves a control of inhibitory Bcl-2
phosphorylation. The data also suggest that Twist-1 and -2 play an important role
in NF-kappaB-dependent chemoresistance.

Significance of TWIST and E-cadherin expression in the metastatic progression of 
prostatic cancer.

China.

AIM: Development of metastasis is one of the main causes of prostatic
cancer-related death. We have previously found that up-regulation of TWIST, a
highly conserved basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, in prostatic cancer
cells can promote epithelial to mesenchymal transition through down-regulation of
E-cadherin. The present study aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of
TWIST and to correlate TWIST and E-cadherin expression in prostatic cancer
specimens.
METHODS AND RESULTS: TWIST and E-cadherin expression was studied in 115 prostatic
cancer specimens, eight cases of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and 37 cases
of benign prostatic hyperplasia by immunohistochemistry. Increased cytoplasmic
expression of TWIST was associated with malignant transformation of prostatic
epithelium and histological progression of prostatic cancer, while nuclear TWIST 
expression was significant in predicting the metastatic potential of the primary 
prostatic cancer. In addition, high levels of TWIST expression were also
significantly associated with aberrant E-cadherin expression.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that TWIST may serve as a prognostic marker
for high-grade prostatic cancer. In addition, up-regulation of TWIST in
combination with aberrant E-cadherin expression in primary prostatic cancer
specimens may predict development of distal metastatic disease.

signaling.

Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors are known as key regulators
for mesenchymal differentiation. The present study showed that overexpression of 
Twist-1, a bHLH transcription factor, suppresses bone morphogenetic protein
(BMP)-induced osteoblast differentiation, and downregulation of endogenous
Twist-1 enhances BMP signaling. Maximal inhibition of BMP signaling was observed 
when Twist-1 was bound to E47, which markedly enhanced the stability of Twist-1. 
Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Twist-1 formed a complex with Smad4
and histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 in MC3T3-E1 cells stably expressing Twist-1.
With trichostatin, an HDAC inhibitor, osteogenic factors such as alkaline
phosphatase, Runx2 and osteopontin increased. Those results suggested that
Twist-1 inhibited BMP signaling by recruiting HDAC1 to Smad4. Furthermore, the
inhibitory effects of Twist-1 on BMP signaling were overcome by Id1 through
induction of Twist-1 degradation. These findings suggest that Twist-1 can act as 
an inhibitor of BMP signaling, and Id1 can regulate BMP signaling through a
positive feedback loop repressing Twist-1 function. These two molecules may
therefore regulate differentiation of mesenchymal cells into progeny such as
osteoblasts by controlling BMP signaling.

Isolated sagittal and coronal craniosynostosis associated with TWIST box
mutations.

Craniosynostosis, the premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures, affects 1 
in 2,500 live births. Isolated single-suture fusion is most prevalent, with
sagittal synostosis occurring in 1/5,000 live births. The etiology of isolated
(nonsyndromic) single-suture craniosynostosis is largely unknown. In syndromic
craniosynostosis, there is a highly nonrandom pattern of causative autosomal
dominant mutations involving TWIST1 and fibroblast growth factor receptors
(FGFRs). Prior to our study, there were no published TWIST1 mutations in the
anti-osteogenic C-terminus, recently coined the TWIST Box, which binds and
inhibits RUNX2 transactivation. RUNX2 is the principal master switch for
osteogenesis. We performed mutational analysis on 164 infants with isolated,
single-suture craniosynostosis for mutations in TWIST1, the IgIIIa exon of FGFR1,
the IgIIIa and IgIIIc exons of FGFR2, and the Pro250Arg site of FGFR3. We
identified two patients with novel TWIST Box mutations: one with isolated
sagittal synostosis and one with isolated coronal synostosis. Kress et al. [2006]
reported a TWIST Box "nondisease-causing polymorphism" in a patient with isolated
sagittal synostosis. However, compelling evidence suggests that their and our
sequence alterations are pathogenic: (1) a mouse with a mutation of the same
residue as our sagittal synostosis patient developed sagittal synostosis, (2)
mutation of the same residue precluded TWIST1 interaction with RUNX2, (3) each
mutation involved nonconservative amino acid substitutions in highly conserved
residues across species, and (4) control chromosomes lacked TWIST Box sequence
alterations. We suggest that genetic testing of patients with isolated sagittal
or coronal synostosis should include TWIST1 mutational analysis.

Metastasis, the cardinal feature of malignant tumors, is an important clinical
variable in patient prognosis. To understand the basis for metastasis, we
systematically selected for highly invasive cells from breast cancer cell lines, 
MCF7 and MDA-MB-453, with moderate to low invasive ability using Boyden chamber
invasion assay. The four-cycle selected invasive lines, named MCF7-I4 and
MDA-MB-453-I4, respectively, displayed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
and dramatically enhanced invasive ability. EMT changes were corroborated with
decreased level of E-cadherin and increased vimentin, fibronectin, and beta(1)
integrin. Twist, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, and AKT2, a known
proto-oncogene, were found to be elevated in the invasive cells compared with the
parental. Ectopic expression and knockdown of Twist by short interference RNA
resulted in significant increase and reduction, respectively, of AKT2 protein and
mRNA expression. Twist bound to E-box elements on AKT2 promoter and enhanced its 
transcriptional activity. Moreover, silencing AKT2 decreased Twist-promoted
migration, invasion, and paclitaxel resistance. Reintroducing AKT2 largely
rescued the phenotype resulted from knockdown of Twist in I4 cells, suggesting
that AKT2 is a downstream target and functional mediator of Twist. Finally, we
observed a 68.8% correlation of elevated Twist and AKT2 expression in late-stage 
breast cancers as oppose to 13% in early-stage breast cancers. Our study
identifies Twist as a positive transcriptional regulator of AKT2 expression, and 
Twist-AKT2 signaling is involved in promoting invasive ability and survival of
breast cancer cells.

Twist and epithelial-mesenchymal transition are induced by the EBV oncoprotein
latent membrane protein 1 and are associated with metastatic nasopharyngeal
carcinoma.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), an EBV-associated malignancy, is highly
metastatic compared with other head and neck tumors, perhaps because of its viral
link. Here, we show that the principal EBV oncoprotein, latent membrane protein 1
(LMP1), induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via Twist, a master
transcriptional regulator in embryogenesis and newly implicated in metastasis,
which, in turn, are likely to contribute to the highly metastatic character of
NPC. LMP1 could induce EMT and its associated cell motility and invasiveness in a
cell culture model, whereas expression of Twist small interfering RNA reversed
LMP1-induced EMT. In diverse EBV-infected cell lines, expression of Twist
correlates with expression of LMP1. Dominant-negative LMP1 could suppress Twist
expression in EBV-positive cells, whereas LMP1 could induce Twist in EBV-negative
nasopharyngeal cells. LMP1 signals through the nuclear factor-kappaB pathway, and
an IkappaB superrepressor inhibited induction of Twist by LMP1. Finally, in human
NPC tissues, expression of Twist and LMP1 is directly correlated and expression
of Twist is associated with metastasis clinically. These results suggest that
induction of Twist by a human viral oncoprotein LMP1 directly contributes to the 
metastatic nature of NPC.

INTRODUCTION: Female germline BRCA gene mutation carriers are at increased risk
for developing breast cancer. The purpose of our study was to establish whether
healthy BRCA mutation carriers demonstrate an increased frequency of aberrant
gene promoter hypermethylation in ductal lavage (DL) fluid, compared with
predictive genetic test negative controls, that might serve as a surrogate marker
of BRCA1/2 mutation status and/or breast cancer risk.
METHODS: The pattern of CpG island hypermethylation within the promoter region of
a panel of four genes (RAR-beta, HIN-1, Twist and Cyclin D2) was assessed by
methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction using free DNA extracted from DL
fluid.
RESULTS: Fifty-one DL samples from 24 healthy women of known BRCA mutation status
(7 BRCA1 mutation carriers, 12 BRCA2 mutation carriers and 5 controls) were
available for methylation analysis. Eight of 19 (42.1%) BRCA mutation carriers
were found to have at least one hypermethylated gene in the four-gene panel. Two 
BRCA mutation carriers, in whom aberrant methylation was found, also had duct
epithelial cell atypia identified. No hypermethylation was found in DL samples
from 5 negative controls (p = 0.13).
CONCLUSION: We found substantial levels of aberrant methylation, with the use of 
a four-gene panel, in the fluid from the breasts of healthy BRCA mutation
carriers compared with controls. Methylation analysis of free DNA in DL fluid may
offer a useful surrogate marker for BRCA1/2 mutation status and/or breast cancer 
risk. Further studies are required for the evaluation of the specificity and
predictive value of aberrant methylation in DL fluid for future breast cancer
development in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

The majority of human melanomas harbor activating mutations of either N-RAS or
its downstream effector B-RAF, which cause activation of mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase and the 
ERK MAPK cascade. The melanoma-relevant effectors of ERK activation, however, are
largely unknown. In this work, we show that increased ERK activation correlates
strongly with mutational status of N-RAS or B-RAF in 21 melanoma cell lines.
Melanoma lines that were wild-type for RAS/RAF showed low levels of ERK
activation comparable with primary human melanocytes. Through supervised analysis
of RNA expression profiles, we identified 82 genes, including TWIST1, HIF1alpha, 
and IL-8, which correlated with ERK activation across the panel of cell lines and
which decreased with pharmacologic inhibition of ERK activity, suggesting that
they are ERK transcriptional targets in melanoma. Additionally, lines lacking
mutations of N-RAS and B-RAF were molecularly distinct and characterized by p53
inactivation, reduced ERK activity, and increased expression of epithelial
markers. Analysis of primary human melanomas by tissue microarray confirmed a
high correlation among expression of these epithelial markers in a heterogeneous 
sample of 570 primary human tumors, suggesting that a significant frequency of
primary melanomas is of this "epithelial-like" subtype. These results show a
molecularly distinct melanoma subtype that does not require ERK activation or
epithelial-mesenchymal transformation for progression.

Recently, TWIST, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, has been reported
to play a key role in the metastatic progression of several types of human
cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the significance of TWIST
expression in bladder cancer using tissue microassays generated from 226 bladder 
tissue specimens. Using immunohistochemical staining, we studied TWIST expression
levels in nonmalignant bladder tissues (n = 37), primary bladder cancer tissues
(n = 164), and 25 cases of matched lymph node metastatic lesions. The association
between TWIST expression levels and tumor staging and grading, as well as
metastatic potential, was analyzed by statistical analysis. Our results showed
that TWIST protein expression was significantly higher in bladder cancer
specimens compared with nonmalignant tissues (P < .001), indicating its positive 
role in the development of bladder cancer. In addition, increased TWIST
expression levels were associated with advanced-stage and high-grade tumors,
suggesting its involvement in the progression of this cancer. Furthermore, TWIST 
expression was much higher in the metastatic lesion compared with its primary
site (P < .05). More importantly, the increased TWIST expression in bladder
cancer specimens was correlated with decreased membranous expression of
E-cadherin, a cell adhesion molecule that plays a key role in the metastatic
progression of human cancer. Our results demonstrate TWIST as a novel positive
factor in the development and progression of bladder cancer and suggest a marker 
for advanced bladder cancer.

Twist, a novel oncogene, is upregulated in pancreatic cancer: clinical
implication of Twist expression in pancreatic juice.

Despite evidence that Twist, a highly conserved basic helix-loop-helix
transcription factor, is a novel oncogene, there are no reports describing Twist 
expression in pancreatic cancer. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN)
and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) are precursor lesions of
pancreatic cancer. To clarify involvement of Twist expression in pancreatic
cancer, we used quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and 
examined Twist expression in pancreatic cancer, IPMN, and non-neoplastic pancreas
using bulk tissues (11 cancers, 18 IPMNs, and 15 non-neoplastic pancreata),
microdissected cells (cancer from 22 sections, IPMN from 19 sections, PanIN from 
6 sections, and pancreatitis-affected epithelial cells from 14 sections), and
pancreatic juice (16 from cancer, 28 from IPMN, and 17 from pancreatitis). Twist 
expression differed significantly between cancer and IPMN bulk tissues (p <
0.0001) but not between cancer and non-neoplastic tissues. Twist expressions
differed significantly between microdissected cancer cells, IPMN cells, and
pancreatitis-affected cells (all comparisons, p < 0.017). PanIN cells expressed
significantly lower levels of Twist than did IDC cells (p = 0.016). Twist
expression differed significantly between cancer and IPMN juice samples (p =
0.0002) but not between cancer and pancreatitis juice samples. Receiver operation
characteristic curve analyses revealed that measurement of Twist was more useful 
for discriminating cancer from IPMN than from chronic pancreatitis (p = 0.009).
Our results suggest that Twist is involved in tumor progression of pancreatic
cancer and that measurement of Twist in pancreatic juice may be useful to
differentiate pancreatic cancer from nonmalignant neoplasms such as IPMN.

Anti-apoptotic role of TWIST and its association with Akt pathway in mediating
taxol resistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.

TWIST, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, has been reported to be
associated with development and progression of human cancer. Recently, over
expression of TWIST is found in cancer patients with shorter survival and poor
response to chemotherapy. Previously, we found that upregulation of TWIST was
responsible for the development of acquired resistance to taxol in a
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell line, HNE1-T3 (Wang et al., Oncogene,
2004;24:274). In this study, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms 
responsible for the TWIST-mediated taxol resistance. By comparison of the
parental HNE1 and its derivative HNE1-T3 cell lines, we found that the resistance
to taxol in HNE1-T3 cells was associated with suppression of taxol-induced
apoptosis evidenced by decreased expression of Bak and Bax and increased Bcl-2,
as well as inhibition of PARP and caspase cleavage and DNA ladder formation.
However, there was no correlation between taxol sensitivity and alterations on
G2/M cell cycle distribution, suggesting that the TWIST-induced taxol resistance 
is mediated through protection against apoptosis but not mitotic arrest. Analysis
of additional 8 NPC cell lines showed that upregulation of TWIST was associated
with resistance to microtubule disrupting agents, especially taxol, and
inactivation of TWIST through small RNA interference led to increased sensitivity
to taxol-induced cell death. Subsequent studies also demonstrated that the
TWIST-mediated taxol resistance may be regulated through its positive involvement
with the Akt pathway. Our findings suggest an underlying molecular mechanism
responsible for the TWIST-mediated chemodrug resistance and suggest a target for 
overcoming taxol resistance in cancer cells.

cirrhotic tissues.
METHOD: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of the Twist
protein in 26 cases of HCC and paraneoplastic tissue and 10 cases of cirrhotic
tissue. Meanwhile, the Twist mRNA and its protein were detected in 10 HCC tissues
and 10 paraneoplastic tissues by RT-PCR and Western blot. And the expression
differences and clinicopathological significances of the expression of Twist gene
and its protein were analyzed.
RESULTS: The positive rates of the Twist protein in HCC, paraneoplastic and
cirrhotic tissues were 84.6%, 19.2 % and 20.0 %, respectively. The positive rate 
of Twist in HCC was higher than that in paraneoplastic or cirrhosis tissues (P < 
0.05). Compared with in paraneoplastic tissues, the mRNA and protein expression
of Twist were up-regulated in HCC by 2.52 and 2.13 times, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Twist has an inappropriate expression in hepatocellular carcinoma and
it may play an important role in the tumorigenesis and progression of HCC.

TWIST1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, plays critical roles in
embryo development, cancer metastasis and mesenchymal progenitor differentiation.
Little is known about transcriptional regulation of TWIST1 expression. Here we
identified DNA sequences responsible for TWIST1 expression in mesenchymal lineage
cell lines. Reporter assays with TWIST1 promoter mutants defined the -102 to -74 
sequences that are essential for TWIST1 expression in human and mouse mesenchymal
cell lines. Tandem repeats of CCT, but not putative CREB and NF-kappaB sites in
the sequences substantially supported activity of the TWIST1 promoter.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that the DNA sequences with the
CCT repeats formed complexes with nuclear factors, containing, at least, Sp1 and 
Sp3. These results suggest critical implication of the CCT repeats in association
with Sp1 and Sp3 factors in sustaining expression of the TWIST1 gene in
mesenchymal cells.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS) is a craniosynostosis syndrome characterized by
facial and limb abnormalities caused by mutations in the TWIST1 gene on 7p21,
resulting in variable loss of function. The transcription factor TWIST1 has also 
been shown to promote tumor growth and has been linked to the formation of
metastases in breast cancers. One suggestive case of inherited SCS and malignancy
in childhood has been reported previously. Here, we present immunological and
genetic investigations including the determination of a new stop codon mutation
in the TWIST1 gene in SCS associated with malignancy in childhood.

Gene expression response to cisplatin treatment in drug-sensitive and
drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells.

The molecular pathways activated in response to acute cisplatin exposure, as well
as the mechanisms involved in the long-term development of cisplatin-resistant
cancer cells remain unclear. Using whole genome oligonucleotide microarrays, we
have examined the kinetics of gene expression changes in a cisplatin-sensitive
cell line, A2780, and its cisplatin-resistant derivative, ACRP. Both sensitive
and resistant cell lines exhibited a very similar response of p53-inducible genes
as early as 16 h after treatment. This p53 response was further increased at the 
24-h time point. These experiments identify p53 as the main pathway producing a
large-scale transcriptional response after cisplatin treatment in these cells
containing wild-type p53. Consistent with a role for the p53 response in
cisplatin sensitivity, knockdown of the p53 protein with small interfering RNA
led to a twofold decrease in cell survival in the resistant cells. In addition,
our analysis also allowed the identification of several genes that are
differentially expressed between sensitive and resistant cells. These genes
include GJA1 (encoding connexin 43 (Cx43)) and TWIST1, which are highly
upregulated in cisplatin-resistant cells. The importance of Cx43 in drug
resistance was demonstrated through functional analyses, although paradoxically, 
inhibition of Cx43 function in high expressing cells led to an increase in drug
resistance. The pathways important in cisplatin response, as well as the genes
found differentially expressed between cisplatin-resistant and -sensitive cells, 
may represent targets for therapy aimed at reversing drug resistance.

mutations.

Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Despite the similar clinical phenotype of the Saethre-Chotzen
and Muenke craniosynostoses, the 2 syndromes are now genotypically distinct.
Patients with Saethre-Chotzen and Muenke syndromes carry mutations in the TWIST
and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 3 genes, respectively. We sought to 
assess possible ocular phenotypic differences in patients with mutations of
either gene previously grouped according to phenotype only.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed for 21 children with known
mutations of the TWIST (n=10) or the FGFR3 (n=11) genes. Data gathered included
patient sex, age, family craniofacial history, craniofacial and ophthalmic
surgeries, type of strabismus, ptosis, cycloplegic refraction, visual acuity, the
presence of amblyopia, nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO), nystagmus,
hypertelorism, epicanthal fold anomalies, and any ocular structural
abnormalities.
RESULTS: In the TWIST group, ptosis was present in 90%, amblyopia in 70%,
horizontal strabismus in 70%, vertical strabismus in 60%, NLDO in 60%,
astigmatism in 50%, inferior oblique overaction (IOOA) in 40%, hyperopia in 40%, 
myopia in 30%, nystagmus in 30%, and optic nerve findings in 30%. In the FGFR3
group, ptosis was present in 36%, amblyopia in 18%, horizontal strabismus in 55%,
vertical strabismus in 36%, NLDO in 0%, astigmatism in 9%, IOOA in 45%, hyperopia
in 27%, myopia in 18%, nystagmus in 18%, and optic nerve findings in 27%.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with TWIST gene mutations may have more ophthalmic
abnormalities, including more strabismus, ptosis, NLDO, astigmatism, vertical
deviations, and amblyopia compared with patients with FGFR3 gene mutations.

Runx2 inhibits chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy through its expression
in the perichondrium.

Karsenty G.

Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA.

The perichondrium, a structure made of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells
surrounding growth plate cartilage, regulates chondrocyte maturation through
poorly understood mechanisms. Analyses of loss- and gain-of-function models show 
that Twist-1, whose expression in cartilage is restricted to perichondrium,
favors chondrocyte maturation in a Runx2-dependent manner. Runx2, in turn,
enhances perichondrial expression of Fgf18, a regulator of chondrocyte
maturation. Accordingly, compound heterozygous embryos for Runx2 and Fgf18
deletion display the same chondrocyte maturation phenotype as Fgf18-null embryos.
This study identifies a transcriptional basis for the inhibition of chondrocyte
maturation by perichondrium and reveals that Runx2 fulfills antagonistic
functions during chondrogenesis.

Down-regulation of ubiquitin ligase Cbl induced by twist haploinsufficiency in
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome results in increased PI3K/Akt signaling and osteoblast
proliferation.

Hospital, 2 rue Ambroise Paré, 75475 Paris Cedex 10, France.

Genetic mutations of Twist, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, induce
premature fusion of cranial sutures in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS). We report 
here a previously undescribed mechanism involved in the altered
osteoblastogenesis in SCS. Cranial osteoblasts from an SCS patient with a Twist
mutation causing basic helix-loop-helix deletion exhibited decreased expression
of E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl compared with wild-type osteoblasts. This was
associated with decreased ubiquitin-mediated degradation of phosphatidyl inositol
3 kinase (PI3K) and increased PI3K expression and PI3K/Akt signaling. Increased
PI3K immunoreactivity was also found in osteoblasts in histological sections of
affected cranial sutures from SCS patients. Transfection with Twist or Cbl
abolished the increased PI3K/Akt signaling in Twist mutant osteoblasts. Forced
overexpression of Cbl did not correct the altered expression of osteoblast
differentiation markers in Twist mutant cells. In contrast, pharmacological
inhibition of PI3K/Akt, but not ERK signaling, corrected the increased cell
growth in Twist mutant osteoblasts. The results show that Twist
haploinsufficiency results in decreased Cbl-mediated PI3K degradation in
osteoblasts, causing PI3K accumulation and activation of PI3K/Akt-dependent
osteoblast growth. This provides genetic and biochemical evidence for a role for 
Cbl-mediated PI3K signaling in the altered osteoblast phenotype induced by Twist 
haploinsufficiency in SCS.

University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China.

PURPOSE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a rapidly growing tumor associated
with a high propensity for vascular invasion and metastasis.
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key event in the tumor invasion
process. Recently, Twist has been identified to play an important role in
EMT-mediated metastasis through the regulation of E-cadherin expression. However,
the actual role of Twist in tumor invasiveness remains unclear. The purpose of
this study is to investigate the expression and possible role of Twist in HCC.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated Twist and E-cadherin expression in HCC tissue
microarray of paired primary and metastatic HCC by immunohistochemical staining. 
The role of Twist in EMT-mediated invasiveness was also evaluated in vitro in HCC
cell lines.
RESULTS: We first showed that overexpression of Twist was correlated with HCC
metastasis (P=0.001) and its expression was negatively correlated with E-cadherin
expression (P=0.001, r=-0.443) by tissue microarray. A significant increase of
Twist at the mRNA level was also found in metastatic HCC cell lines MHCC-97H,
MHCC-97L, and H2M when compared with nonmetastatic Huh-7, H2P, and PLC cell
lines. The MHCC-97H cell line, which has a higher metastatic ability, was found
to have a higher level of Twist than MHCC-97L. Accompanied with increased Twist
expression in the metastatic HCC cell lines when compared with the nonmetastatic 
primary ones, we found decreased E-cadherin mRNA expression in the metastatic HCC
cell lines. By ectopic transfection of Twist into PLC cells, Twist was able to
suppress E-cadherin expression and induce EMT changes, which was correlated with 
increased HCC cell invasiveness.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that Twist overexpression was correlated with HCC
metastasis through induction of EMT changes and HCC cell invasiveness.

Dynamic changes in chromatin acetylation and the expression of histone
acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases regulate the SM22alpha transcription 
in response to Smad3-mediated TGFbeta1 signaling.

TGFbeta1 plays critical roles in stimulating smooth muscle gene transcription
during myofibroblast and smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation. Increasing
evidence demonstrates that histone modification plays important roles in
regulating gene transcription. Here, we investigated the effect of changes in the
expression of histone acetyltransferases (HAT) or histone deacetylases (HDAC) on 
TGFbeta1-induced SM22 promoter activities. We found that overexpressing HAT
proteins such as p300 and CBP enhances TGFbeta1-induced SM22 promoter activities;
conversely, overexpressing HAT inhibitor such as Twist1 (but not Twist2/Dermo-1) 
and E1A suppresses this effect of TGFbeta1. We also found that TSA, a HDAC
inhibitor that stimulates histone acetylation of the SM22alpha locus, further
enhances the transactivational activity of Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4, and relieves
the inhibitory effect of Smad6, Smad7, and the dominant negative mutants of
Smads. TGFbeta1 also stimulates the association of Smad3 (a potent transactivator
for the SM22 promoter) and p300 by co-immunoprecipitation assay. In contrast,
overexpressing HDAC 1-6 inhibits TGFbeta1-induced as well as Smad3 and
myocardin-activated SM22 promoter. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
assays show that TGFbeta1 induces histone acetylation at the SM22alpha locus.
This study demonstrates that the balance of HAT and HDAC expression affects
TGFbeta1-induced SM22alpha transcription; TGFbeta1-induced SM22alpha
transcription is accompanied by histone hyperacetylation at the SM22alpha locus. 
This study provides the first evidence showing that histone hyperacetylation of
the SM22 promoter is a target of TGFbeta1 signaling, suggesting that modulation
of histone acetylation is involved in the molecular mechanisms of
TGFbeta1-regulated SMC gene transcription.

A dozen years have passed since the first genetic lesion was identified in a
family with craniosynostosis, the premature fusion of the cranial sutures.
Subsequently, mutations in the FGFR2, FGFR3, TWIST1, and EFNB1 genes have been
shown to account for approximately 25% of craniosynostosis, whilst several
additional genes make minor contributions. Using specific examples, we show how
these discoveries have enabled refinement of information on diagnosis, recurrence
risk, prognosis for mental development, and surgical planning. However,
phenotypic variability can present a significant challenge to the clinical
interpretation of molecular genetic tests. In particular, the difficulty of
analyzing the complex interaction of genetic background and prenatal environment 
in determining clinical features, limits the value of identifying low penetrance 
mutations.

Upregulation of Twist in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma is associated with
neoplastic transformation and distant metastasis.

Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China.

BACKGROUND: The antiapoptotic and epithelial-mesenchymal transition activities of
Twist have been implicated in the neoplastic transformation and the development
of metastasis, respectively. Upregulation of Twist, described in several types of
human cancer, also acts as a prognostic marker of poor outcome.
AIM: To investigate Twist expression in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
and its prognostic value in a Chinese cohort of patients with oesophageal SCC.
METHODS: Twist expression in primary oesophageal SCC of 87 Chinese patients was
investigated by immunohistochemical staining. Twist protein level in one
immortalised normal oesophageal epithelial cell line and six oesophageal SCC cell
lines was measured by western blot analysis. Twist mRNA level in 30 pairs of
frozen specimens of primary oesophageal SCC and non-neoplastic oesophageal
epithelium from the upper resection margin of corresponding oesophagectomy
specimen was also determined by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR.
RESULTS: It was found that Twist was upregulated in oesophageal SCC cell lines,
and its mRNA and protein levels were both increased in oesophageal SCC and the
non-neoplastic oesophageal epithelium (p<0.001). In addition, a high level of
Twist expression in oesophageal SCC was significantly associated with a greater
risk for the patient of developing distant metastasis within 1 year of
oesophagectomy (OR 3.462, 95% CI 1.201 to 9.978; p=0.022).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that upregulation of Twist plays a role in the
neoplastic transformation to oesophageal SCC and subsequent development of
distant metastasis. Twist may serve as a useful prognostic marker for predicting 
the development of distant metastasis in oesophageal SCC.

Adult liver tissue regeneration may recapitulate molecular events of liver
organogenesis. As gaps in our understanding of the fundamental processes that
govern development and regeneration of the liver still exist, we studied gene
expression in the developing liver at embryonic day 9.5 post coitum (E d9.5
p.c.). Microarray data from E d9.5 p.c. as well as previously published data from
embryonic day 11.5 post coitum (E d11.5 p.c.) and embryonic day 13.5 post coitum 
(E d13.5 p.c.) were subjected to cluster analysis. This led to the identification
of 130 genes which were characterized by continuous expression at all stages of
liver development with peak expression of 44 genes at E d9.5 p.c. Five of these
genes, previously not known to be associated with early liver development or with
adult liver regeneration were selected for further analysis. The expression of
the genes was studied by real-time polymerase chain reaction at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12,
24 and 48 hr after partial hepatectomy in the adult liver. Two of the genes,
growth arrest protein 43 (GAP43) and paired-like homeodomain transcription factor
2 (Pitx2) were exclusively detected at 24 hr, whereas the genes Twist1, Midkine, 
and zinc finger protein of cerebellum 1 (Zic1) each showed a specific expression 
profile in the regenerating liver with peak expressions at 4, 24, and 6 hr,
respectively. In summary, we were able to identify novel genes, that may act as
regulators during liver formation as well as in the regeneration phase of adult
liver. This information may contribute to the development of new targets for the 
treatment of liver diseases in the future.

N-cadherin gene expression in prostate carcinoma is modulated by
integrin-dependent nuclear translocation of Twist1.

(1)Cancer Biology Graduate Interdisciplinary Program, and Department of Surgery, 
University of Arizona Health Sciences Center, 1501 North Campbell Avenue, Tucson,
AZ 85724, USA.

The gain of N-cadherin expression in carcinomas has been shown to be important in
the regulation of cell migration, invasion, and survival. Here, we show that
N-cadherin mRNA expression in PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells is dependent on
beta(1) integrin-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin and the basic
helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist1. Depletion of Twist1 mRNA by small
interfering RNA resulted in decreased expression of both Twist1 and N-cadherin
and the inhibition of cell migration. Whereas Twist1 gene expression was
independent of beta(1) integrin-mediated adhesion, Twist1 protein failed to
accumulate in the nuclei of cells cultured in anchorage-independent conditions.
The increased nuclear accumulation of Twist1 following cell attachment was
suppressed by treatment with an inhibitor of Rho kinase or a beta(1) integrin
neutralizing antibody. The effect of Twist1 on induction of N-cadherin mRNA
required an E-box cis-element located within the first intron (+2,627) of the
N-cadherin gene. These data raise the possibility that integrin-mediated adhesion
to interstitial matrix proteins during metastasis differentially regulates the
nuclear/cytoplasmic translocation and DNA binding of Twist1, activating
N-cadherin transcription.

A major obstacle to the expansion of abnormal cells with significant
proliferative potential is the induction of either cellular senescence or
programmed cell death. Consequently, oncogene-driven hyperproliferation must be
associated with apoptosis inhibition to allow malignant outgrowth. The oncogenic 
cooperation of N-Myc and Twist 1 in the development of neuroblastoma, the most
common and deadly solid tumour of childhood, perfectly illustrates such a
process. N-Myc promotes cell proliferation whereas Twist 1 counteracts its
pro-apoptotic properties by knocking-down the ARF/p53 pathway. This observation
provides a mechanistic explanation for the rarity of p53 mutations in
neuroblastomas. It also highlights the involvement of two crucial regulators of
embryogenesis in human cancer development. In this review, we discuss the
possible role of Twist 1 in tumour progression, based on the numerous recent
studies reporting its overexpression in a variety of human cancers.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is critical not only for morphogenesis
during embryonic development but also the conversion of early-stage tumors into
infiltrative phenotypes. The present study examines the expression of Twist, a
highly conserved bHLH transcription factor that is known to promote EMT, and
evaluated its prognostic significance in endometrial cancers. Tissue specimens
from 70 patients with endometrial cancer who underwent primary surgery were
immunohistochemically evaluated for Twist expression. A semiquantitative scoring 
system was developed based on the intensity and extent of cancer cells with Twist
expression. Thirty-six patients (51%) exhibited high Twist expression and 34
(49%) had low expression. Most cases exhibited both cytoplasmic and nuclear
staining mainly observed in cancer foci and, preferentially, at the margin but,
in some cases, the stromal cells located adjacent to cancer foci as well. Among
various clinical variables, high Twist expression was significantly associated
with deep myometrial invasion (>1/2) (P = .012) and concurrent with decreased
E-cadherin expression (P < .001), a hallmark of EMT. In univariate survival
analyses, both myometrial invasion and Twist expression influenced overall
survival, but Cox multivariate analyses revealed that only Twist was an
independent predictor of patient survival (hazard ratio, 5.12; P = .023). Thus,
our data implies that high Twist expression is a potential novel prognostic
factor for disease survival of endometrial cancer. Furthermore, the present study
implicates Twist as a potential therapeutic target for this tumor type.

Boundaries between cellular compartments often serve as signaling interfaces
during embryogenesis. The coronal suture is a major growth center of the skull
vault and develops at a boundary between cells derived from neural crest and
mesodermal origin, forming the frontal and parietal bones, respectively.
Premature fusion of these bones, termed coronal synostosis, is a common human
developmental anomaly. Known causes of coronal synostosis include
haploinsufficiency of TWIST1 and a gain of function mutation in MSX2. In
Twist1(+/-) mice with coronal synostosis, we found that the frontal-parietal
boundary is defective. Specifically, neural crest cells invade the
undifferentiated mesoderm of the Twist1(+/-) mutant coronal suture. This boundary
defect is accompanied by an expansion in Msx2 expression and reduction in
ephrin-A4 distribution. Reduced dosage of Msx2 in the Twist1 mutant background
restores the expression of ephrin-A4, rescues the suture boundary and inhibits
craniosynostosis. Underlining the importance of ephrin-A4, we identified
heterozygous mutations in the human orthologue, EFNA4, in three of 81 patients
with non-syndromic coronal synostosis. This provides genetic evidence that
Twist1, Msx2 and Efna4 function together in boundary formation and the
pathogenesis of coronal synostosis.

Q289P mutation in FGFR2 gene causes Saethre-Chotzen syndrome: some considerations
about familial heterogeneity.

Campinas, 13083-970 Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the first report on a three-generation family presenting
typical features of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, in which the Q289P mutation in the 
FGFR2 gene was detected.
DESIGN: Dysmorphological evaluation was performed by a clinical geneticist.
Direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified coding region of
TWIST and screening for the P250R mutation in the FGFR3 gene were performed.
Exons IIIa and IIIc of FGFR2 were sequenced also. The mutation was confirmed by
both restriction-enzyme digestion and allelic-specific polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Neither TWIST gene analysis nor analysis of the P250R mutation on gene
FGFR3 showed mutation within the coding sequence. A nucleotide change from CAG to
CCG in exon IIIa of the FGFR2 gene that caused a Q289P mutation was detected,
although exon IIIc in the propositus was normal. These same results were detected
in his mother, but no other members of the kindred presented clinical features
consistent with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS: This mutation was previously reported in individuals with Crouzon
and Jackson-Weiss syndromes. The FGFR2 mutation in the family with
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome herein reported reinforces the idea of an interaction
among TWIST and FGFR genes during development. Absence of the Q289P mutation in
some affected individuals in this family is discussed.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are highly invasive soft tissue 
sarcomas that arise within the peripheral nerve and frequently metastasize. To
identify molecular events contributing to malignant transformation in peripheral 
nerve, we compared eight cell lines derived from MPNSTs and seven normal human
Schwann cell samples. We found that MPNST lines are heterogeneous in their in
vitro growth rates and exhibit diverse alterations in expression of pRb, p53,
p14(Arf), and p16(INK4a) proteins. All MPNST cell lines express the epidermal
growth factor receptor and lack S100beta protein. Global gene expression
profiling using Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays identified a 159-gene
molecular signature distinguishing MPNST cell lines from normal Schwann cells,
which was validated in Affymetrix microarray data generated from 45 primary
MPNSTs. Expression of Schwann cell differentiation markers (SOX10, CNP, PMP22,
and NGFR) was down-regulated in MPNSTs whereas neural crest stem cell markers,
SOX9 and TWIST1, were overexpressed in MPNSTs. Previous studies have implicated
TWIST1 in apoptosis inhibition, resistance to chemotherapy, and metastasis.
Reducing TWIST1 expression in MPNST cells using small interfering RNA did not
affect apoptosis or chemoresistance but inhibited cell chemotaxis. Our results
highlight the use of gene expression profiling in identifying genes and molecular
pathways that are potential biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets for treatment
of MPNST and support the use of the MPNST cell lines as a primary analytic tool.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is associated with haploinsufficiency of the
basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor TWIST1 and is characterized by
premature closure of the cranial sutures, termed craniosynostosis; however, the
mechanisms underlying this defect are unclear. Twist1 has been shown to play both
positive and negative roles in mesenchymal specification and differentiation, and
here we show that the activity of Twist1 is dependent on its dimer partner.
Twist1 forms both homodimers (T/T) and heterodimers with E2A E proteins (T/E) and
the relative level of Twist1 to the HLH inhibitor Id proteins determines which
dimer forms. On the basis of the expression patterns of Twist1 and Id1 within the
cranial sutures, we hypothesized that Twist1 forms homodimers in the osteogenic
fronts and T/E heterodimers in the mid-sutures. In support of this hypothesis, we
have found that genes regulated by T/T homodimers, such as FGFR2 and periostin,
are expressed in the osteogenic fronts, whereas genes regulated by T/E
heterodimers, such as thrombospondin-1, are expressed in the mid-sutures. The
ratio between these dimers is altered in the sutures of Twist1+/- mice, favoring 
an increase in homodimers and an expansion of the osteogenic fronts. Of interest,
the T/T to T/E ratio is greater in the coronal versus the sagittal suture, and
this finding may contribute to making the coronal suture more susceptible to
fusion due to TWIST haploinsufficiency. Importantly, we were able to inhibit
suture fusion in Twist1+/- mice by modulating the balance between these dimers
toward T/E formation, by either increasing the expression of E2A E12 or by
decreasing Id expression. Therefore, we have identified dimer partner selection
as an important mediator of Twist1 function and provide a mechanistic
understanding of craniosynostosis due to TWIST haploinsufficiency.

A gene expression signature that distinguishes desmoid tumours from nodular
fasciitis.

Nodular fasciitis (NF) is a rapidly growing cellular mass composed of
fibroblasts/myofibroblasts, usually localized in subcutaneous tissues, that
typically undergoes fibrosis and almost never recurs. Desmoid tumours (DTs) are
rare forms of fibroblastic/myofibroblastic growth that arise in deep soft
tissues, display a propensity for local infiltration and recurrence, but fail to 
metastasize. Given that both entities are primarily fibroblastic/myofibroblastic 
lesions with overlapping histological features, their gene expression profiles
were compared to identify differentially expressed genes that may provide not
only potential diagnostic markers, but also clues as to the pathogenesis of each 
disorder. Differentially expressed transcripts (89 clones displaying increased
expression in DTs and 246 clones displaying increased expression in NF) included 
genes encoding several receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (EPHB3, PTPRF, 
GNAZ, SYK, LYN, EPHA4, BIRC3), transcription factors (TWIST1, PITX2, EYA2, OAS1, 
MITF, TCF20), and members of the Wnt signalling pathway (AXIN2, WISP1, SFRP).
Remarkably, almost one-quarter of the differentially expressed genes encode
proteins associated with inflammation and tissue remodelling, including members
of the interferon (IFN), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), and transforming growth
factor beta (TGF-beta) signalling pathways as well as metalloproteinases (MMP1,
9, 13, 23), urokinase plasminogen activator (PLAU), and cathepsins. The
observations provide the first comparative molecular characterization of desmoid 
tumours and nodular fasciitis and suggest that selected tyrosine kinases,
transcription factors, and members of the Wnt, TGF-beta, IFN, and TNF signalling 
pathways may be implicated in influencing and distinguishing their fate.

The present study was aimed to determine twist expression in nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (NPC) and to investigate the clinicopathological significance in the
progress of NPC. Semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting were carried out to
investigate the expression of Twist in NPC cell lines and normal nasopharyngeal
epithelial cell line, which showed that both Twist mRNA and protein were
up-regulated in the tumor cells in comparison with the normal cells. We then
examined Twist mRNA expression in non-cancerous nasopharyngeal mucosa (10 cases) 
and NPC (95 cases) using in situ hybridization. The results showed that Twist was
overexpressed in 59 of 95 (62.1%) NPC samples. In contrast, there was no obvious 
expression of Twist mRNA in non-cancerous tissues. In addition, another 75 NPC
samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and 33 of the 75 samples were
shown to be positive for Twist protein. Both Twist mRNA expression and Twist
protein expression were positively associated with lymph-node metastasis and
distant metastasis. Furthermore, expression of Twist protein was correlated with 
the NPC prognosis. Patients with NPC who were Twist protein-positive had a worse 
5-year survival rate. These findings demonstrate that the Twist may play an
important role in the invasion and metastasis of NPC. Twist protein is valuable
marker for assessing the prognosis of NPC.

TGFbeta-mediated FGF signaling is crucial for regulating cranial neural crest
cell proliferation during frontal bone development.

Southern California, 2250 Alcazar Street, CSA 103, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.

The murine frontal bone derives entirely from the cranial neural crest (CNC) and 
consists of the calvarial (lateral) aspect that covers the frontal lobe of brain 
and the orbital aspect that forms the roof of bony orbit. TGFbeta and FGF
signaling have important regulatory roles in postnatal calvarial development. Our
previous study has demonstrated that conditional inactivation of Tgfbr2 in the
neural crest results in severe defects in calvarial development, although the
cellular and molecular mechanisms by which TGFbeta signaling regulates the fate
of CNC cells during frontal bone development remain unknown. Here, we show that
TGFbeta IIR is required for proliferation of osteoprogenitor cells in the
CNC-derived frontal bone anlagen. FGF acts downstream of TGFbeta signaling in
regulating CNC cell proliferation, and exogenous FGF2 rescues the cell
proliferation defect in the frontal primordium of Tgfbr2 mutant. Furthermore, the
CNC-derived frontal primordium requires TGFbeta IIR to undergo terminal
differentiation. However, this requirement is restricted to the developing
calvarial aspect of the frontal bone, whereas the orbital aspect forms despite
the ablation of Tgfbr2 gene, implying a differential requirement for TGFbeta
signaling during the development of various regions of the frontal bone. This
study demonstrates the biological significance of TGFbeta-mediated FGF signaling 
cascade in regulating frontal bone development, suggests that TGFbeta functions
as a morphogen in regulating the fate of the CNC-derived osteoblast and provides 
a model for investigating abnormal craniofacial development.

Aggressive cancer phenotypes are a manifestation of many different genetic
alterations that promote rapid proliferation and metastasis. In this study, we
show that stable overexpression of Twist in a breast cancer cell line, MCF-7,
altered its morphology to a fibroblastic-like phenotype, which exhibited protein 
markers representative of a mesenchymal transformation. In addition, it was
observed that MCF-7/Twist cells had increased vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) synthesis when compared with empty vector control cells. The functional
changes induced by VEGF in vivo were analyzed by functional magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) of MCF-7/Twist-xenografted tumors. MRI showed that MCF-7/Twist
tumors exhibited higher vascular volume and vascular permeability in vivo than
the MCF-7/vector control xenografts. Moreover, elevated expression of Twist in
breast tumor samples obtained from patients correlated strongly with high-grade
invasive carcinomas and with chromosome instability, particularly gains of
chromosomes 1 and 7. Taken together, these results show that Twist overexpression
in breast cancer cells can induce angiogenesis, correlates with chromosomal
instability, and promotes an epithelial-mesenchymal-like transition that is
pivotal for the transformation into an aggressive breast cancer phenotype.

Bmp2 is essential for cardiac cushion epithelial-mesenchymal transition and
myocardial patterning.

Science Center, 2121 West Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

Cardiac cushion development provides a valuable system to investigate epithelial 
to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a fundamental process in development and tumor
progression. In the atrioventricular (AV) canal, endocardial cells lining the
heart respond to a myocardial-derived signal, undergo EMT, and contribute to
cushion mesenchyme. Here, we inactivated bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2) in
the AV myocardium of mice. We show that Bmp2 has three functions in the AV canal:
to enhance formation of the cardiac jelly, to induce endocardial EMT and to
pattern the AV myocardium. Bmp2 is required for myocardial expression of Has2, a 
crucial component of the cardiac jelly matrix. During EMT, Bmp2 promotes
expression of the basic helix-loop-helix factor Twist1, previously implicated in 
EMT in cancer metastases, and the homeobox genes Msx1 and Msx2. Deletion of the
Bmp type 1A receptor, Bmpr1a, in endocardium also resulted in failed cushion
formation, indicating that Bmp2 signals directly to cushion-forming endocardium
to induce EMT. Lastly, we show that Bmp2 mutants failed to specify the AV
myocardium with loss of Tbx2 expression uncovering a myocardial, planar signaling
function for Bmp2. Our data indicate that Bmp2 has a crucial role in coordinating
multiple aspects of AV canal morphogenesis.

Growth of the normal skull vault and its alteration in craniosynostosis: insights
from human genetics and experimental studies.

The mammalian skull vault is constructed principally from five bones: the paired 
frontals and parietals, and the unpaired interparietal. These bones abut at
sutures, where most growth of the skull vault takes place. Sutural growth
involves maintenance of a population of proliferating osteoprogenitor cells which
differentiate into bone matrix-secreting osteoblasts. Sustained function of the
sutures as growth centres is essential for continuous expansion of the skull
vault to accommodate the growing brain. Craniosynostosis, the premature fusion of
the cranial sutures, occurs in 1 in 2500 children and often presents challenging 
clinical problems. Until a dozen years ago, little was known about the causes of 
craniosynostosis but the discovery of mutations in the MSX2, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3,
TWIST1 and EFNB1 genes in both syndromic and non-syndromic cases has led to
considerable insights into the aetiology, classification and developmental
pathology of these disorders. Investigations of the biological roles of these
genes in cranial development and growth have been carried out in normal and
mutant mice, elucidating their individual and interdependent roles in normal
sutures and in sutures undergoing synostosis. Mouse studies have also revealed a 
significant correspondence between the neural crest-mesoderm boundary in the
early embryonic head and the position of cranial sutures, suggesting roles for
tissue interaction in suture formation, including initiation of the signalling
system that characterizes the functionally active suture.

A major obstacle to the expansion of abnormal cells with significant
proliferative potential is the induction of programmed cell death. Consequently, 
oncogene-driven hyperproliferation must be associated with apoptosis inhibition
to allow malignant outgrowth. The oncogenic cooperation of N-Myc and Twist-1 in
the development of neuroblastoma, the most common and deadly solid tumour of
childhood, perfectly illustrates such a process. N-Myc promotes cell
proliferation, whereas Twist-1 counteracts its pro-apoptotic properties by
knocking-down the ARF/p53 pathway. On the basis of numerous recent studies
reporting its overexpression in a variety of human cancers, we discuss in this
review the role of Twist-1 as a potent inhibitor of the cell safety programs
engaged in response to an abnormal mitogenic activity.

The Wnt-inducible transcription factor Twist1 inhibits chondrogenesis.

(1)Department of Pathology, University of Texas Health Science Center, San
Antonio, Texas 78229, USA.

Wnt signaling is essential for many developmental processes, including
skeletogenesis. To investigate the effects of Wnt signaling during skeletogenesis
we studied the effects of Wnt on cultured chondrocytic cells and differentiating 
limb-bud mesenchyme. We showed that Wnt3a strongly repressed chondrogenesis and
chondrocyte gene expression. Canonical Wnt signaling was responsible for the
repression of differentiation, as evidenced by results showing that inhibition of
glycogen synthase kinase 3 or expression of beta-catenin caused similar
repression of differentiation. Significantly, we showed that the transcription
repressor Twist1 is induced by canonical Wnt signaling. Expression of Twist1
strongly inhibited chondrocyte gene expression and short hairpin RNA knockdown of
Twist1 transcript levels caused increased expression of the chondrocyte-specific 
genes aggrecan and type II collagen. Interestingly, Twist1 interfered with
BMP2-induced expression of aggrecan and type II collagen expression and knockdown
of Twist1 augmented BMP2-induced aggrecan and type II collagen expression. These 
data support the conclusions that Twist1 contributes to the repression of
chondrogenesis and chondrocyte gene expression resulting from canonical Wnt
signaling and that Twist1 interferes with BMP-dependent signaling.

The Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS) is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis
syndrome with uni- or bilateral coronal synostosis and mild limb deformities. It 
is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the TWIST 1 gene. In an attempt to
delineate functional features separating SCS from Muenke's syndrome, we screened 
patients presenting with coronal suture synostosis for mutations in the TWIST 1
gene, and for the Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3. Within a total of 124 independent 
pedigrees, 39 (71 patients) were identified to carry 25 different mutations of
TWIST 1 including 14 novel mutations, to which six whole gene deletions were
added. The 71 patients were compared with 42 subjects from 24 pedigrees carrying 
the Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3 and 65 subjects from 61 pedigrees without a
detectable mutation. Classical SCS associated with a TWIST 1 mutation could be
separated phenotypically from the Muenke phenotype on the basis of the following 
features: low-set frontal hairline, gross ptosis of eyelids, subnormal ear
length, dilated parietal foramina, interdigital webbing, and hallux valgus or
broad great toe with bifid distal phalanx. Functional differences were even more 
important: intracranial hypertension as a consequence of early progressive
multisutural fusion was a significant problem in SCS only, while mental delay and
sensorineural hearing loss were associated with the Muenke's syndrome. Contrary
to previous reports, SCS patients with complete loss of one TWIST allele showed
normal mental development.

A twisted hand: bHLH protein phosphorylation and dimerization regulate limb
development.

Disorders, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA. jcai@jhmi.edu

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS), a human autosomal dominant condition with limb
defects and craniosynostosis, is caused by haploinsufficiency of TWIST1, a basic 
helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor. Until recently, the molecular
pathogenesis of the limb defects in SCS has not been well understood. Now,
Firulli et al.1 show in mouse and chick that ectopic expression of a related bHLH
protein, Hand2, results in phenocopies of the limb defects caused by Twist1
loss-of-function mutations. These two proteins interact in a dosage-dependent
antagonistic manner, and both can be regulated through phosphorylation at
conserved helix I amino acid residues. These findings provide an important link
between the misregulation of Twist1 dimerization and the limb phenotypes observed
in SCS.

TWIST, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that regulates
mesodermal development, has been shown to promote tumor cell metastasis and to
enhance survival in response to cytotoxic stress. Our analysis of rat C6 glioma
cell-derived cDNA revealed TWIST expression, suggesting that the gene may play a 
role in the genesis and physiology of primary brain tumors. To further delineate 
a possible oncogenic role for TWIST in the central nervous system (CNS), we
analyzed TWIST expression in human gliomas and normal brain by using reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction, Northern blot analysis, in situ
hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. TWIST expression was detected in the
large majority of human glioma-derived cell lines and human gliomas examined.
Levels of TWIST mRNA were associated with the highest grade gliomas, and
increased TWIST expression accompanied transition from low grade to high grade in
vivo, suggesting a role for TWIST in promoting malignant progression. In accord, 
elevated TWIST mRNA abundance preceded the spontaneous malignant transformation
of cultured mouse astrocytes hemizygous for p53. Overexpression of TWIST protein 
in a human glioma cell line significantly enhanced tumor cell invasion, a
hallmark of high-grade gliomas. These findings support roles for TWIST both in
early glial tumorigenesis and subsequent malignant progression. TWIST was also
expressed in embryonic and fetal human brain, and in neurons, but not glia, of
mature brain, indicating that, in gliomas, TWIST may promote the functions also
critical for CNS development or normal neuronal physiology.

Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor in children. After initial
diagnosis is made with a biopsy, treatment consists of preoperative chemotherapy 
followed by definitive surgery and postoperative chemotherapy. The degree of
tumor necrosis in response to preoperative chemotherapy is a reliable prognostic 
factor and is used to guide the choice of postoperative chemotherapy. Patients
with tumors, which reveal > or = 90% necrosis (good responders), have a much
better prognosis than those with < 90% necrosis (poor responders). Despite
previous attempts to improve the outcome of poor responders by modifying the
postoperative chemotherapy, their prognosis remains poor. Therefore, there is a
need to predict at the time of diagnosis patients' response to preoperative
chemotherapy. This will provide the basis for developing potentially effective
therapy that can be given at the outset for those who are likely to have a poor
response. Here, we report the analysis of 34 pediatric osteosarcoma samples by
expression profiling. Using parametric two-sample t test, we identified 45 genes 
that discriminate between good and poor responders (P < 0.005) in 20 definitive
surgery samples. A support vector machine classifier was built using these
predictor genes and was tested for its ability to classify initial biopsy
samples. Five of six initial biopsy samples that had corresponding definitive
surgery samples in the training set were classified correctly (83%; confidence
interval, 36%, 100%). When this classifier was used to predict eight independent 
initial biopsy samples, there was 100% accuracy (confidence interval, 63%, 100%).
Many of the predictor genes are implicated in bone development, drug resistance, 
and tumorigenesis.

Remarkable phenotype plasticity of epithelial cells underlies morphogenesis,
epithelial repair and tumor invasiveness. Detailed understanding of the
contextual cues and molecular mediators that control epithelial plasticity will
be required in order to develop viable therapeutic approaches targeting
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), an advanced manifestation of
epithelial plasticity. Members of the transforming growth factor (TGF-beta)
family of growth factors can initiate and maintain EMT in a variety of biological
systems and pathophysiological context by activating major signaling pathways and
transcriptional regulators integrated in extensive signaling networks. Here we
will review the distinct physiological contexts of EMT and the underlying
molecular signaling networks controlled by TGF-beta.

Trefoil factor 3 (intestinal trefoil factor) is a cytoprotective factor in the
gut. Herein we compared the effect of trefoil factor 3 with tumor necrosis
factor-alpha on 1) activation of NF-kappaB in intestinal epithelial cells; 2)
expression of Twist protein (a molecule essential for downregulation of nuclear
factor-kappaB activity in vivo); and 3) production of interleukin-8. We showed
that Twist protein is constitutively expressed in intestinal epithelial cells.
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced persistent degradation of Twist protein in
intestinal epithelial cells via a signaling pathway linked to proteasome, which
was associated with prolonged activation of NF-kappaB. In contrast to tumor
necrosis factor, trefoil factor 3 triggered transient activation of NF-kappaB and
prolonged upregulation of Twist protein in intestinal epithelial cells via an ERK
kinase-mediated pathway. Unlike tumor necrosis factor-alpha, transient activation
of NF-kappaB by trefoil factor 3 is not associated with induction of IL-8 in
cells. To examine the role of Twist protein in intestinal epithelial cells, we
silenced the Twist expression by siRNA. Our data showed that trefoil factor 3
induced interleukin-8 production after silencing Twist in intestinal epithelial
cells. Together, these observations indicated that 1) trefoil factor 3 triggers a
diverse signal from tumor necrosis factor-alpha on the activation of NF-kappaB
and its associated molecules in intestinal epithelial cells; and 2) trefoil
factor 3-induced Twist protein plays an important role in the modulation of
inflammatory cytokine production in intestinal epithelial cells.

Androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer is the main obstacle in the
treatment of this cancer. Unlike a majority of solid cancers, prostate cancer
usually shows poor response to chemotherapeutic drugs. In this study, we have
shown a potential novel target, TWIST, a highly conserved bHLH transcription
factor, in the treatment of prostate cancer. Using malignant and nonmalignant
prostate tissues, we found that TWIST expression was highly expressed in the
majority (90%) of prostate cancer tissues but only in a small percentage (6.7%)
of benign prostate hyperplasia. In addition, the TWIST expression levels were
positively correlated with Gleason grading and metastasis, indicating its role in
the development and progression of prostate cancer. Furthermore, down-regulation 
of TWIST through small interfering RNA in androgen-independent prostate cancer
cell lines, DU145 and PC3, resulted in increased sensitivity to the anticancer
drug taxol-induced cell death which was associated with decreased Bcl/Bax ratio, 
leading to activation of the apoptosis pathway. More importantly, inactivation of
TWIST suppressed migration and invasion abilities of androgen-independent
prostate cancer cells, which was correlated with induction of E-cadherin
expression as well as morphologic and molecular changes associated with
mesenchymal to epithelial transition. These results were further confirmed on the
androgen-dependent LNCaP cells ectopically expressing the TWIST protein. Our
results have identified TWIST as a critical regulator of prostate cancer cell
growth and suggest a potential therapeutic approach to inhibit the growth and
metastasis of androgen-independent prostate cancer through inactivation of the
TWIST gene.

Gain-of-function mutations in LRP5 have been shown to cause high BMD disorders
showing variable expression of some clinical symptoms, including torus palatinus 
and neurological complications. In an extended family, we were able to add
craniosynostosis and developmental delay to the clinical spectrum associated with
LRP5 mutations. We report on an extended four-generation family with 13 affected 
individuals (7 men and 6 women) in which an autosomal dominant type of
osteosclerosis segregates. Osteosclerosis was most pronounced in the cranial base
and calvarium, starting in early childhood with variable expression and a
progressive character. Craniosynostosis at an early age was reported in four
affected family members (two males and two females). The patients also presented 
with dysmorphic features (macrocephaly, brachycephaly, wide and high forehead,
hypertelorism, prominent cheekbones, prominent jaw). They have normal height and 
proportions. Neurological complications like entrapment of cranial nerves
resulting in optical nerve atrophy, hearing loss, and facial palsy were reported 
in two individuals. A mild developmental delay was reported in three affected
individuals. None of the patients have torus palatinus, increased rate of
fractures, osteomyelitis, hepatosplenomegaly, or pancytopenia. A missense
mutation 640G-->A (A214T) in the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein
5 (LRP5) gene was found in all affected individuals analyzed, including cases in 
whom craniosynostosis, a mild developmental delay, and/or macrocephaly is
observed. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature of
patients presenting with autosomal dominant osteosclerosis in whom a variable
expression of craniosynostosis, macrocephaly, and mild developmental delay is
observed, which is most likely associated with a mutation in the LRP5 gene. These
phenotypes can therefore be added to the clinical spectrum of LRP5-associated
bone disorders.

We describe the clinical characterization, molecular analyses, and genetic
mapping of a distinct genetic condition characterized by craniosynostosis,
delayed closure of the fontanel, cranial defects, clavicular hypoplasia, anal and
genitourinary malformations, and skin eruption. We have identified seven patients
with this phenotype in four families from different geographic regions and ethnic
backgrounds. This is an autosomal recessive condition that brings together
apparently opposing pathophysiologic and developmental processes, including
accelerated suture closure and delayed ossification. Selected candidate
genes--including RUNX2, CBFB, MSX2, ALX4, TWIST1, and RECQL4--were screened for
mutations, by direct sequencing of their coding regions, and for microdeletions, 
by fluorescent in situ hybridization. No mutations or microdeletions were
detected in any of the genes analyzed. A genomewide screen yielded the maximum
estimated LOD score of +2.38 for markers D22S283 and D22S274 on chromosome
22q12-q13. We hypothesize that the gene defect in this condition causes novel
context-dependent dysregulation of multiple signaling pathways, including RUNX2, 
during osteoblast differentiation and craniofacial morphogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a craniosynostosis syndrome further
characterized by distinctive facial and limb abnormalities. It shows complete
penetrance and variable expressivity and has been linked to the TWIST gene on
chromosome 7p21; more than 80 different intragenic mutations and, recently, large
deletions have been detected in Saethre-Chotzen patients. The aim of this study
was to genetically and phenotypically characterize patients with a clinical
diagnosis of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.
METHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis as well as those with a genetic
diagnosis of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (n = 34) were included in the study.
RESULTS: The study showed that the important features of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome
are brachycephaly (occurring in 74 percent of patients), a broad, depressed nasal
bridge (65 percent), a high forehead (56 percent), ptosis (53 percent), and
prominent auricular crura (56 percent). Furthermore, using different molecular
techniques, pathogenic mutations in the TWIST gene were identified in 71 percent 
of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with deletions of the TWIST gene did not differ from those 
with intragenic TWIST mutations in frequency or severity of craniofacial
abnormalities. However, they did distinguish themselves by the presence of many
additional anomalies and diseases and--most importantly--the high frequency of
mental retardation, which was borderline significant. The authors conclude that
when using stringent inclusion criteria for studies of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, 
patients who have a pathogenic mutation of the TWIST gene should be excluded.

Foxc1 integrates Fgf and Bmp signalling independently of twist or noggin during
calvarial bone development.

Helsinki, Finland. ritva.rice@kcl.ac.uk

Calvarial bone and suture development is under complex regulation where bone
morphogenetic protein (Bmp) and fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signalling
interact with Msx2/Twist and Noggin and regulate frontal bone primordia
proliferation and suture fusion, respectively. We have shown previously that the 
winged helix transcription factor Foxc1, which is necessary for calvarial bone
development, is required for the Bmp regulation of Msx2. We now show that FGF2
regulates the expression of Foxc1, indicating that Foxc1 integrates Bmp and Fgf
signalling pathways. We also show that Foxc1 is not needed for the acquisition of
osteogenic potential or for the differentiation of osteoblasts. The expression of
Fgf receptors and Twist were normal in Foxc1-deficient calvarial mesenchyme, and 
ectopic FGF2 was able to induce the expression Osteopontin. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that Foxc1 does not participate in the regulation of Noggin
expression. Our findings indicate that Foxc1 integrates the Bmp and Fgf
signalling pathways independently of Twist or Noggin. This signalling network is 
essential for the correct patterning and growth of calvarial bones.

The identification of genes as markers for chromosome aberrations in specific
tumors might facilitate oncogenesis mechanism comprehension, cancer detection,
prediction of clinical outcomes, and response to therapy. Previous physiologic
and oncologic data identified the TWIST gene as a marker for mesodermal
derivative and bone tissue differentiation, but its contribution to bone
malignancies has not been investigated. In the present study, search for genomic 
alterations in high-grade pediatric osteosarcomas was focused on the 7p21 region,
and more specifically on the TWIST gene. In a cohort of 74 patients, we observed 
by allelotyping that 31 of 68 informative tumors were rearranged at the TWIST
locus. Among them, analysis by quantitative PCR (QPCR) revealed that,
surprisingly, mostly deletions (22/68), but also amplifications (9/68), of the
TWIST gene were detected. Furthermore, deletions at TWIST were statistically
correlated to other molecular abnormalities, like alterations at the APC or c-kit
loci, as well as to clinical features such as a poor outcome. This work shows
that the TWIST gene seemed to be involved in high-grade pediatric osteosarcomas
and is a new marker with a possible initial predictive value.

The basic helix-loop-helix protein Twist, a transcriptional repressor, is
essential for embryogenesis in both invertebrates and vertebrates.
Haploinsufficiency of the human TWIST1 gene, which causes the craniosynostosis
disorder Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS), is related to failure to repress
transcription of CDKN1A (which encodes p21/WAF1/CIP1), promoting osteoblast
differentiation. We have examined the functional significance of natural TWIST1
variants present in craniosynostosis patients and in their healthy relatives.
Both deletion and duplication variants of the glycine-rich tract Gly5AlaGly5
inhibited E2A (E12/E47)-dependent transcription of CDKN1A to a similar degree as 
wild-type protein, indicating that the length of this glycine tract is not
critical for efficient transcriptional repression. We also evaluated a newly
identified heterozygous TWIST1 variant (c.115C>G, encoding p.Arg39Gly), located
within a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS), that was present in a child 
with mild SCS and her clinically unaffected father and grandmother. Unlike
wild-type protein, this mutant required cotransfected E12 to localize to the
nucleus, indicating that the NLS, including amino acid 39, is essential for
nuclear localization; inhibition of E2A-dependent transcription of CDKN1A
occurred normally. This analysis further dissects the structure-function
relationships of TWIST and corroborates with phenotypic observations of disease
expressivity.

BACKGROUND: Slug, Snail, and Twist are transcription factors that regulate the
expression of tumor suppressors such as E-cadherin. We examined the distribution 
and expression of these three molecules together with the methylation of the
Twist gene promoter in human breast cancer to elucidate their clinical
significance.
METHODS: Frozen sections from breast cancer primary tumors (tumor, n = 114;
background, n = 30) were immunostained with Slug, Snail, and Twist antibodies.
RNA was reverse-transcribed, quantified, and analyzed by quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction (Q-PCR). Results were expressed as copy number of transcript per
50 ng of RNA (standardized against beta-actin).
RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry revealed that all three molecules were stained in
mammary tissues, with an increase in Twist within tumor tissues; this was
supported by Q-PCR analysis. Q-PCR analysis showed that Slug was elevated with
increasing tumor grade and prognostic indices. Twist was elevated with increasing
nodal involvement (tumor-node-metastasis status). Conversely, Snail was reduced
in expression corresponding with prognostic indices and tumor grade. Increased
levels of Slug were associated with tumors from patients with metastatic disease 
or disease recurrence, and increased expression of Twist was associated with
tumors from patients who had died from breast cancer. It is interesting to note
that Snail expression was significantly reduced in patients with a poor outcome
and those who had node-positive tumors. In addition, tumors exhibited methylation
of the Twist promoter.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that all three transcription factors have
inappropriate expression in breast cancer and that this may play a part in the
progression of human breast tumors.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are the second most common birth defects (1 in 1000
live births) in the world. Periconceptional maternal folate supplementation
reduces NTD risk by 50-70%; however, studies of folate related and other
developmental genes in humans have failed to definitively identify a major causal
gene for NTD. The aetiology of NTDs remains unknown and both genetic and
environmental factors are implicated. We present findings from a microsatellite
based screen of 44 multiplex pedigrees ascertained through the NTD Collaborative 
Group. For the linkage analysis, we defined our phenotype narrowly by considering
individuals with a lumbosacral level myelomeningocele as affected, then we
expanded the phenotype to include all types of NTDs. Two point parametric
analyses were performed using VITESSE and HOMOG. Multipoint parametric and
nonparametric analyses were performed using ALLEGRO. Initial results identified
chromosomes 7 and 10, both with maximum parametric multipoint lod scores (Mlod)
>2.0. Chromosome 7 produced the highest score in the 24 cM interval between
D7S3056 and D7S3051 (parametric Mlod 2.45; nonparametric Mlod 1.89). Further
investigation demonstrated that results on chromosome 7 were being primarily
driven by a single large pedigree (parametric Mlod 2.40). When this family was
removed from analysis, chromosome 10 was the most interesting region, with a peak
Mlod of 2.25 at D10S1731. Based on mouse human synteny, two candidate genes
(Meox2, Twist1) were identified on chromosome 7. A review of public databases
revealed three biologically plausible candidates (FGFR2, GFRA1, Pax2) on
chromosome 10. The results from this screen provide valuable positional data for 
prioritisation of candidate gene assessment in future studies of NTDs.

A role for fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 in the altered osteoblast
phenotype induced by Twist haploinsufficiency in the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.

Genetic mutations of Twist, a bHLH transcription factor, induce premature fusion 
of cranial sutures (craniosynostosis) in the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS). The 
mechanisms by which Twist haploinsufficiency may alter osteoblast differentiation
are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of fibroblast
growth factor receptor-2 (Fgfr2) in the abnormal osteoblast differentiation in
SCS. Cranial osteoblasts from an SCS patient with a Y103X mutation inducing
deletion of the Twist bHLH domain showed decreased Fgfr2 mRNA levels associated
with decreased expression of Runx2, bone sialoprotein (BSP) and osteocalcin (OC),
markers of differentiated osteoblasts, compared with wild-type osteoblasts.
Transfection with Twist or Runx2 expression vectors, but not with Runx2 mutant
which impairs DNA binding, restored Fgfr2, Runx2, BSP and OC expression in Twist 
mutant osteoblasts. EMSA analysis of mutant osteoblast nuclear extracts showed
reduced Runx2 binding to a target OSE2 site in the Fgfr2 promoter. ChIP analyses 
showed that both Twist and Runx2 in mutant osteoblast nuclear extracts bind to a 
specific region in the Fgfr2 promoter. Significantly, forced expression of Fgfr2 
restored Runx2 and osteoblast marker genes, whereas a dominant-negative Fgfr2
further decreased Runx2 and downstream genes in Twist mutant osteoblasts,
indicating that alteration of Fgfr2 results in downregulation of osteoblast genes
in Twist mutant osteoblasts. We conclude that Twist haploinsufficiency
downregulates Fgfr2 mRNA expression, which in turn reduces Runx2 and downstream
osteoblast-specific genes in human calvarial osteoblasts. This provides genetic
and biochemical evidence for a role of Fgfr2 in the altered osteoblast phenotype 
induced by Twist haploinsufficiency in the SCS.

Linkage disequilibrium analysis identifies an FGFR1 haplotype-tag SNP associated

Technology, GPO Box 2434, Brisbane, QLD 4001, Australia.

Mutations in FGFR1 and TWIST1 have been reported to affect the timing of
calvarial suture fusion resulting in craniosynostosis and facial abnormalities.
We screened nonpathologic populations for genetic polymorphisms that may
associate with normal craniofacial variation. We identified 17 single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in FGFR1, 6 of which were novel (g.8591855G-->A,
g.8593685G-->A, g.8602303C-->T, g.8602475A-->G (p.Ile293Val), g.8605849C-->T,
g.8607868G-->A). No SNPs were found in TWIST1. FGFR1 SNP haplotypes were
reconstructed for Caucasian, Asian, Australian Aboriginal, and African American
populations. All populations shared two linkage disequilibrium blocks, with one
haplotype-tag SNP (htSNP) tagging each block. The htSNP g.8592931G-->C was found 
to have a significant negative correlation with the cephalic index for all
populations (R = -0.187, p = 0.036), with larger correlations in Asians and
females. This finding is a starting point in the identification of a set of SNPs 
that can be genotyped to determine both normal and disease craniofacial
phenotypes.

In vitro differentiation profile of osteoblasts derived from patients with
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Oral Biology, University of Washington, Seattle, 98195, USA.

Seathre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS) is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis
syndrome, associated with loss-of-function mutations in the basic
helix-loop-helix transcription factor, TWIST1. The biologic activity of TWIST1
has been implicated in the inhibition of differentiation of multiple cell
lineages. Therefore, premature fusion of cranial sutures (craniosynostosis) in
SCS may be mediated by altered differentiation of calvarial osteoblasts. In this 
study, we evaluated osteoblasts derived from calvarial bone of three patients
with SCS and three unaffected individuals as controls to investigate the
principle stages of osteoblast differentiation: (1) proliferation, (2) matrix
maturation, and (3) mineralization. Using a BrdU-Hoechst flow cytometry assay, we
found that the percent of proliferating cells was significantly reduced in cells 
derived from patients with SCS compared with those derived from controls (P < or 
= 0.05). In the matrix maturation stage, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme
activity and the expression of extracellular matrix genes, collagen I alpha 2
(COL1A2), osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OC), and the runt-related transcription
factor RUNX2 were examined by enzymatic assay and real-time quantitative RT-PCR, 
respectively. We identified no significant differences in the expression of
matrix related transcripts. However, we found significant reductions in ALP
activity on days 3 and 7 and in RUNX2 expression on days 14 and 21 (P < or =
0.05). Quantitative alizarin red S mineralization assays showed a trend toward
increased mineralization in osteoblasts derived from patients with SCS at days 21
and 28, although not statistically significant. Our results demonstrated that
loss-of-function mutations of TWIST1 led to reduced proliferation regardless of
the functional domain affected. We did not find any conclusive differences in
matrix maturation or mineralization in these primary osteoblasts. It is plausible
that mutations in different functional domains of TWIST1 have divergent effects
on these later stages of differentiation.

Deletion involving the TWIST locus and the HOXA cluster: a contiguous gene

Deletion of TWIST on 7p21 leads to Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, whereas deletion of 
the HOXA cluster on 7p15.2 leads to hand-foot-genital syndrome. We report here a 
patient with 46,XY,del(7)(p15.2p21) who had craniosynostosis, maxillary
hypoplasia, prominent ear crus, rectoperineal fistula, and hypoplastic fifth
fingers. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we demonstrated the deletion
to encompass the TWIST locus and the HOXA cluster. We suggest that many, if not
all, of the features of this patient could be accounted for by combined
haploinsufficiency of the TWIST and HOXA cluster. Hence, the patient's phenotype 
may define a new contiguous gene syndrome on 7p.

Twist, a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix class, has been
suggested to have oncogenic properties. We reported Twist expression was
regulated by Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and that both Wnt-1 and Twist could
contribute to mammary tumorigenesis. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the
expression of Twist, Wnt-1 and Wnt-2 in human breast cancer tissue. We examined
the expression in patients with breast cancer by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.
RT-PCR of twenty-three pairs of cancer and normal breast tissue revealed that
Twist was up-regulated in 69.6% (16/23) of the cancer lesions and 21.7% (5/23) of
the normal breast tissues. Wnt-2 was up-regulated in all of the cancer lesions
and 13.0% (3/23) of the normal breast tissues, whereas Wnt-1 was expressed in
both the cancer and normal breast tissues of the five cases examined.
Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that Twist was positively expressed in
52.2% (12/23) of the cancer lesions and 34.8% (8/23) of the normal breast
tissues. Twist and Wnt-2 are highly expressed in breast cancer tissue, suggesting
that both molecules could play important roles in mammary carcinogenesis.

Autosomal dominant mutations in the gene encoding the basic helix-loop-helix
transcription factor Twist1 are associated with limb and craniofacial defects in 
humans with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. The molecular mechanism underlying these
phenotypes is poorly understood. We show that ectopic expression of the related
basic helix-loop-helix factor Hand2 phenocopies Twist1 loss of function in the
limb and that the two factors have a gene dosage-dependent antagonistic
interaction. Dimerization partner choice by Twist1 and Hand2 can be modulated by 
protein kinase A- and protein phosphatase 2A-regulated phosphorylation of
conserved helix I residues. Notably, multiple Twist1 mutations associated with
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome alter protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of
Twist1, suggesting that misregulation of Twist1 dimerization through either
stoichiometric or post-translational mechanisms underlies phenotypes of
individuals with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.

Loss of imprinting (LOI) of the insulin-like growth factor II gene (IGF2) is an
epigenetic alteration that results in a modest increase in IGF2 expression, and
it is present in the normal colonic mucosa of about 30% of patients with
colorectal cancer. To investigate its role in intestinal tumorigenesis, we
created a mouse model of Igf2 LOI by crossing female H19+/- mice with male
Apc+/Min mice. Mice with LOI developed twice as many intestinal tumors as did
control littermates. Notably, these mice also showed a shift toward a less
differentiated normal intestinal epithelium, reflected by an increase in crypt
length and increased staining with progenitor cell markers. A similar shift in
differentiation was seen in the normal colonic mucosa of humans with LOI. Thus,
altered maturation of nonneoplastic tissue may be one mechanism by which
epigenetic changes affect cancer risk.

BACKGROUND: DNA methylation changes are an early event in carcinogenesis and are 
often present in the precursor lesions of various cancers. We examined whether
DNA methylation changes might be used as markers of cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia (CIN) and invasive cervical cancer (ICC).
METHODS: We used methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to analyze 
promoter hypermethylation of 20 genes, selected on the basis of their role in
cervical cancer, in 319 exfoliated cell samples and matched tissue biopsy
specimens collected during two studies of Senegalese women with increasingly
severe CIN and ICC (histology negative/atypical squamous cells of undetermined
significance [ASCUS] = 142, CIN-1 = 39, CIN-2 = 23, CIN-3/carcinoma in situ [CIS]
= 23, ICC = 92). Logic regression was used to determine the best set of candidate
genes to use as disease markers. All statistical tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: Similar promoter methylation patterns were seen in genes from exfoliated
cell samples and corresponding biopsy specimens. For four genes (CDH13, DAPK1,
RARB, and TWIST1), the frequency of hypermethylation increased statistically
significantly with increasing severity of neoplasia present in the cervical
biopsy (P<.001 for each). By using logic regression, we determined that the best 
panel of hypermethylated genes included DAPK1, RARB, or TWIST1. At least one of
the three genes was hypermethylated in 57% of samples with CIN-3/CIS and in 74%
of samples with ICC but in only 5% of samples with CIN-1 or less. The estimated
specificity of the three-gene panel was 95%, and its sensitivity was 74% (95%
confidence interval [CI] = 73% to 75%) for ICC and 52% (95% CI = 49% to 55%) for 
CIN-3/CIS. By extrapolation, we estimated that, among Senegalese women presenting
to community-based clinics, detection of the DAPK1, RARB, or TWIST1
hypermethylated gene would reveal histologically confirmed CIN-3 or worse with a 
sensitivity of 60% (95% CI = 57% to 63%) and a specificity of 95% (95% CI = 94%
to 95%).
CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant promoter methylation analysis on exfoliated cell samples is
a potential diagnostic tool for cervical cancer screening that potentially may be
used alone or in conjunction with cytology and/or human papillomavirus testing.

Twist induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition to facilitate tumor
metastasis.

Tumor metastasis-the spreading of primary tumor cells to distal organs - is the
major cause of death of cancer patients. The metastatic process consists of four 
distinct steps, invasion, intravasation, extravasation, and metastatic growth,
and primary tumor cells need to acquire different genetic characteristics to
accomplish each step. The main players during the metastatic process remain,
however, largely unknown. A recent report in Cell by Robert Weinberg's group
(Yang et al., Cell 2004;117:927-39) adds the transcription factor Twist to the
list of metastatis regulators. Suppression of Twist expression in tumor cells
inhibits the metastatic potential, whereas its overexpression induces an
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in epithelial cells. This study provides 
direct evidence that EMT may be an essential process during metastasis and should
appropriately stimulate further investigations of EMT in many laboratories.

Oncogenic cooperation between H-Twist and N-Myc overrides failsafe programs in
cancer cells.

N-Myc oncogene amplification is a frequent event in neuroblastoma and is strongly
correlated with advanced disease stage and treatment failure. Similarly to c-Myc 
oncogenic activation, N-Myc deregulation promotes both cell proliferation and
p53-dependent apoptosis by sensitizing cells to a variety of insults.
Intriguingly, p53 mutations are uncommon in neuroblastomas, strongly suggesting
that an alternative cooperating event circumvents this safeguard against
oncogene-driven neoplasia. By performing a pangenomic cDNA microarray analysis,
we demonstrate that human Twist is constantly overexpressed in N-Myc-amplified
neuroblastomas. H-Twist overexpression is responsible for the inhibition of the
ARF/p53 pathway involved in the Myc-dependent apoptotic response. This oncogenic 
cooperation of two key regulators of embryogenesis causes cell transformation and
malignant outgrowth.

Snail, a zinc-finger transcriptional repressor, is essential for mesoderm and
neural crest cell formation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The basic
helix-loop-helix transcription factors E2A and Twist have been linked with Snail 
during embryonic development. In this study, we examined the role of Snail in
cellular differentiation through regulation of p21(WAF/CIP1) expression. A
reporter assay with the p21 promoter demonstrated that Snail inhibited expression
of p21 induced by E2A. Co-expression of Snail with Twist showed additive
inhibitory effects. Deletion mutants of the p21 promoter revealed that sequences 
between -270 and -264, which formed a complex with unidentified nuclear
factor(s), were critical for E2A and Snail function. The E2A-dependent expression
of the endogenous p21 gene was also inhibited by Snail.

HOXA5-twist interaction alters p53 homeostasis in breast cancer cells.

The homeotic gene HOXA5 has been shown to play an important role in breast
tumorigenesis. We have shown that loss of p53 correlated with loss of a
developmentally regulated transcription factor, HOXA5, in primary breast cancer. 
Searching for potential protein interacting partners we found that HOXA5 binds to
an anti-apoptotic protein, Twist. Furthermore, Twist-overexpressing MCF-7 cells
displayed a deregulated p53 response to gamma-radiation and decreased regulation 
of downstream target genes. Using a p53-promoter-reporter system, we demonstrated
that HOXA5 could partially restore the inhibitory effects of Twist on p53 target 
genes. These effects are likely mediated through both the transcriptional
up-regulation of p53 and the protein-protein interaction between HOXA5 and Twist.
Thus, the loss of HOXA5 expression could lead to the functional activation of
Twist resulting in aberrant cell cycle regulation and promoting breast
carcinogenesis.

Sézary syndrome (Sz) is a malignancy of CD4+ memory skin-homing T cells and
presents with erythroderma, lymphadenopathy, and peripheral blood involvement. To
gain more insight into the molecular features of Sz, oligonucleotide array
analysis was performed comparing gene expression patterns of CD4+ T cells from
peripheral blood of patients with Sz with those of patients with erythroderma
secondary to dermatitis and healthy controls. Using unsupervised hierarchical
clustering gene, expression patterns of T cells from patients with Sz were
classified separately from those of benign T cells. One hundred twenty-three
genes were identified as significantly differentially expressed and had an
average fold change exceeding 2. T cells from patients with Sz demonstrated
decreased expression of the following hematopoietic malignancy-linked tumor
suppressor genes: TGF-beta receptor II, Mxi1, Riz1, CREB-binding protein, BCL11a,
STAT4, and Forkhead Box O1A. Moreover, the tyrosine kinase receptor EphA4 and the
potentially oncogenic transcription factor Twist were highly and selectively
expressed in T cells of patients with Sz. High expression of EphA4 and Twist was 
also observed in lesional skin biopsy specimens of a subset of patients with
cutaneous T cell lymphomas related to Sz, whereas their expression was nearly
undetectable in benign T cells or in skin lesions of patients with inflammatory
dermatoses. Detection of EphA4 and Twist may be used in the molecular diagnosis
of Sz and related cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Furthermore, the membrane-bound
EphA4 receptor may serve as a target for directed therapeutic intervention.

Tumor-associated E-cadherin mutations do not induce Wnt target gene expression,
but affect E-cadherin repressors.

E-cadherin is a cell-cell adhesion molecule and tumor invasion suppressor gene
that is frequently altered in human cancers. It interacts through its cytoplasmic
domain with beta-catenin which in turn interacts with the Wnt (wingless)
signaling pathway. We have compared the effects of different tumor-derived
E-cadherin variants with those of normal E-cadherin on Wnt signaling and on genes
involved in epithelial mesenchymal transition. We established an in-house cDNA
microarray composed of 1105 different, sequence verified cDNA probes
corresponding to 899 unique genes that represent the majority of genes known to
be involved in cadherin-dependent cell adhesion and signaling
('Adhesion/Signaling Array'). The expression signatures of E-cadherin-negative
MDA-MB-435S cancer cells transfected with E-cadherin variants (in frame deletions
of exon 8 or 9, D8 or D9, respectively, or a point mutation in exon 8 (D370A))
were compared to that of wild-type E-cadherin (WT) transfected cells. From the
differentially expressed genes, we selected 38 that we subsequently analyzed by
quantitative real-time RT-PCR and/or Northern Blot. A total of 92% of these were 
confirmed as differentially expressed. Most of these genes encode proteins of the
cytoskeleton, cadherins/integrins, oncogenes and matrix metalloproteases. No
significant expression differences of genes downstream of the Wnt-pathway were
found, except in E-cadherin D8 transfected cells where upregulation of three
Tcf/Lef-transcribed genes was seen. One possible reason for the lack of
expression differences of the Tcf/Lef-regulated genes is upregulation of SFRP1
and SFRP3; both of which are competitive inhibitors of the Wnt proteins.
Interestingly, known E-cadherin transcriptional repressors, such as SLUG (SNAI2),
SIP1 (ZEB2), TWIST1, SNAIL (SNAI1) and ZEB1 (TCF8), but not E12/E47 (TCF3), had a
lack of upregulation in cells expressing mutated E-cadherin compared to WT. In
conclusion, E-cadherin mutations have no influence on expression of genes
involved in Wnt-signaling, but they may promote their own expression by blocking 
upregulation of E-cadherin repressors.

Affymetrix and spotted oligonucleotide microarrays were used to assess global
differential gene expression comparing normal human melanocytes with six
independent melanoma cell strains from advanced lesions. The data, validated at
the protein level for selected genes, confirmed the overexpression in melanoma
cells relative to normal melanocytes of several genes in the growth
factor/receptor family that confer growth advantage and metastasis. In addition, 
novel pathways and patterns of associated expression in melanoma cells not
reported before emerged, including the following: (a) activation of the NOTCH
pathway; (b) increased Twist expression and altered expression of additional
transcriptional regulators implicated in embryonic development and
epidermal/mesenchymal transition; (c) coordinated activation of cancer/testis
antigens; (d) coordinated down-regulation of several immune modulation genes, in 
particular in the IFN pathways; (e) down-regulation of several genes implicated
in membrane trafficking events; and (f) down-regulation of growth suppressors,
such as the Prader-Willi gene NECDIN, whose function was confirmed by
overexpression of ectopic Flag-necdin. Validation of differential expression
using melanoma tissue microarrays showed that reduced ubiquitin COOH-terminal
esterase L1 in primary melanoma is associated with worse outcome and that
increased expression of the basic helix-loop-helix protein Twist is associated
with worse outcome. Some differentially expressed genes reside on chromosomal
regions displaying common loss or gain in melanomas or are known to be regulated 
by CpG promoter methylation. These results provide a comprehensive view of
changes in advanced melanoma relative to normal melanocytes and reveal new
targets that can be used in assessing prognosis, staging, and therapy of melanoma
patients.

Molecular analysis of patients with synostotic frontal plagiocephaly (unilateral 
coronal synostosis).

Mutations in genes known to be responsible for most of the recognizable syndromes
associated with bilateral coronal synostosis can be detected by molecular
testing. The genetic alterations that could cause unilateral coronal synostosis
are more elusive. It is recognized that FGFR and TWIST mutations can give rise to
either bilateral or unilateral coronal synostosis, even in the same family. The
authors undertook a prospective study of patients presenting with synostotic
frontal plagiocephaly (unilateral coronal synostosis) to Children's Hospital
Boston during the period from 1997 to 2000. Mutational analysis was performed on 
all patients and on selected parents whenever familial transmission was
suspected. Intraoperative anthropometry was used in an effort to differentiate
those patients in whom a mutation was detected from those in whom it was not. The
anthropometric measures included bilateral sagittal orbital-globe distance, inter
medial canthal distance, and nasal angulation. Macrocephaly and palpebral
angulation were also considered possible determinants. There was a 2:1 female
preponderance in 47 patients with synostotic frontal plagiocephaly. Mutations
were found in eight of 47 patients: two patients with different single-amino-acid
changes in FGFR2, three patients with FGFR3 Pro250Arg, and three patients with
TWIST mutations. Another patient had craniofrontonasal syndrome for which a
causative locus has been mapped to chromosome X, although molecular testing is
not yet available. Two features were strongly associated with a detectable
mutation in patients with synostotic frontal plagiocephaly: asymmetrical
brachycephaly (retrusion of both supraorbital rims) and orbital hypertelorism.
Other abnormalities in the craniofacial region and extremities were clues to a
particular mutation in FGFR2, FGFR3, TWIST, or the X-linked mutation. Neither
macrocephaly nor degree of nasal angulation nor relative vertical position of the
lateral canthi correlated with mutational detection. An additional four patients 
in this study had either unilateral or bilateral coronal synostosis in an
immediate relative and had anthropometric findings that predicted a mutation, and
yet no genetic alteration was found. This suggests either that the authors'
screening methods were not sufficiently sensitive or that perhaps there are other
unknown pathogenic loci. Nevertheless, molecular testing is recommended for
infants who have unilateral coronal synostosis, particularly if there are the
anthropometric findings highlighted in this study or an otherwise suspicious
feature in the child or a parent. Infants with either an identified or a
suspected mutation usually need bilateral asymmetric advancement of the bandeau
and may be more likely to require frontal revision in childhood.

Neoexpression of N-cadherin in E-cadherin positive colon cancers.

In our study, we aimed to investigate the expression of N-cadherin and E-cadherin
and their dependency on epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulators SNAI1, SIP1 
and TWIST in human colon cancer. Expression of E-cadherin and N-cadherin was
examined by immunohistochemistry in 80 colon carcinomas by using paraffin
embedded and formalin fixed tissues. Those cases were partly analyzed for mRNA
expression of N-cadherin (42 cases), TWIST (18 cases), SNAI1 (25 cases) and SIP1 
(25 cases) by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Additionally, colon carcinomas that 
showed amplification of 20q13, the localization of the human SNAI1 gene, were
examined. We found cytoplasmic and/or membrane-associated immunoreactivity of
N-cadherin in 35/80 (44%) of the cases. However, there was no correlation to
upregulated TWIST mRNA levels, as we have shown previously for diffuse-type
gastric cancers with abnormal N-cadherin expression. Reduced and/or cytoplasmic
E-cadherin immunoreactivity was detected in 19% (15/80) of the cases. Expression 
of SNAI1 or SIP1 mRNA was not seen in any of the 25 cases analyzed. There was no 
correlation between amplification of 20q13 and SNAI1 mRNA expression. Remarkably,
N-cadherin was almost exclusively expressed in those cases showing normal
E-cadherin immunoreactivity, suggesting a mutual exclusion between abnormal
E-cadherin reduction and upregulation of N-cadherin. For the first time, we
postulate a role for N-cadherin in primary colon cancer progression, which may be
similar to the effect discovered by others in breast cancer cell lines, where
coexpressed N-cadherin can exert a dominant function over E-cadherin's adhesive
function and thus promote tumor invasiveness.

Metastasis is a multistep process during which cancer cells disseminate from the 
site of primary tumors and establish secondary tumors in distant organs. In a
search for key regulators of metastasis in a murine breast tumor model, we have
found that the transcription factor Twist, a master regulator of embryonic
morphogenesis, plays an essential role in metastasis. Suppression of Twist
expression in highly metastatic mammary carcinoma cells specifically inhibits
their ability to metastasize from the mammary gland to the lung. Ectopic
expression of Twist results in loss of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion,
activation of mesenchymal markers, and induction of cell motility, suggesting
that Twist contributes to metastasis by promoting an epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT). In human breast cancers, high level of Twist expression is
correlated with invasive lobular carcinoma, a highly infiltrating tumor type
associated with loss of E-cadherin expression. These results establish a
mechanistic link between Twist, EMT, and tumor metastasis.

Alx4 and Msx2 play phenotypically similar and additive roles in skull vault
differentiation.

Antonopoulou I(1), Mavrogiannis LA, Wilkie AO, Morriss-Kay GM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Human Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.

Alx4 and Msx2 encode homeodomain-containing transcription factors that show a
clear functional overlap. In both mice and humans, loss of function of either
gene is associated with ossification defects of the skull vault, although the
major effect is on the frontal bones in mice and the parietal bones in humans.
This study was undertaken to discover whether Alx4 and Msx2 show a genetic
interaction in skull vault ossification, and to test the hypothesis that they
interact with the pathway that includes the Fgfr genes, Twist1 and Runx2. We
generated Alx4(+/-)/Msx2(+/-) double heterozygous mutant mice, interbred them to 
produce compound genotypes and analysed the genotype-phenotype relationships.
Loss of an increasing number of alleles correlated with an incremental
exacerbation of the skull vault defect; loss of Alx4 function had a marginally
greater effect than loss of Msx2 and also affected skull thickness. In situ
hybridization showed that Alx4 and Msx2 are expressed in the cranial skeletogenic
mesenchyme and in the growing calvarial bones. Studies of the coronal suture
region at embryonic day (E)16.5 revealed that Alx4 expression was decreased, but 
not abolished, in Msx2(-/-) mutants, and vice versa; expression of Fgfr2 and
Fgfr1, but not Twist1, was reduced in both mutants at the same stage. Runx2
expression was unaffected in the coronal suture; in contrast, expression of the
downstream ossification marker Spp1 was delayed. Double homozygous pups showed
substantial reduction of alkaline phosphatase expression throughout the
mineralized skull vault; they died at birth due to defects of the heart, lungs
and diaphragm not previously associated with Alx4 or Msx2. Our observations
suggest that Alx4 and Msx2 are partially functionally redundant, acting within a 
network of transcription factors and signalling events that regulate the rate of 
osteogenic proliferation and differentiation at a stage after the commitment of
mesenchymal stem cells to osteogenesis.

Clinical findings in four Brazilian families affected by Saethre-Chotzen syndrome
without TWIST mutations.

Nascimento SR(1), de Mello MP, Batista JC, Balarin MA, Lopes VL.

Author information: 
(1)Faculdade de Ciências Médicas, Departamento de Genética Médica, Universidade
Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the dysmorphological variability and to investigate the
presence of mutations in the exon 1 of TWIST gene using direct sequencing in
Brazilian families presenting with Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome (SCS).
METHODS: Four families with 24 patients diagnosed as having features of SCS were 
studied. Phenotypic characteristics of all patients were inventoried. The
investigation protocol included anamnesis, dysmorphological examination,
abdominal ultrasound, spine and cranium x-ray, chromosomal analysis on GTG
banding, and screening for mutations in the exon 1 of TWIST gene.
RESULTS: Frequent facial features included brachycephaly (24 of 24), facial
asymmetry (20 of 24), prominent ears crus (15 of 24), low-set ears (14 of 24),
maxillary hypoplasia (13 of 24), prominent nasal bridge (13 of 24), ptosis of the
eyelids (12 of 24), and low-set frontal hairline (12 of 24). Limb abnormalities
such as partial hand cutaneous syndactyly (18 of 24), clinodactyly (13 of 24),
and broad great toes (13 of 24), and partial cutaneous syndactyly of the feet (9 
of 24) were also detected. Among radiological findings were relevant bicoronal
(eight of nine) and unicoronal (one of nine) craniosynostosis, digital
impressions (eight of nine), bilateral parietal foramina (two of nine), partial
fusion 1 and 2 degrees costal arches (two of nine) and bifid spine on lumbar
vertebra (two of nine). GTG-banding chromosomal analyses were normal. No TWIST
gene mutations were found.
CONCLUSIONS: Affected individuals in these four SCS families may carry mutations 
in other genes of the same developmental pathway. Considering the complexity of
the genes involved in skull-limbs development, an accurate dysmorphological
evaluation in patients with SCS and their families is especially important for
genetic counseling.

Very high frequency of hypermethylated genes in breast cancer metastasis to the
bone, brain, and lung.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21231, USA.

PURPOSE: Most often it is not the primary tumor, but metastasis to distant organs
that results in the death of breast cancer patients. To characterize molecular
alterations in breast cancer metastasis, we investigated the frequency of
hypermethylation of five genes (Cyclin D2, RAR-beta, Twist, RASSF1A, and HIN-1)
in metastasis to four common sites: lymph node, bone, brain, and lung.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Methylation-specific PCR for the five genes was performed on
DNA extracted from archival paraffin-embedded specimens of paired primary breast 
cancer and its lymph nodes (LN) metastasis (n = 25 each); in independent samples 
of metastasis to the bone (n = 12), brain (n = 8), and lung (n = 10); and in
normal bone, brain, and lung (n = 22).
RESULTS: No hypermethylation was detected in the five genes in the normal host
tissues. In paired samples, LN metastasis had a trend of higher prevalence of
methylation compared with the primary breast carcinoma for all five genes with
significance for HIN-1 (P = 0.04). Compared with the primary breast carcinomas,
all five genes had higher methylation frequencies in the bone, brain, and lung
metastasis, with HIN-1 and RAR-beta methylation being significantly higher (P <
0.01) in each group. Loss of expression of all five genes correlated, with a few 
exceptions, to hypermethylation of their promoter sequences in metastatic
carcinoma cells microdissected from LNs.
CONCLUSION: The frequent presence of hypermethylated genes in locoregional and
distant metastasis could render them particularly susceptible to therapy targeted
toward gene reactivation combining demethylating agents, histone deacetylase
inhibitors, and/or differentiating agents.

Deletion of the TWIST gene in a large five-generation family.

(1)Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The
Netherlands. i.deheer@erasmusmc.nl

In this article, we describe a large five-generation family with characteristics 
of the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome as well as of the blepharophimosis ptosis
epicanthus inversus syndrome. Segregating with their phenotype is a deletion of
the chromosome 7p21 TWIST gene locus. The TWIST gene indeed is involved in
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, a craniosynostosis syndrome further characterized by
specific facial and limb abnormalities. However, only two members of our family
exhibited craniosynostosis. This report demonstrates that the genetics of
craniofacial anomalies are less straightforward than they sometimes appear to be.
Not only craniosynostosis, but also subtle facial deformities could be indicative
of an abnormality of the TWIST gene. In conclusion, the clinical spectrum of
genetic abnormalities of the TWIST gene is highly variable. We therefore
recommend that genetic analysis of the TWIST gene locus, including fluorescence
in situ hybridization, should be considered in familial cases of facial and
eyelid abnormalities without the presence of craniosynostosis.

Runx2 is necessary and sufficient for osteoblast differentiation, yet its
expression precedes the appearance of osteoblasts by 4 days. Here we show that
Twist proteins transiently inhibit Runx2 function during skeletogenesis. Twist-1 
and -2 are expressed in Runx2-expressing cells throughout the skeleton early
during development, and osteoblast-specific gene expression occurs only after
their expression decreases. Double heterozygotes for Twist-1 and Runx2 deletion
have none of the skull abnormalities observed in Runx2(+/-) mice, a Twist-2 null 
background rescues the clavicle phenotype of Runx2(+/-) mice, and Twist-1 or -2
deficiency leads to premature osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, Twist-1
overexpression inhibits osteoblast differentiation without affecting Runx2
expression. Twist proteins' antiosteogenic function is mediated by a novel
domain, the Twist box, which interacts with the Runx2 DNA binding domain to
inhibit its function. In vivo mutagenesis confirms the antiosteogenic function of
the Twist box. Thus, relief of inhibition by Twist proteins is a mandatory event 
precluding osteoblast differentiation.

Pluridigite ( Pdt) is a semi-dominant mutation obtained after a mutagenesis
experiment with ethyl-nitroso-urea (ENU). The mutant exhibits abnormal skeletal
pattern formation characterized by the formation of extra digits (polydactyly) in
the preaxial (anterior) part of the hindlimbs. The phenotype shows incomplete
penetrance, depending on the genetic background. In an F2 cross with C57BL/6, the
phenotype could not be associated with a single locus. Strong linkage was
observed with markers located on Chromosome (Chr) 12, in a 2-cM interval between 
D12Mit136 and D12Mit153. This region contains the Twist gene, and we show that
the [Pdt] phenotype is dependent upon a new allele of Twist. We further
identified that the whole Chr 4 is associated with the [Pdt] phenotype. The
Pluridigite phenotype thus results from the combination of a Twist mutant allele 
and at least two additional loci.

Identification of a novel function of TWIST, a bHLH protein, in the development
of acquired taxol resistance in human cancer cells.

Taxol is one of the widely used chemotherapeutic drugs against many types of
human cancer. While it is considered as one of the most effective anticancer
drugs, treatment failure often occurs due to development of acquired resistance. 
Therefore, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for
the development of drug resistance. Although it is generally believed that taxol 
induces cell death through interfering with microtubules leading to mitotic
arrest, recent evidence has suggested that taxol-induced cell death also occurs
through pathways independent of either microtubule or mitotic arrest. In this
study, we report the identification of a novel role for TWIST, a basic
helix-loop-helix protein, which plays a central role in cell type determination
and differentiation, during generation of acquired resistance to taxol in a
nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line, HNE1-T3, using comparative genome
hybridization (CGH) and subsequent RT-PCR and Western blotting. We found that
upregulation of TWIST was associated with cellular resistance to taxol but not
other drugs with different mechanisms of action. The fact that increased TWIST
protein levels were also associated with another microtubule-targeting anticancer
drug, vincristine, in four types of human cancer including nasopharyngeal,
bladder, ovarian and prostate, indicates that it may play a central role in the
resistance to microtubule-disrupting agents. In addition, ectopic expression of
TWIST into human cancer cells also led to increased resistance to both taxol and 
vincristine. Our results indicate a novel mechanism that leads to resistance to
microtubule-disrupting anticancer drugs through upregulation of TWIST. Our
evidence provides a therapeutic strategy to overcome acquired resistance through 
inactivation of TWIST expression in human cancer.

Recent advances in human molecular genetics have identified mutations in the
TWIST, FGFR-1, FGFR-2 and FGFR-3 genes to be important causes of
craniosynostosis. Despite this, however, mutations cannot be identified in the
majority of patients. This study reports the first comprehensive screen of
mutations in TWIST, FGFR-1, FGFR-2 and FGFR-3 genes in a cohort of patients with 
craniosynostosis. This has led to the identification of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome 
to be a new microdeletion disorder and reports the first example of a
gene-environment interaction leading to craniosynostosis. In addition,
investigation of the expression patterns of the Fgfr and Twist genes in the
normal developing mouse coronal suture has identified the TWIST protein to be
important in cranial suture initiation and biogenesis. These findings have
significant clinical implications and will form the basis of future attempts to
develop novel therapies aimed at inhibiting cranial suture fusion.

Little is known about epigenetic silencing of genes by promoter hypermethylation 
in lobular breast cancers. The promoter methylation status of 5 cancer-related
genes (RASSF1A, HIN-1, RAR-beta, Cyclin D2 and Twist) was evaluated in 2 types of
lobular cancers, in situ (LCIS) and invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC) (n = 32),
and compared to ductal in situ (DCIS) and invasive (IDC) breast cancers (n = 71).
By using methylation-specific PCR (MSP), 100% of ILC and 69% of LCIS cases were
found to have 1 or more hypermethylated genes among the panel of 5 genes
(compared to 100% IDC and 95% of DCIS). Two or more hypermethylated genes were
detected per tumor in 79% of invasive and 61% of in situ lobular carcinomas
compared to 81% of IDC and 77% of DCIS. By contrast, DNA from nearly all normal
reduction mammoplasty tissues (n = 8) was unmethylated for the 5 genes. The
methylation profiles of lobular vs. ductal carcinomas with respect to RASSF1A,
Cyclin D2, RARbeta, and Hin-1 genes were similar, suggesting that gene silencing 
by promoter hypermethylation is likely to be important in both groups of
diseases. Distinctly different, Twist was hyper- methylated less often in ILC
(16%, 3/19 cases) than in IDC (56%, 15/27 cases) (p = 0.01). These results
suggest that these 2 types of tumors share many common methylation patterns and
some molecular differences. Additional studies might lend further understanding
into the etiology and clinical behavior of this tumor type.

Msx2 and Twist cooperatively control the development of the neural crest-derived 
skeletogenic mesenchyme of the murine skull vault.

The flat bones of the vertebrate skull vault develop from two migratory
mesenchymal cell populations, the cranial neural crest and paraxial mesoderm. At 
the onset of skull vault development, these mesenchymal cells emigrate from their
sites of origin to positions between the ectoderm and the developing cerebral
hemispheres. There they combine, proliferate and differentiate along an
osteogenic pathway. Anomalies in skull vault development are relatively common in
humans. One such anomaly is familial calvarial foramina, persistent unossified
areas within the skull vault. Mutations in MSX2 and TWIST are known to cause
calvarial foramina in humans. Little is known of the cellular and developmental
processes underlying this defect. Neither is it known whether MSX2 and TWIST
function in the same or distinct pathways. We trace the origin of the calvarial
foramen defect in Msx2 mutant mice to a group of skeletogenic mesenchyme cells
that compose the frontal bone rudiment. We show that this cell population is
reduced not because of apoptosis or deficient migration of neural crest-derived
precursor cells, but because of defects in its differentiation and proliferation.
We demonstrate, in addition, that heterozygous loss of Twist function causes a
foramen in the skull vault similar to that caused by loss of Msx2 function. Both 
the quantity and proliferation of the frontal bone skeletogenic mesenchyme are
reduced in Msx2-Twist double mutants compared with individual mutants. Thus Msx2 
and Twist cooperate in the control of the differentiation and proliferation of
skeletogenic mesenchyme. Molecular epistasis analysis suggests that Msx2 and
Twist do not act in tandem to control osteoblast differentiation, but function at
the same epistatic level.

Increased risk for developmental delay in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is associated 
with TWIST deletions: an improved strategy for TWIST mutation screening.

The majority of patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome have mutations in the
TWIST gene, which codes for a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. Of the
genetic alterations identified in TWIST, nonsense mutations, frameshifts
secondary to small deletions or insertions, and large deletions implicate
haploinsufficiency as the pathogenic mechanism. We identified three novel
intragenic mutations and six deletions in our patients by using a new strategy to
screen for TWIST mutations. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification
with subsequent sequencing to identify point mutations and small insertions or
deletions in the coding region, and real-time PCR-based gene dosage analysis to
identify large deletions encompassing the gene, with confirmation by
microsatellite and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses. The size
of the deletions can also be analyzed by using the gene dosage assay with "PCR
walking" across the critical region. In 55 patients with features of
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, 11% were detected to have deletions by real-time gene
dosage analysis. Two patients had a translocation or inversion at least 260 kb 3'
of the gene, suggesting they had position-effect mutations. Of the 37 patients
with classic features of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, the overall detection rate for
TWIST mutations was 68%. The risk for developmental delay in patients with
deletions involving the TWIST gene is approximately 90% or eight times more
common than in patients with intragenic mutations.

Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of calvarial bones leading to an
abnormal head shape. The craniosynostosis syndromes are clinically heterogeneous 
with overlapping features, which make an accurate diagnosis difficult at times.
Although the clarification of a genetic lesion does not have a direct impact on
patient management in many cases, there is a significant benefit in providing
accurate prenatal diagnosis. Genetic counsellors are also able to offer better
risk estimates of recurrences to non-manifesting carriers and their extended
family members and for affected patients of reproductive age. Advances in gene
discovery have shown that craniosynostosis syndromes delineated on clinical
bases, with the possible exception of Apert syndrome, are genetically
heterogeneous, and mutations have been found in fibroblast growth factor
receptors (FGFR) 1, 2, 3 and TWIST. We surveyed 99 craniosynostosis patients at
the molecular level and found mutations in 50 of them. Six novel point mutations 
were identified: three in FGFR2 and three in TWIST. Two Saethre-Chotzen patients 
with TWIST microdeletions at 7p21 were also found. The other mutations identified
have been previously reported. In studying these 99 patients, we developed a
diagnostic strategy for craniosynostosis testing, where sequential analysis of
recurrent mutations was followed by selective sequencing. This algorithm makes
testing of craniosynostosis disorders more efficient and cost-effective.

The twist gene has been characterized for its role in myogenesis in several
species. In addition, in mammalian cultured cells, it has been shown that twist
is a potential oncogene antagonizing p53-dependent apoptosis. To study, in vivo, 
the role of twist in apoptosis and proliferation, we constructed transgenic
Drosophila lines allowing ectopic expression of different twist orthologs. We
report that: (i) Drosophila twist induces apoptosis and activates the reaper
promoter, (ii) nematode twist induces arrest of proliferation without apoptosis, 
and (iii) human twist retains its potentialities observed in mammalian cultured
cells and antagonizes Drosophila p53-dependent apoptosis. In addition, we show
that human twist is able to induce cell proliferation in Drosophila. Data suggest
that the pathway by which human twist antagonizes Drosophila p53 could be
conserved. These transgenic lines thus constitute a powerful tool to identify
targets and modifiers of human twist.

Smooth muscle alpha-actin gene requires two E-boxes for proper expression in vivo
and is a target of class I basic helix-loop-helix proteins.

Changes in the differentiated state of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) play a key role
in vascular diseases, yet the mechanisms controlling SMC differentiation are
still largely undefined. We addressed the role of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
proteins in SMC differentiation by first determining the role of two E-box
(CAnnTG) motifs, binding sites for bHLH proteins, in the transcriptional
regulation of the SMC differentiation marker gene, smooth muscle alpha-actin (SM 
alpha-actin), in vivo. Mutation of one or both E-boxes significantly reduced the 
expression of a -2560- to 2784-bp SM alpha-actin promoter/LacZ reporter gene in
vivo in transgenic mice. We then determined the potential role of class I bHLH
proteins, E12, E47, HEB, and E2-2, in SM alpha-actin regulation. In
cotransfection experiments, E12, HEB, and E2-2 activated the SM alpha-actin
promoter. Activation by HEB and E2-2 was synergistic with serum response factor. 
Additionally, the dominant-negative/inhibitory HLH proteins, Id2, Id3, and Twist,
inhibited both the E12 and serum response factor-induced activations of the SM
alpha-actin promoter. Finally, we demonstrated that E2A proteins (E12/E47)
specifically bound the E-box-containing region of the SM alpha-actin promoter in 
vivo in the context of intact chromatin in SMCs. Taken together, these results
provide the first evidence of E-box-dependent regulation of a SMC differentiation
marker gene in vivo in transgenic mice. Moreover, they demonstrate a potential
role for class I bHLH factors and their inhibitors, Id and Twist, in SM
alpha-actin regulation and suggest that these factors may play an important role 
in control of SMC differentiation and phenotypic modulation.

Craniosynostosis is a congenital developmental disorder involving premature
fusion of cranial sutures, often associated with multiple neurological
manifestations. The perspective of this group of disorders has changed
dramatically in the new era of molecular genetics. In the last decade a large
literature with new concepts in craniosynostosis has appeared. More than 100
syndromes associated with craniosynostosis have been described, and in about a
dozen, the molecular defect has been identified. Pediatric neurologists are less 
aware than geneticists, neurosurgeons, and craniofacial surgeons of these
changes. General concepts about craniosynostosis are here presented with updates 
of clinical and genetic aspects of well-defined syndromes such as Apert, Crouzon,
Pfeiffer, Saethre-Chotzen. Evidence of their relationship with fibroblast growth 
factor receptors (FGFRs) 1, 2, and 3, and with causative genes such as TWIST has 
been documented. New and other less common syndromes also are discussed. The
differences between positional and synostotic plagiocephaly are important, as
well as the cause of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. The prognosis and
neurological outcome of patients, including "benign" forms of craniosynostosis,
are other important aspects. Major advances have occurred in understanding
pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of craniosynostosis. The role of local
dura mater and apoptosis; modalities of imaging such as prenatal ultrasound and
three-dimensional and spiral CT have improved the accuracy in diagnosis, and the 
new approaches in surgical treatment involving efficient and less invasive
methods, are evidence of these advances.

The twist gene is implied in head morphogenesis, as human patients heterozygous
at TWIST and heterozygous M-twist mutant mice present similar cranial-facial
abnormalities. M-twist and TWIST are respectively unique genes, coding for a
B-HLH transcription factor. We identified twist coding sequences from 11 species 
representing 7 families of primates, report their conservation and genus-specific
amino acid substitutions, and present a tentative gene-tree of these sequences.
Amino acid changes result in natural Twist variants, which might contribute to
generating distinct head morphologies in species. These data suggest twist as a
molecular marker, which could be used to refine controversial classification.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) involving down-regulation of E-cadherin
is thought to play a fundamental role during early steps of invasion and
metastasis of carcinoma cells. The aim of our study was to elucidate the role of 
EMT regulators Snail, SIP1 (both are direct repressors of E-cadherin), and Twist 
(an activator of N-cadherin during Drosophila embryogenesis), in primary human
gastric cancers. Expression of Snail, SIP1, and Twist was analyzed in 48 gastric 
carcinomas by real-time quantitative RT-PCR in paraffin-embedded and
formalin-fixed tissues. The changes of expression levels of these genes in
malignant tissues compared to matched non-tumorous tissues were correlated with
the expression of E- and N-cadherin. From 28 diffuse-type gastric carcinomas
analyzed reduced E-cadherin expression was detected in 11 (39%) cases compared to
non-tumorous tissues. Up-regulated Snail could be found in 6 cases with reduced
or negative E-cadherin expression. However, there was no correlation to increased
SIP1 expression. Interestingly, we could detect abnormal expression of N-cadherin
mRNA in 6 cases, which was correlated with Twist overexpression in 4 cases. From 
20 intestinal-type gastric cancer samples reduced E-cadherin expression was found
in 12 (60%) cases, which was correlated to up-regulation of SIP1, since 10 of
these 12 cases showed elevated mRNA levels, whereas Snail, Twist, and N-cadherin 
were not up-regulated. We present the first study investigating the role of EMT
regulators in human gastric cancer and provide evidence that an increase in Snail
mRNA expression is associated with down-regulation of E-cadherin in diffuse-type 
gastric cancer. We detected abnormally positive or increased N-cadherin mRNA
levels in the same tumors, probably due to overexpression of Twist. SIP1
overexpression could not be linked to down-regulated E-cadherin in diffuse-type
tumors, but was found to be involved in the pathogenesis of intestinal-type
gastric carcinoma. We conclude that EMT regulators play different roles in
gastric carcinogenesis depending on the histological subtype.

Craniosynostosis caused by genetic factors includes a heterogeneous group of over
100 syndromes, most with autosomal dominant inheritance. Mutations in five genes 
(FGFR1-, -2, -3, TWIST, and MSX2) causing craniosynostosis as the main clinical
feature were described. In most of these conditions, there are also limb
malformations. We report a two-generation kindred segregating microcornea, optic 
nerve alterations and cataract since childhood, craniosynostosis, and distal limb
alterations, with a great clinical intrafamilial variability. The
ophthalmological problems here described seem to be unique to this genealogy
while similar feet alterations were apparently only described in two other
affected siblings with acro-cranial-facial dysostosis syndrome (ADS). However,
ADS has an autosomal recessive inheritance instead of the dominant pattern of the
present genealogy. The candidate exons of the five genes previously mentioned
were tested through sequencing analysis presenting normal results in all cases.
Therefore, clinical and laboratory analyses in our patients suggest that their
phenotype represents a new syndrome very likely caused by mutation in a gene
different from those studied.

The Saethre-Chotzen (SC) syndrome is characterized by increased osteogenesis and 
premature fusion of cranial sutures, resulting from mutations in TWIST, a basic
helix-loop-helix transcription factor. The molecular target genes for Twist in
osteoblasts are however unknown. We report here that TWIST haploinsufficiency in 
mutant osteoblasts reduces mRNA and protein levels for CBFA1/RUNX2, a specific
osteoblast transcription factor, during both osteoblast cell growth and in vitro 
osteogenesis. Moreover, this is associated with altered expression of major
osteoblast-specific genes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed
reduced-binding ability of Cbfa1 to its target OSE2 element in the osteocalcin
promoter in mutant osteoblasts. By contrast, TWIST inactivation does not hamper
Cbfa1 binding on a similar upstream element present in the alpha1(I) collagen
promoter in mutant osteoblasts. This provides the first evidence that TWIST
inactivation alters CBFA1/RUNX2 expression and Cbfa1 binding ability to the
osteocalcin promoter, indicating that CBFA1/RUNX2 is a target gene for TWIST in
human osteoblasts.

Craniosynostosis in Alagille syndrome.

Alagille syndrome is a multisystem developmental disorder with primary
involvement of the liver, heart, skeleton, eyes and facial structures, and
demonstrates highly variable expressivity with respect to all of the involved
systems. Alagille syndrome is caused by mutations in the Jagged1 gene. Jagged1 is
a ligand in the Notch signaling pathway that has been shown to regulate early
cell fate determination. Mutations in Jagged1 have been identified in
approximately 80% of patients with Alagille syndrome. We have recently identified
two patients with mutation proven Alagille syndrome who also had unilateral
coronal craniosynostosis. Both individuals were screened for mutations in
fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, 2, 3 and TWIST genes, all associated with
various types of craniosynostosis and no mutations were identified. The finding
of a conserved form of craniosynostosis in two unrelated patients with Alagille
syndrome and mutations in Jagged1 may indicate that Jagged1 plays a role in
cranial suture formation.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a common autosomal dominant form of craniosynostosis,
the premature fusion of the sutures of the calvarial bones of the skull. Most
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome cases are caused by haploinsufficiency for the TWIST
gene. Mice heterozygous for a null mutation of the Twist gene replicate certain
features of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, but have not been reported to exhibit
craniosynostosis. We demonstrate that Twist heterozygous mice exhibit fusions of 
the coronal suture and other cranial suture abnormalities, indicating that Twist 
heterozygous mice constitute a better animal model for Saethre-Chotzen syndrome
than was previously appreciated.

The authors investigated whether genetic and environmental factors influence risk
for sagittal craniosynostosis. Cases were ascertained from craniofacial clinics
in the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan region. Controls were recruited from the
Johns Hopkins newborn nursery and a large pediatric practice in Baltimore County.
Forty-two probands with isolated, nonsyndromic sagittal craniosynostosis born in 
the mid-Atlantic region were included in this analysis. Controls are infants born
in Maryland without any known birth defects (n = 182). Odds ratios (OR) and
corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Cases were genotyped
at several loci implicated in malformation syndromes including craniosynostosis. 
There were no elevated risks for craniosynostosis related to maternal or paternal
smoking or maternal vitamin usage. Case mothers consumed less alcohol (OR = 0.38,
95% CI = 0.17-0.85) and had less education than control mothers ( < 0.001). All
cases that were sequenced were negative for mutations at the following genes:
exon IIIa 755C->G, (exons IIIa and IIIc,), exon IIIa, and exon 1. These findings 
suggest that whereas TWIST and the genes are important for syndromic
craniosynostosis, they are unlikely to be involved in isolated sagittal
craniosynostosis. Parental education and alcohol consumption were associated with
sagittal craniosynostosis in this study.

Members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family play an 
essential role in multiple developmental processes. During neurogenesis, positive
and negative regulation by bHLH proteins is essential for proper development.
Here we report the identification and initial characterization of the bHLH gene, 
Neuronal twist (N-twist), named for its neural expression pattern and high
sequence homology and physical linkage to the mesodermal inhibitor, M-twist.
N-twist is expressed in the developing mouse central nervous system in the
midbrain, hindbrain, and neural tube. This neural expression is conserved in
invertebrates, as expression of the Drosophila ortholog of N-twist is also
restricted to the central nervous system. Like other bHLH family members, N-Twist
heterodimerizes with E protein and binds DNA at a consensus bHLH-binding site,
the E box. We show that N-Twist inhibits MASH1-dependent transcriptional
activation by sequestering E protein in a dominant negative fashion. Thus, these 
studies support the notion that N-Twist represents a novel negative regulator of 
neurogenesis.

A novel mechanism for the regulation of osteoblast differentiation: transcription
of periostin, a member of the fasciclin I family, is regulated by the bHLH
transcription factor, twist.

Periostin is a secreted protein that is highly expressed in early osteoblastic
cells in vitro and in periosteum and periodontal ligament tissues in vivo. It is 
known that periostin supports cellular adhesion and spreading in vitro. Although,
the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of periostin are poorly understood, 
gene-profiling data have revealed that overexpression of Twist, a basic
helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, resulted in increased periostin
expression as validated by Northern blot and reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses. Twist is an important transcription factor for 
cell type determination and differentiation and has been shown to play an
important regulatory role in early osteogenesis. In situ hybridization of mouse
calvarial bones indicated that periostin and Twist mRNA are co-localized at the
osteogenic fronts of calvarial bones. To characterize the 5' flanking region of
the periostin gene, primer extension was carried out to identify the
transcription start site, and DNA sequence analysis confirmed the presence of a
'Twist-box' response element. The results of electrophoretic mobility shift assay
(EMSA) using nuclear extracts of MC3T3-E1 cells revealed that Twist bound to the 
Twist-box sequence on the periostin promoter. In vivo footprinting experiments
using ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) indicated that the Twist-box sequence was
protected in undifferentiated MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts but not in differentiated
MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. To determine whether Twist actually regulates the periostin
expression, 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with the periostin
promoter construct and the human Twist expression vector. Reporter analysis
indicated that the periostin promoter activities were enhanced by overexpression 
of Twist. These data suggest that Twist can bind to the periostin promoter in
undifferentiated preosteoblasts and up-regulate periostin expression, consistent 
with the up-regulation of periostin expression by Twist as observed in the
gene-profiling data.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a common craniosynostosis syndrome characterized by
craniofacial and limb anomalies. Intragenic mutations of the TWIST gene within
7p21 have been identified as a cause of this disorder. There is phenotypic
overlap with other craniosynostosis syndromes, and intragenic mutations in FGFR2 
(fibroblast growth factor receptor 2) and FGFR3 (fibroblast growth factor
receptor 3) have been demonstrated in the other conditions. Furthermore, complete
gene deletions of TWIST have also been found in a significant proportion of
patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. We investigated 11 patients clinically
identified as having the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype and 4 patients with
craniosynostosis but without a clear diagnosis. Of the patients with the
Saethre-Chotzen phenotype, four were found to carry the FGFR3 P250R mutation,
three were found to be heterozygous for three different novel mutations in the
coding region of TWIST, and two were found to have a deletion of one copy of the 
entire TWIST gene. Developmental delay was a distinguishing feature of the
patients with deletions, compared to patients with intragenic mutations of TWIST,
in agreement with the results of Johnson et al. [1998: Am J Hum Genet
63:1282-1293]. No mutations were found for the four patients with
craniosynostosis without a clear diagnosis. Therefore, 9 of our 11 patients (82%)
with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype had detectable genetic changes in FGFR3 or
TWIST. We propose that initial screening for the FGFR3 P250R mutation, followed
by sequencing of TWIST and then fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for
deletion detection of TWIST, is sufficient to detect mutations in > 80% of
patients with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype.

Twist is a transcription factor that is required for mesodermal cell fates in all
animals studied to date. Mutations of this locus in humans have been identified
as the cause of the craniofacial disorder Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. The
Caenorhabditis elegans Twist homolog is required for the development of a subset 
of the mesoderm. A semidominant allele of the gene that codes for CeTwist, hlh-8,
has defects that occur earlier in the mesodermal lineage than a previously
studied null allele of the gene. The semidominant allele has a charge change
(E29K) in the basic DNA-binding domain of CeTwist. Surprisingly, the mutant
protein retains DNA-binding activity as both a homodimer and a heterodimer with
its partner E/Daughterless (CeE/DA). However, the mutant protein blocks the
activation of the promoter of a target gene. Therefore, the mutant CeTwist may
cause cellular defects as a dominant negative protein by binding to target
promoters as a homo- or heterodimer and then blocking transcription. Similar
phenotypes as those caused by the E29K mutation were observed when amino acid
substitutions in the DNA-binding domain that are associated with the human
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome were engineered into the C. elegans protein. These data 
suggest that Saethre-Chotzen syndrome may be caused, in some cases, by dominant
negative proteins, rather than by haploinsufficiency of the locus.

The general requirement to induce mesoderm and allocate cells into different
mesodermal tissues such as body muscle or heart is common in many animal embryos.
Since the discovery of the twist gene, there has been great progress toward
unraveling the molecular mechanisms that control mesoderm specification and
differentiation. Twist was first identified in Drosophila as a gene crucial for
proper gastrulation and mesoderm formation. In the fly embryo, Twist continues to
play additional roles, allocating mesodermal cells into the body wall muscle fate
and patterning a subset of these muscles. Twist is also required for proper
differentiation of the adult musculature. Twist homologues have been identified
in a great variety of organisms, which span the phylogenetic tree. These
organisms include other invertebrates such as jellyfish, nematode, leech and
lancelet as well as vertebrates such as frog, chick, fish, mouse and human. The
Twist family shares both homology in structure across the basic helix-loop-helix 
domain and in expression during mesoderm and muscle development in most species. 
Here we review the current state of knowledge of the Twist family and consider
how Twist functions during development. Moreover, we highlight experimental
evidence that shows common themes that Twist employs during specification and
patterning of the mesoderm among evolutionarily distant organisms. Conserved
principles and the molecular mechanisms underlying them are discussed.

Histone acetylation and recruitment of serum responsive factor and CREB-binding
protein onto SM22 promoter during SM22 gene expression.

Chromatin acetylation and deacetylation catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases
(HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) are closely related to eukaryotic gene
transcription. Although the binding of serum response factor (SRF) to the CArG
boxes in the promoter region is necessary for SM22 expression, it has never been 
examined whether the local chromatin modification is involved in SM22 gene
regulation. In this study, we used the SM22 gene as a model to address whether
transcriptional activation of the gene can be manipulated through adjusting
histone acetylation of the chromatin template and whether SRF- and HAT-containing
coactivators can be recruited onto the SM22 promoter region during gene
activation. Here, we showed that the stimulation of the SM22 promoter by the
coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) was dependent on HAT activity.
Overexpression of HDACs decreased SM22 promoter activity, whereas trichostatin A,
an HDAC inhibitor, stimulated SM22 promoter activity in a CArG box-dependent
manner and induced endogenous SM22 gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
assays showed that trichostatin A treatment in 10T1/2 cells induces chromatin
hyperacetylation in the SM22 gene. Although histone hyperacetylation of the SM22 
gene occurred during SM22 gene expression and SRF and CBP immunocomplexes possess
HAT activities in smooth muscle cells, both SRF and CBP were recruited to the
CArG box-containing region of the promoter. This study provides evidence that
chromatin acetylation is involved in smooth muscle cell-specific gene regulation.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by
craniosynostosis, ptosis, and limb and external ear abnormalities. Variable
expressivity is a well-known phenomenon in this disorder. A large Indian family
has been recently identified as carrying a nonsense TWIST mutation (Q28 X) in 17 
members, of whom 16 were examined in detail. Only 4 (25%) of the patients showed 
patent craniostenosis, namely, oxycephaly. The penetrance of craniosynostosis in 
this family is lower than previously reported in the literature. Fifteen patients
(93%) had moderate to severe ptosis. Minor limb and external ear abnormalities
were present in most patients. Eyelid features were the hallmark of the disease
for 12 members of the family, suggesting that mutations in TWIST may lead to a
phenotype with mainly palpebral features and no craniostenosis. The clinical
analysis of this large family clearly illustrates the significant variable
expressivity, probably related to haploinsufficiency because of the TWIST
mutation. This phenotypic variability remains unclear but could be the result of 
modifier genes and/or genetic background effect, as noticed previously in the
transgenic twist-null heterozygous mice.

Sonic hedgehog signaling plays a critical role in vertebrate patterning, and
signaling defects are associated with severe birth defects and cancer in man.
GLI1 encodes a critical transcription activator in this pathway. GLI1 is
expressed in human basal cell carcinomas and sarcomas. Despite the significance
of the GLI1 gene in human disease, few immediate upstream regulators of GLI1
expression are known. We previously demonstrated that a 5' region, including 5'
flanking sequence, an untranslated exon, and 425 bp of the first intron,
regulates the human GLI1 gene. Here we show that inactivating mutations in E-box,
GC box, AP-2, GATA, GSG, PuF, and Zeste sites identified three critical
regulatory elements, including a GC box that binds Sp1 and two intronic E-boxes
that bind USF proteins or Twist. Expression of Twist but not a frame shift
mutation of Twist activates the wild-type human GLI1 regulatory sequences but not
with inactivating mutations of the E-boxes. Twist activates GLI1 reporter
expression through E-box +482 but requires binding of USF proteins to E-box +157.
Twist mutations cause human birth defects and Twist is overexpressed in many
rhabdomyosarcomas, suggesting that one of Twist's primary roles is the regulation
of GLI1.

Twist haploinsufficiency in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome induces calvarial osteoblast
apoptosis due to increased TNFalpha expression and caspase-2 activation.

Hopital Lariboisiere, 2 rue Ambroise Pare 75475 Paris cedex 10, France.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS) is a human autosomal dominant disorder
characterized by premature fusion of cranial sutures caused by mutations of the
Twist gene encoding a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor. We
previously showed that Twist haploinsufficiency caused by a Y103X nonsense
mutation in SCS alters both proliferation and osteoblast gene expression in human
calvarial osteoblasts, indicating that Twist is an important regulator of
osteoblast differentiation. Here we show that Twist haploinsufficiency alters
osteoblast apoptosis in SCS. Analysis of terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated nick-end labelling (TUNEL) demonstrated increased osteoblast
and osteocyte apoptosis in coronal sutures from two SCS patients with nonsense
mutations (Y103X and Q109X) that result in the synthesis of bHLH-truncated
proteins, and one patient with a missense mutation in the basic domain (R118C)
that abolishes Twist DNA binding. To assess the mechanisms involved, we studied
osteoblast apoptosis in mutant (M-Tw) calvarial cells bearing the Y103X mutation 
resulting in decreased Twist mRNA and protein levels. M-Tw cells cultured in low 
serum conditions showed enhanced DNA fragmentation compared to normal (Nl)
age-matched calvarial cells. Biochemical analysis showed increased activity of
initiator caspases-2 and -8 and downstream effector caspases-3, -6 and -7 in
mutant osteoblasts. Caspase-2 was upstream of caspase-8 and effector caspases-3, 
-6 and -7 because their activities were suppressed by a specific caspase-2
inhibitor. M-Tw osteoblasts also showed increased cytochrome c release from the
mitochondria. However, the activity of the downstream effector caspase-9 was not 
increased due to overexpression of the antagonist protein Hsp70. Detection of
differentially expressed genes using cDNA expression array revealed increased Bax
and TNFalpha mRNA levels in M-Tw compared to Nl cells, a finding confirmed by
RT-PCR and western blot analyses. Neutralization of TNFalpha overexpression using
anti-TNFalpha or anti-TNF receptor 1 antibodies abolished the increased activity 
of caspase-2, caspase-8 and caspases-3, -6 and -7 in M-Tw osteoblasts. These
studies provide novel evidence that Twist haploinsufficiency in SCS promotes
osteoblast apoptosis by a TNFalpha-caspase-2-caspase-8-caspases-3, -6, -7
cascade, and uncover a molecular mechanism in which Twist plays an anti-apoptotic
role in human calvarial osteoblasts.

The objective of this study was to determine if levels of repressors to myogenic 
regulatory factors (MRFs) differ between muscles from young adult and aged
animals. Total RNA from plantaris, gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles of Fischer
344 x Brown Norway rats aged 9 mo (young adult, n = 10) and 37 mo (aged, n = 10) 
was reverse transcribed and then amplified by PCR. To obtain a semiquantitative
measure of the mRNA levels, PCR signals were normalized to cyclophilin or 18S
signals from the corresponding reverse transcription product. Normalization to
cyclophilin and 18S gave similar results. The mRNA levels of MyoD and myogenin
were approximately 275-650% (P < 0.001) and approximately 500-1,100% (P < 0.001) 
greater, respectively, in muscles from aged compared with young adults. In
contrast, the protein levels were lower in plantaris and gastrocnemius muscles
and similar in the soleus muscle of aged vs. young adult rats. Id repressor mRNA 
levels were approximately 300-900% greater in fast and slow muscles of aged
animals (P < or = 0.02), and Mist 1 mRNA was approximately 50% greater in the
plantaris and gastrocnemius muscles (P < 0.01). The mRNA level of Twist mRNA was 
not significantly affected by aging. Id-1, Id-2, and Id-3 protein levels were
approximately 17-740% greater (P < 0.05) in hindlimb muscles of aged rats
compared with young adult rats. The elevated levels of Id mRNA and protein
suggest that MRF repressors may play a role in gene regulation of fast and slow
muscles in aged rats.

Another TWIST on Baller-Gerold syndrome.

Washington, 1959 NE Pacific Street, Seattle, WA 98195-620, USA.

Baller-Gerold syndrome is characterized by craniosynostosis and preaxial upper
limb malformations. Wide heterogeneity exists with regard to the presence of
additional anomalies. Most of the 31 reported cases involve other malformations, 
including cardiac, Central Nervous System (CNS), and urogenital anomalies.
Baller-Gerold syndrome is thought to have autosomal recessive inheritance.
However, Gripp et al. [1999: Am. J. Med. Genet. 82:170-176] recently provided the
first evidence for autosomal dominant inheritance with variable expressivity and 
severity. A nonsense mutation was found in TWIST, a gene associated with
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS). Here we report on a male Caucasian patient of
nonconsanguineous parents, with synostosis of the coronal, metopic, and sagittal 
sutures, and bilateral radial ray hypoplasia. The patient's small, round ears
with prominent crus helices, and cervical anomalies are common features of SCS.
The father had very mild features of SCS. We identify direct paternal
transmission of a novel missense TWIST mutation in the highly conserved Helix II 
domain of this bHLH-family gene. This report lends further support to the recent 
findings by Gripp et al. [1999]. Future TWIST mutational analysis on patients
with craniosynostosis and radial ray involvement will shed light on whether
Baller-Gerold syndrome should be a distinct entity or some cases should be
reclassified as a heterogeneous form of SCS.

A survey of TWIST for mutations in craniosynostosis reveals a variable length
polyglycine tract in asymptomatic individuals.

The human TWIST gene encodes a 202 amino acid transcription factor characterized 
by a highly conserved basic-helix-loop-helix motif in the C-terminal half, and a 
less conserved N-terminal half that has binding activity toward the histone
acetyltransferase p300. Between these domains is a repeat region of unknown
function that encodes the glycine-rich sequence (Gly)5Ala(Gly)5. Heterozygous
mutations of TWIST were previously described in Saethre-Chotzen craniosynostosis 
syndrome [El Ghouzzi et al., 1997; Howard et al., 1997]. During a search for
TWIST mutations in patients with craniosynostosis, we identified, in addition to 
11 novel and one previously described bona fide mutations, several individuals
with rearrangements of the glycine-rich region, involving either deletion of 18
nucleotides or insertion of three, 15, or 21 nucleotides. None of these
rearrangements was consistently associated with clinical disease and we conclude 
that they are at most weakly pathogenic. The glycine stretch may serve as a
flexible linker between the functional domains of the TWIST protein, and as such 
may be subject to reduced evolutionary constraint.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and hyper IgE syndrome in a patient with a novel 11 bp
deletion of the TWIST gene.

Molecular genetic studies in a seven-year-old boy and his mother demonstrated a
novel 11 bp deletion in the TWIST gene (127del11), causing Saethre-Chotzen
syndrome. The mother had rather mild signs of the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome;
however, her son presented with marked acrocephalosyndactyly type 3, leading to
craniotomy at three years. He also had recurrent infections and laboratory
findings comparable with the hyper IgE syndrome, a rare primary immunodeficiency 
disorder. It is likely that the 11bp deletion caused the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome
in the patient and his mother, and another, not yet identified genetic defect,
seen in the patient but not in the mother, is responsible for the hyper IgE
phenotype. A combination of these two congenital conditions has not been
described to date.

Cellular differentiation entails the coordination of cell cycle arrest and
tissue-specific gene expression. We investigated the involvement of basic
helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors in differentiation of osteoblasts using the human
osteoblastic cell line MG63. Serum starvation induced growth arrest at G1 phase, 
accompanied by expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1/Cip1).
Reporter assays with the p21 gene promoter demonstrated that the combination of
E2A (E12 or E47) and coactivator CBP was responsible for p21 induction
independent of p53. Twist inhibited E2A-CBP-dependent activation of the exogenous
and endogenous p21 promoters. Ids similarly inhibited the exogenously transfected
p21 promoter; however less antagonistic effect on the endogenous p21 promoter was
observed. Twist was predominantly present in nuclei in MG63 cells growing in
complete medium, while it localized mainly in the cytoplasm after serum
starvation. The fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3), which generates
signals leading to differentiation of osteoblasts, was found to be controlled by 
the same transcriptional regulation as the p21 gene. E2A and Twist influenced
alkaline phosphatase expression, a consensus marker of osteoblast
differentiation. Expression of E2A and FGFR3 was seen at the location of
osteoblast differentiation in the calvaria of mouse embryos, implicating bHLH
molecules in physiological osteoblast differentiation. These results demonstrate 
that a common regulatory system is involved in at least two distinct steps in
osteoblastic differentiation. Our results also provide the molecular basis of
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, caused by mutations of the TWIST and FGFR3 genes.

We report on a three-month-old boy with a 46,XY,der(Y)t(Y;7)(p11.32;p15.3)
karyotype and growth deficiency, postnatal microcephaly with large fontanels,
wide sagittal and metopic sutures, hypertelorism, choanal stenosis, micrognathia,
bilateral cryptorchidism, hypospadias, abnormal fingers and toes, and severe
developmental delay. FISH studies showed partial trisomy 7p resulting from a de
novo unbalanced translocation. The application of molecular probes from the TWIST
gene region (7p15.3-p21.1) and probes from the pseudoautosomal region (PAR)
demonstrated that the 7p15.3-pter fragment was translocated onto Yp with the
breakpoint within approximately 20 kb from the Yp telomere. We discuss the
possible role of the TWIST gene in abnormal skull development and suggest that
trisomy 7p cases with delayed closure of fontanels can be a result of TWIST gene 
dosage effect.

Recent studies in invertebrates have provided important mechanistic insights into
several general aspects of muscle development. Two new genes have been identified
that are involved in muscle fusion in Drosophila and a novel maternal component
was shown to be responsible for myogenic determination in an ascidian. In
addition, genetic analyses of nematode and Drosophila homologues of factors known
to be myogenic regulators in other species yielded surprising findings about both
the evolutionary conservation and divergence of these functions. Drosophila
myogenesis has become a highly informative model for understanding the interplay 
between the signaling and transcriptional networks that underlie cell-fate
specification during embryonic development.

The Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is characterized by premature fusion of cranial
sutures resulting from mutations in Twist, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
transcription factor. We have identified Twist target genes using human mutant
calvaria osteoblastic cells from a child with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome with a
Twist mutation that introduces a stop codon upstream of the bHLH domain. We
observed that Twist mRNA and protein levels were reduced in mutant cells and that
the Twist mutation increased cell growth in mutant osteoblasts compared with
control cells. The mutation also caused increased alkaline phosphatase and type I
collagen expression independently of cell growth. During in vitro osteogenesis,
Twist mutant cells showed increased ability to form alkaline phosphatase-positive
bone-like nodular structures associated with increased type I collagen
expression. Mutant cells also showed increased collagen synthesis and matrix
production when cultured in aggregates, as well as an increased capacity to form 
a collagenous matrix in vivo when transplanted into nude mice. In contrast, Twist
mutant osteoblasts displayed a cell-autonomous reduction of osteocalcin mRNA
expression in basal conditions and during osteogenesis. The data show that
genetic deletion of Twist causing reduced Twist dosage increases cell growth,
collagen expression, and osteogenic capability, but inhibits osteocalcin gene
expression. This provides one mechanism that may contribute to the premature
cranial ossification induced by deletion of the bHLH Twist domain in
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.

Palatal clefting is often associated with premature fusion of cranial sutures in 
human craniosynostosis syndromes, many of which are characterised by mutations
affecting the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene family. In palatal
fusion, epithelio-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to the dispersion of
the midline epithelial seam. EMT has also been observed in neoplastic epithelial 
cells in relation to the acquisition of malignant characteristics where
morphological changes are accompanied by rapid switching in the expression of
fgfr2 from the epithelial type (kgfr) to the mesenchymal type (bek). The twist
gene codes for a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor putatively involved 
in regulation of transcription of fgfr2. Mutations in the TWIST gene have been
described as being responsible for the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, an autosomal
dominant craniosynostosis associated with cleft palate as well as other
disturbances of the facial skeleton. In this study we have analysed the
distribution of twist transcripts during rat palatogenesis in vivo from 14.5 to
17.5 days post coitum by in situ hybridisation with digoxygenin-labelled ssDNA
probes. twist transcripts were found to be concentrated in mesenchymal cells
beneath the epithelium at the tip of the palatal shelves immediately prior to,
and during fusion as well as in a localised epithelial area at the tip of the
shelves prior to fusion, thereby implicating twist gene expression in the process
of palatogenesis. This pattern of expression illuminates the disturbances of
maxillary growth that occur in human craniosynostotic syndromes.

Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)-induced twist expression is involved in the 
anti-apoptotic effects of the IGF-1 receptor.

Author information:

In this study we investigated the molecular mechanisms whereby insulin-like
growth factor 1 (IGF-1) induced Twist gene expression and the role of Twist in
the anti-apoptotic actions of the IGF-1 receptor. In NIH-3T3 fibroblasts
overexpressing the human IGF-1 receptor (NWTb3), treatment with IGF-1 (10(-8) m) 
for 1 and 4 h increased the level of Twist mRNA as well as protein by 3-fold. In 
contrast, insulin at physiological concentrations did not stimulate Twist
expression in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts overexpressing the human insulin receptor. The 
IGF-1 effect was specific for the IGF-1 receptor since, in cells overexpressing a
dominant negative IGF-1 receptor, IGF-1 failed to increase Twist expression.
Pre-incubation with the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 or expression of a dominant
negative MEK-1 abolished the effect of IGF-1 on Twist mRNA expression in NWTb3
cells, suggesting that Twist induction by IGF-1 occurs via the mitogen-activated 
protein kinase signaling pathway. In vivo, IGF-1 injection increased the mRNA
level of Twist in mouse skeletal muscle, the major site of Twist expression.
Finally, using an antisense strategy, we demonstrated that a reduction of 40% in 
Twist expression decreased significantly the ability of IGF-1 to rescue NWTb3
cells from etoposide-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results define
Twist as an important factor involved in the anti-apoptotic actions of the IGF-1 
receptor.

PURPOSE: To report on the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and
dosage-sensitive Southern blot analysis in the molecular diagnosis of patients
with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.
METHODS: FISH and dosage-sensitive Southern blot analysis utilizing TWIST gene
probes were performed on patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome but without an
identifiable TWIST sequence variation.
RESULTS: Four unrelated patients with a deletion of the TWIST gene were
identified by Southern blot; one of them had a complex chromosomal rearrangement 
involving 7p21 and no apparent deletion by FISH, suggesting a smaller deletion in
the region including the TWIST gene. A fifth patient had an abnormal TWIST gene
fragment on Southern blot analysis that segregated with the disease in the
family; FISH was normal in this patient, suggesting a partial deletion or
rearrangement in or near the gene.
CONCLUSION: FISH and dosage-sensitive Southern blot analysis are useful
diagnostic tools in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome without TWIST sequence variation.

Craniosynostosis and related limb anomalies.

Wilkie AO(1), Oldridge M, Tang Z, Maxson RE Jr.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK.

Many genetically determined craniosynostosis syndromes feature limb anomalies,
implying that pathways of cranial suture and limb morphogenesis share some
identical components. Identification of heterozygous mutations in FGFR1, FGFR2,
FGFR3, TWIST and MSX2 in craniosynostosis has focused particular attention on
these genes. Here we explore two themes: use of clinical/molecular analysis to
provide new clues to pathophysiology and the contrasting effects of loss- and
gain-of-function mutations. Apert syndrome is a severe
craniosynostosis/syndactyly disorder usually caused by specific substitutions
(Ser252Trp or Pro253Arg) in FGFR2. The relative severity of cranial and limb
malformations varies in opposite directions for the two mutations, suggesting
that these phenotypes arise by different mechanisms. Clinical and biochemical
evidence supports a model in which alternative splice forms of FGFR2 mediate
these distinct effects. Pro-->Arg substitutions equivalent the Pro253Arg/FGFR2
mutation occur in both FGFR1 and FGFR3, and are also associated with
craniosynostosis. This suggests a common pathological mechanism, whereby enhanced
affinity for a limited repertoire of tissue-specific ligand(s) excessively
prolongs signalling in the cranial suture. The first MSX2 mutation in
craniosynostosis was described in 1993 but this remains the only example. We have
recently identified three MSX2 mutations associated with a different cranial
phenotype, parietal foramina. DNA binding studies show that the craniosynostosis 
and parietal foramina arise from gain and loss of function, respectively.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is an autosomal dominant skull disorder resulting from
premature fusion of coronal sutures (craniosynostosis). It is caused by mutations
in the TWIST gene encoding a basic Helix-Loop-Helix transcription factor. Here we
report on the identification of a novel mutation affecting a highly conserved
residue of the basic domain. Unlike nonsense and missense mutations lying within 
helices, this mutation does not affect protein stability or heterodimerisation of
TWIST with its partner E12. However, it does abolish TWIST binding capacity to a 
target E-box as efficiently as two missense mutations in the loop-helix II
junction. By contrast, elongation of the loop through a 7 amino acid insertion
appears not to hamper binding to the DNA target. We conclude that loss of TWIST
protein function in Saethre-Chotzen patients can occur at three different levels,
namely protein stability, dimerisation, and DNA binding and that the loop-helix
II junction is essential for effective protein-DNA interaction.

A cohort of 36 unrelated German patients with craniosynostosis syndromes of the
Crouzon and Pfeiffer type were analyzed for FGFR mutations. Mutations in FGFR2
were identified in 25 Crouzon and 5 Pfeiffer syndrome patients, whereas no
sequence alterations were found in the remaining patients, even after screening
of the relevant parts of FGFR1, FGFR3, and TWIST. Mutations in FGFR2 clustered at
two critical cysteine residues, 278 and 342, which were involved in 18 of 30
cases (60%). These two mutational hot spots, therefore, are prime targets for an 
efficient mutation-screening strategy. The spectrum of mutations overlapped the
two syndromes and thus reflected the phenotypic similarities observed in both
patient groups. In 21 families, the origin of the mutation could be traced by
analyzing parents and relatives. Eleven mutations arose de novo, indicating a
high mutation rate for FGFR2. In the 10 familial cases, the clinical presentation
varied considerably within the pedigree, but both syndromes "bred true," i.e., a 
Pfeiffer syndrome phenotype was never observed in a Crouzon syndrome family and
vice versa.

Transcriptional regulation of alpha 2(I) collagen gene expression by fibroblast
growth factor-2 in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells.

Angeles Healthcare System, 11301 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90073, USA.

Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) stimulates proliferation and inhibits
differentiated function of osteoblasts by suppressing synthesis of type I
collagen and other proteins. However, little is known regarding the molecular
mechanisms regulating the suppressive effects of FGF-2 on type I collagen
synthesis in osteoblasts. The zinc finger transcription factor Egr-1 and the
basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of proteins have been implicated in the
regulation of genes crucial to mesodermal cell growth and differentiation. The
aim of this study was to determine whether Egr-1 and TWIST might be potential
transcriptional regulators of the inhibitory effects of FGF-2 on alpha2(I)
collagen expression in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts which undergo a developmental
sequence in vitro. Upon treatment of undifferentiated MC3T3-E1 cells with 1 nM
FGF-2, Egr-1 mRNA increased with the effect maximal after 30-60 min. TWIST mRNA
also increased with the effect maximal at 2 h. We analyzed the transcriptional
control of alpha2(I) collagen gene expression by FGF-2 by transient transfection 
of an alpha2(I) collagen-luciferase construct (pH5) into undifferentiated
MC3T3-E1 cells. The activity of the pH5 luciferase promoter decreased in a
dose-dependent manner following treatment with.01 and 1 nM FGF-2. We identified
putative Egr-1 and TWIST recognition sequences in the proximal region of the
promoter for the murine alpha2(I) collagen gene and a putative Egr-1 site in the 
5' region of the murine TWIST promoter. In gel mobility shift assays, potential
Egr-1 response elements in the 5' region of the murine TWIST and alpha2(I)
collagen genes demonstrated specific Egr-1 binding activity with bFGF-treated
nuclear extracts obtained from MC3T3-E1 cells. These results indicate that Egr-1 
and TWIST are expressed in undifferentiated MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells
following treatment with FGF-2 and they may be potential transcriptional
regulators of FGF-2s negative effects on alpha2(I) collagen gene expression. J.

Human Dermo-1 has attributes similar to twist in early bone development.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Molecular Medicine, Beckman Research Institute of the City of
Hope, Duarte, CA 91010-3011, USA.

Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors are implicated in cell
lineage determination and differentiation. Dermo-1 encodes a bHLH transcription
factor that shares extensive homology with another bHLH transcription factor,
Twist. We have cloned and characterized human Dermo-1 from two different bone
cytoplasmic DNA (cDNA) libraries. Dermo-1 mRNA and protein expression were
examined in human embryo and adult tissue sections. Dermo-1 is expressed in a
subset of mesodermally and ectodermally derived tissues. We further examined
expression of Dermo-1/Twist in human tissues and cell lines. In addition, we
observed Dermo-1 expression in response to basic fibroblast growth factor in
osteoblastic cell lines. To evaluate the functionality of the human Dermo-1
transcription factor in osteoblast metabolism, we made stable osteoblastic cell
lines that over- and underexpress human Dermo-1. These cell lines were analyzed
and compared with previously published data of similar cell lines transfected
with Twist. Our results demonstrate that Dermo-1 caused changes similar to Twist 
in the osteogenic properties of osteoblastic cells, such as morphology, bone
marker gene expression, and biochemical response to cytokines. However, Dermo-1
expression also has unique effects in regulating the mechanism of proliferation, 
on alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity, and in temporal expression patterns. We 
speculate that expression of Twist and Dermo-1 maintains cells in an
osteoprogenitor or preosteoblast-like state, respectively, and prevents premature
or ectopic osteoblast differentiation. Therefore, Twist and Dermo-1 must be
sequentially downregulated in order to initiate the cascade of events responsible
for osteogenic cell differentiation. These results indicate that, during
osteoblast development, Dermo-1 may inhibit osteoblast maturation and maintain
cells in a preosteoblast phenotype by utilizing mechanisms similar but not
identical to those utilized by Twist.

Mutations in the FGFR1-FGFR3 and TWIST genes are known to cause craniosynostosis,
the former by constitutive activation and the latter by haploinsufficiency.
Although clinically achieving the same end result, the premature fusion of the
calvarial bones, it is not known whether these genes lie in the same or
independent pathways during calvarial bone development and later in suture
closure. We have previously shown that Fgfr2c is expressed at the osteogenic
fronts of the developing calvarial bones and that, when FGF is applied via beads 
to the osteogenic fronts, suture closure is accelerated (Kim, H.-J., Rice, D. P. 
C., Kettunen, P. J. and Thesleff, I. (1998) Development 125, 1241-1251). In order
to investigate further the role of FGF signalling during mouse calvarial bone and
suture development, we have performed detailed expression analysis of the
splicing variants of Fgfr1-Fgfr3 and Fgfr4, as well as their potential ligand
Fgf2. The IIIc splice variants of Fgfr1-Fgfr3 as well as the IIIb variant of
Fgfr2 being expressed by differentiating osteoblasts at the osteogenic fronts
(E15). In comparison to Fgf9, Fgf2 showed a more restricted expression pattern
being primarily expressed in the sutural mesenchyme between the osteogenic
fronts. We also carried out a detailed expression analysis of the
helix-loop-helix factors (HLH) Twist and Id1 during calvaria and suture
development (E10-P6). Twist and Id1 were expressed by early preosteoblasts, in
patterns that overlapped those of the FGF ligands, but as these cells
differentiated their expression dramatically decreased. Signalling pathways were 
further studied in vitro, in E15 mouse calvarial explants. Beads soaked in FGF2
induced Twist and inhibited Bsp, a marker of functioning osteoblasts. Meanwhile, 
BMP2 upregulated Id1. Id1 is a dominant negative HLH thought to inhibit basic HLH
such as Twist. In Drosophila, the FGF receptor FR1 is known to be downstream of
Twist. We demonstrated that in Twist(+/)(-) mice, FGFR2 protein expression was
altered. We propose a model of osteoblast differentiation integrating Twist and
FGF in the same pathway, in which FGF acts both at early and late stages.
Disruption of this pathway may lead to craniosynostosis.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a relatively common craniosynostosis disorder with
autosomal dominant inheritance. Mutations in the TWIST gene have been identified 
in patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. The TWIST gene product is a
transcription factor with DNA binding and helix-loop-helix domains. Numerous
missense and nonsense mutations cluster in the functional domains, without any
apparent mutational hot spot. Two novel point mutations and one novel
polymorphism are included in this review. Large deletions including the TWIST
gene have been identified in some patients with learning disabilities or mental
retardation, which are not typically part of the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.
Comprehensive studies in patients with the clinical diagnosis of Saethre-Chotzen 
syndrome have demonstrated a TWIST gene abnormality in about 80%, up to 37% of
which may be large deletions [Johnson et al., 1998]. The gene deletions and
numerous nonsense mutations are suggestive of haploinsufficiency as the
disease-causing mechanism. No genotype phenotype correlation was apparent.

TWIST, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, can regulate the human
osteogenic lineage.

Lee MS(1), Lowe GN, Strong DD, Wergedal JE, Glackin CA.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Molecular Medicine, Beckman Research Institute of the City of
Hope, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.

Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors have been shown to play an
important role in controlling cell type determination and differentiation. TWIST,
a member of the bHLH transcription factor family, is involved in the development 
of mesodermally derived tissue, including the skeleton. We examined the role of
human TWIST in osteoblast metabolism using stable expression of sense and
antisense TWIST in human osteoblast HSaOS-2 cells. Changes in morphology and
osteogenic phenotype characterized these stable clones. Cells that overexpressed 
TWIST exhibited a spindle shaped morphology, reduced levels of alkaline
phosphatase, a reduced proliferation rate, and failed to respond to basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). In contrast, those that underexpressed TWIST
demonstrated a cuboidal epithelial-like morphology characteristic of
differentiated osteoblasts. TWIST antisense cells exhibited increased levels of
alkaline phosphatase and type I collagen mRNA, initiated osteopontin mRNA
expression, and had a reduced proliferation rate. These results indicate that
TWIST overexpressing cells may de-differentiate and remain in an
osteoprogenitor-like state, and antisense TWIST cells progress to a more
differentiated mature osteoblast-like state. Therefore, the level of TWIST can
influence osteogenic gene expression and may act as a master switch in initiating
bone cell differentiation by regulating the osteogenic cell lineage.

Oncogene activation increases susceptibility to apoptosis. Thus, tumorigenesis
must depend, in part, on compensating mutations that protect from programmed cell
death. A functional screen for cDNAs that could counteract the proapoptotic
effects of the myc oncogene identified two related bHLH family members, Twist and
Dermo1. Both of these proteins inhibited oncogene- and p53-dependent cell death. 
Twist expression bypassed p53-induced growth arrest. These effects correlated
with an ability of Twist to interfere with activation of a p53-dependent reporter
and to impair induction of p53 target genes in response to DNA damage. An
underlying explanation for this observation may be provided by the ability of
Twist to reduce expression of the ARF tumor suppressor. Thus, Twist may affect
p53 indirectly through modulation of the ARF/MDM2/p53 pathway. Consistent with a 
role as a potential oncoprotein, Twist expression promoted colony formation of
E1A/ras-transformed mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) in soft agar. Furthermore,
Twist was inappropriately expressed in 50% of rhabdomyosarcomas, a tumor that
arises from skeletal muscle precursors that fail to differentiate. Twist is known
to block myogenic differentiation. Thus, Twist may play multiple roles in the
formation of rhabdomyosarcomas, halting terminal differentiation, inhibiting
apoptosis, and interfering with the p53 tumor-suppressor pathway.

The gene encoding inhibitor of kappa B (IkappaB) kinase alpha (IKKalpha; also
called IKK1) was disrupted by gene targeting. IKKalpha-deficient mice died
perinatally. In IKKalpha-deficient fetuses, limb outgrowth was severely impaired 
despite unaffected skeletal development. The epidermal cells in
IKKalpha-deficient fetuses were highly proliferative with dysregulated epidermal 
differentiation. In the basal layer, degradation of IkappaB and nuclear
localization of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) were not observed. Thus,
IKKalpha is essential for NF-kappaB activation in the limb and skin during
embryogenesis. In contrast, there was no impairment of NF-kappaB activation
induced by either interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha in
IKKalpha-deficient embryonic fibroblasts and thymocytes, indicating that IKKalpha
is not essential for cytokine-induced activation of NF-kappaB.

Mutations within or upstream of the basic helix-loop-helix domain of the TWIST

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (ACS III) is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis
syndrome recently ascribed to mutations in the TWIST gene, a basic
helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) transcription factor regulating head mesenchyme cell
development during cranial neural tube formation in mouse. Studying a series of
22 unrelated ACS III patients, we have found TWIST mutations in 16/22 cases.
Interestingly, these mutations consistently involved the b-HLH domain of the
protein. Indeed, mutant genotypes included frameshift deletions/insertions,
nonsense and missense mutations, either truncating or disrupting the b-HLH motif 
of the protein. This observation gives additional support to the view that most
ACS III cases result from loss-of-function mutations at the TWIST locus. The
P250R recurrent FGFR 3 mutation was found in 2/22 cases presenting mild clinical 
manifestations of the disease but 4/22 cases failed to harbour TWIST or FGFR 3
mutations. Clinical re-examination of patients carrying TWIST mutations failed to
reveal correlations between the mutant genotype and severity of the phenotype.
Finally, since no TWIST mutations were detected in 40 cases of isolated coronal
craniosynostosis, the present study suggests that TWIST mutations are specific to
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.

Significant advances in the study of the human face have revealed the genetic and
gene-environment bases of numerous common and rare craniofacial disorders.
Classification of craniofacial malformations based on clinical phenotypes is
sometimes quite different from the genetic findings of patients. Different
mutations in a single gene can cause distinct syndromes, and mutations in
different genes can cause the same syndrome. The extracellular signaling molecule
SHH, fibroblast growth factor receptors, and transcription factors GLI3, MSX2,
and TWIST are discussed as examples of molecules involved in interrelated signal 
transduction networks regulating craniofacial development. Progress in the
understanding of normal and abnormal craniofacial development, through the study 
of morphoregulatory signaling pathways, has benefited from multifactorial
approaches recommended 40 years ago at the National Institute of Dental
Research-sponsored landmark Gatlinburg Conference. The utilization of
biochemistry, protein structure analyses, tissue culture, and animal model
systems for developmental genetics has resulted in remarkable scientific
advances. The evolutionary conservation of morphoregulatory pathways has revealed
the homology of genes associated with human craniofacial malformations and their 
counterparts that regulate the morphogenesis of fruit flies. The continued
investments in basic, translational, and patient-oriented research regarding
normal and abnormal craniofacial development will translate into substantial
improvements in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of craniofacial diseases
and disorders.

Regulation of histone acetyltransferases p300 and PCAF by the bHLH protein twist

Histone acetyltransferases (HAT) play a critical role in transcriptional control 
by relieving repressive effects of chromatin, and yet how HATs themselves are
regulated remains largely unknown. Here, it is shown that Twist directly binds
two independent HAT domains of acetyltransferases, p300 and p300/CBP-associated
factor (PCAF), and directly regulates their HAT activities. The N terminus of
Twist is a primary domain interacting with both acetyltransferases, and the same 
domain is required for inhibition of p300-dependent transcription by Twist.
Adenovirus E1A protein mimics the effects of Twist by inhibiting the HAT
activities of p300 and PCAF. These findings establish a cogent argument for
considering the HAT domains as a direct target for acetyltransferase regulation
by both a cellular transcription factor and a viral oncoprotein.

Identification of DERMO-1 as a member of helix-loop-helix type transcription
factors expressed in osteoblastic cells.

Tamura M(1), Noda M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Medical Research Institute, Tokyo
Medical and Dental University, Japan.

Several members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) type of transcription
factors have now been reported, and almost every member of this class has been
implicated in transcriptional regulation in cell type determination and
differentiation. Previously, we reported that dominant negative HLH proteins are 
involved in osteoblastic phenotype expression, such as osteocalcin, and hence
differentiation (Tamura and Noda [1994] J. Cell Biol. 126:773-782). In this work,
we used degenerate PCR cloning in order to identify cDNA clones encoding bHLH
proteins expressed in osteoblastic osteosarcoma ROS17/2.8 cells. Sequence
analyses of the 47 clones revealed that 11 clones encoded products with a
characteristic motif of the bHLH transcription factor family. Of these clones,
sequences in the amplified region of seven clones were homologous to the mouse
twist, and three clones were homologous to the mouse twist-related HLH protein,
Dermo-1. To confirm Dermo-1 mRNA expression in osteoblastic cells, we performed
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis using mRNA from
ROS17/2.8 cells and MC3T3-E1 cells by Dermo-1 specific primers and Northern blot 
analysis. These analyses demonstrated that Dermo-1 mRNA was expressed in these
osteoblast-like cell lines. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the partial rat
Dermo-1 cDNA cloned from ROS17/2.8 library revealed that it has the highest
degree of homology with the mouse Dermo-1 cDNA, and the partial amino acid
sequence deduced from the obtained rat Dermo-1 was identical with the
corresponding region of the mouse Dermo-1 amino acid sequence. To further examine
the role of Dermo-1 in the regulation of osteoblastic differentiation, we
examined mRNA levels of Dermo-1 and twist in C3H10T1/2 cells treated with
recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP)-2. Using the RT-PCR method, 
the mRNA levels of Dermo-1 and twist were found to be decreased by the treatment 
with rhBMP-2 in C3H10T1/2 cells. We also observed that the mRNA level of Dermo-1 
was decreased about fourfold by the treatment with rhBMP-2 in C3H10T1/2 cells by 
Northern blot analysis. Moreover, Dermo-1 mRNA was detected at lower levels in
21-day-old differentiated MC3T3-E1 cells compared with 3-day-old undifferentiated
MC3T3-E1 cells. These results suggested that Dermo-1 could be involved in the
osteoblastic differentiation in a negative manner.

Signal-induced ubiquitination of IkappaBalpha by the F-box protein
Slimb/beta-TrCP.

Spencer E(1), Jiang J, Chen ZJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Biology and Oncology, University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75235-9148 USA.

Signal-induced phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha targets this inhibitor of
NF-kappaB for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, thus allowing NF-kappaB 
to enter the nucleus to turn on its target genes. We report here the
identification of an IkappaB-ubiquitin (Ub) ligase complex containing the
F-box/WD40-repeat protein, beta-TrCP, a vertebrate homolog of Drosophila Slimb.
beta-TrCP binds to IkappaBalpha only when the latter is specifically
phosphorylated by an IkappaB kinase complex. Moreover, immunopurified beta-TrCP
ubiquitinates phosphorylated IkappaBalpha at specific lysines in the presence of 
Ub-activating (E1) and -conjugating (Ubch5) enzymes. A beta-TrCP mutant lacking
the F-box inhibits the signal-induced degradation of IkappaBalpha and subsequent 
activation of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription. Furthermore, Drosophila embryos 
deficient in slimb fail to activate twist and snail, two genes known to be
regulated by the NF-kappaB homolog, Dorsal. These biochemical and genetic data
strongly suggest that Slimb/beta-TrCP is the specificity determinant for the
signal-induced ubiquitination of IkappaBalpha.

TWIST gene mutation in a patient with radial aplasia and craniosynostosis:
further evidence for heterogeneity of Baller-Gerold syndrome.

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.

The term Baller-Gerold syndrome was coined by Cohen [1979: Birth Defects 15(5B): 
13-63] to designate the phenotype of craniosynostosis and radial aplasia. It is
thought to be a rare autosomal recessive condition, which, in some patients,
presents with additional abnormalities, such as polymicrogyria, mental
retardation or anal atresia. A phenotypic overlap of Baller-Gerold and Roberts-SC
phocomelia syndrome was noted when a patient with bicoronal synostosis and
bilateral radial hypoplasia was found to have premature centromere separation, a 
finding characteristic of Roberts syndrome [Huson et al.,1990: J Med Genet
27:371-375]. Other cases of presumed Baller-Gerold syndrome were rediagnosed as
Fanconi pancytopenia, Rothmund-Thomson syndrome or VACTERL association. These
reports led to a narrowed redefinition of Baller-Gerold syndrome based on the
exclusion of cytogenetic and hematopoetic abnormalities and the absence of
additional malformations in patients with craniosynostosis and preaxial upper
limb abnormalities. Here we report on a patient with unilateral radial aplasia
and bicoronal synostosis without additional malformations and without chromosome 
breakage, who fits this narrow definition of Baller-Gerold syndrome. We
identified a novel TWIST gene mutation in this patient, a Glu181Stop mutation
predicting a premature termination of the protein carboxy-terminal to the helix 2
domain. This report provides further evidence that Baller-Gerold is of
heterogeneous cause, and a thorough evaluation is indicated to identify a
possibly more specific diagnosis, including Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. This
differential diagnosis is of particular importance, as it is an autosomal
dominant trait. Therefore, the recurrence risk for parents of an affected child
can be 50% if one parent carries the mutation, as opposed to the 25% recurrence
risk for autosomal recessive inheritance. Offspring of the affected patient also 
have a 50% risk to inherit the mutation, while the risk to bear an affected
offspring for an autosomal recessive trait is very low.

Mutations in the coding region of the TWIST gene (encoding a basic
helix-loop-helix transcription factor) have been identified in some cases of
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Haploinsufficiency appears to be the pathogenic
mechanism involved. To investigate the possibility that complete deletions of the
TWIST gene also contribute to this disorder, we have developed a comprehensive
strategy to screen for coding-region mutations and for complete gene deletions.
Heterozygous TWIST mutations were identified in 8 of 10 patients with
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and in 2 of 43 craniosynostosis patients with no clear
diagnosis. In addition to six coding-region mutations, our strategy revealed four
complete TWIST deletions, only one of which associated with a translocation was
suspected on the basis of conventional cytogenetic analysis. This case and two
interstitial deletions were detectable by analysis of polymorphic microsatellite 
loci, including a novel (CA)n locus 7.9 kb away from TWIST, combined with FISH;
these deletions ranged in size from 3.5 Mb to >11.6 Mb. The remaining, much
smaller deletion was detected by Southern blot analysis and removed 2,924 bp,
with a 2-bp orphan sequence at the breakpoint. Significant learning difficulties 
were present in the three patients with megabase-sized deletions, which suggests 
that haploinsufficiency of genes neighboring TWIST contributes to developmental
delay. Our results identify a new microdeletion disorder that maps to chromosome 
band 7p21.1 and that causes a significant proportion of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.

Thirty-two unrelated patients with features of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, a common
autosomal dominant condition of craniosynostosis and limb anomalies, were
screened for mutations in TWIST, FGFR2, and FGFR3. Nine novel and three recurrent
TWIST mutations were found in 12 families. Seven families were found to have the 
FGFR3 P250R mutation, and one individual was found to have an FGFR2 VV269-270
deletion. To date, our detection rate for TWIST or FGFR mutations is 68% in our
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome patients, including our five patients elsewhere reported
with TWIST mutations. More than 35 different TWIST mutations are now known in the
literature. The most common phenotypic features, present in more than a third of 
our patients with TWIST mutations, are coronal synostosis, brachycephaly, low
frontal hairline, facial asymmetry, ptosis, hypertelorism, broad great toes, and 
clinodactyly. Significant intra- and interfamilial phenotypic variability is
present for either TWIST mutations or FGFR mutations. The overlap in clinical
features and the presence, in the same genes, of mutations for more than one
craniosynostotic condition-such as Saethre-Chotzen, Crouzon, and Pfeiffer
syndromes-support the hypothesis that TWIST and FGFRs are components of the same 
molecular pathway involved in the modulation of craniofacial and limb development
in humans.

Most targeted gene mutations are recessive and analyses of gene function often
focus on homozygous mutant phenotypes. Here we describe parts of the expression
pattern of M-twist in the head of developing wild-type mice and present our
analysis of the phenotype of heterozygous twist- null animals at around birth and
in adults. A number of twist -null heterozygous mice present skull and limb
defects and, in addition, we observed other malformations, such as defects in
middle ear formation and the xyphoïd process. Our study is of interest to
understand bone formation and the role of M-twist during this process, as within 
the same animal growth of some bones can be accelerated while for others it can
be delayed. Moreover, we show here that expressivity of the mouse mutant
heterozygous phenotype is dependent on the genetic background. This information
might also be helpful for clinicians, since molecular defects affecting one
allele of the human H-twist ( TWIST ) gene were identified in patients affected
with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS). Expressivity of this syndrome is variable,
although most patients present craniofacial and limb malformations resembling
those seen in mutant mice. Thus the mutant mouse twist -null strain might be a
useful animal model for SCS. The twist -null mutant mouse model, combined with
other mutant mouse strains, might also help in an understanding of the etiology
of morphological abnormalities that appear in human patients affected by other
syndromes.

Drosophila CBP is required for dorsal-dependent twist gene expression.

Akimaru H(1), Hou DX, Ishii S.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Tsukuba Life Science Center, RIKEN, Ibaraki,
Japan.

Although CREB-binding protein (CBP) functions as a co-activator of many
transcription factors, relatively little is known about the physiological role of
CBP. Mutations in the human CBP gene are associated with Rubinstein-Taybi
syndrome, a haplo-insufficiency disorder characterized by abnormal pattern
formation. Recently, we isolated a Drosophila CBP (dCBP) mutant, and found dCBP
to be maternally expressed, suggesting that it plays a role in early
embryogenesis. Mesoderm formation is one of the most important events during
early embryogenesis. To initiate the differentiation of the mesoderm in
Drosophila, multiple zygotic genes such as twist (twi) and snail (sna), which
encode a basic-helix-loop-helix and a zinc finger transcription factor,
respectively, are required. The transcription of these genes is induced by
maternal dorsal (dl) protein (Dl; refs 8-10), a transcription factor that is
homologous to the NF-kappa B family of proteins. The activity of dl is negatively
regulated by cactus (cact), a Drosophila homologue of I kappa B. Here, we show
that dCBP mutants fail to express twi and generate twisted embryos. This is
explained by results showing that dCBP is necessary for dl-mediated activation of
the twi promoter.

The basic domain of myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins is the novel 
target for direct inhibition by another bHLH protein, Twist.

Biology, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90033,

In vertebrates, the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein Twist may be involved
in the negative regulation of cellular determination and in the differentiation
of several lineages, including myogenesis, osteogenesis, and neurogenesis.
Although it has been shown that mouse twist (M-Twist) (i) sequesters E proteins, 
thus preventing formation of myogenic E protein-MyoD complexes and (ii) inhibits 
the MEF2 transcription factor, a cofactor of myogenic bHLH proteins,
overexpression of E proteins and MEF2 failed to rescue the inhibitory effects of 
M-Twist on MyoD. We report here that M-Twist physically interacts with the
myogenic bHLH proteins in vitro and in vivo and that this interaction is required
for the inhibition of MyoD by M-Twist. In contrast to the conventional HLH-HLH
domain interaction formed in the MyoD/E12 heterodimer, this novel type of
interaction uses the basic domains of the two proteins. While the MyoD HLH domain
without the basic domain failed to interact with M-Twist, a MyoD peptide
containing only the basic and helix 1 regions was sufficient to interact with
M-Twist, suggesting that the basic domain contacts M-Twist. The replacement of
three arginine residues by alanines in the M-Twist basic domain was sufficient to
abolish both the binding and inhibition of MyoD by M-Twist, while the domain
retained other M-Twist functions such as heterodimerization with an E protein and
inhibition of MEF2 transactivation. These findings demonstrate that M-Twist
interacts with MyoD through the basic domains, thereby inhibiting MyoD.

Twist protein in mouse embryogenesis.

Gitelman I(1).

Author information: 
(1)Cancer Research Center, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, 84105,
Israel.

The genes in the twist family of bHLH transcription factors are essential for
embryogenesis of both vertebrates and invertebrates, as demonstrated by the
embryonic lethal phenotypes of the Drosophila and mouse twist-null mutants.
Presented here is the embryonic distribution of murine Twist protein (MTwist).
Its appearance and presence in the course of early embryogenesis was followed
with a monoclonal antibody, alphaTwiMab-1, the first antibody generated against
any of the vertebrate Twist proteins. The specificity for MTwist was demonstrated
in comparative Western blot experiments, reticulocyte lysate assays, and
immunohistochemistry of embryonic mouse samples. Consistent with its probable
role as a transcription factor, MTwist localized to the nuclei. MTwist signal
first appeared in 8- to 10-somite embryos at 8.25 dpc in the cranial neural crest
cells and branchial arches, in the limb-bud mesenchyme and the somatic lateral
plate, and in the sclerotome and the dermatome of the somites. The presence of
MTwist protein in these tissues corroborates the reported MTwist RNA distribution
and the phenotype of the MTwist-null mutants. There also emerged, however, an
unexpected difference between MTwist RNA and protein expression. No protein could
be detected prior to 8.25 dpc, despite the reported high levels of transcripts as
early as 7.0 dpc. Also, the presomitic mesoderm, epithelial somites, and anterior
mesoderm expressed abundant MTwist RNA, but no protein. The results suggest
posttranscriptional downregulation of MTwist in these regions. A proposed role of
MTwist in somite formation and maturation is inhibition of myogenic bHLH and MEF2
genes and thus prevention of premature and/or ectopic differentiation in the
presomitic mesoderm and epithelial somites. The absence of MTwist protein from
these areas indicates that its role in somitogenesis must be reevaluated.

Saethre-Chotzen form of craniosynostosis. The position of the Saethre-Chotzen
gene has previously been refined by FISH analysis of four patients carrying
balanced translocations involving 7p21 which suggested that it was located
between D7S488 and D7S503. We report here that the breakpoints in four
translocation patients do not interrupt the coding sequence of the TWIST gene and
thus most likely act through a positional effect. Twelve Saethre-Chotzen cases
were found to have TWIST mutations. Four of these families had been used as part 
of the linkage study of the Saethre-Chotzen locus. The mutations detected
included missense and nonsense mutations and three cases of a 21 bp duplication. 
Although phenotypically diagnosed as having Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, three
families were found to have a pro250arg mutation of FGFR3.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, a common autosomal dominant craniosynostosis in humans,
is characterized by brachydactyly, soft tissue syndactyly and facial dysmorphism 
including ptosis, facial asymmetry, and prominent ear crura. Previously, we
identified a yeast artificial chromosome that encompassed the breakpoint of an
apparently balanced t(6;7) (q16.2;p15.3) translocation associated with a mild
form of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. We now describe, at the DNA sequence level, the
region on chromosome 7 affected by this translocation event. The rearrangement
occurred approximately 5 kb 3' of the human TWIST locus and deleted 518 bp of
chromosome 7. The TWIST gene codes for a transcription factor containing a basic 
helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) motif and has recently been described as a candidate
gene for Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, based on the detection of mutations within the
coding region. Potential exon sequences flanking the chromosome 7 translocation
breakpoint did not hit known genes in database searches. The chromosome
rearrangement downstream of TWIST is compatible with the notion that this is a
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome gene and implies loss of function of one allele by a
positional effect as a possible mechanism of mutation to evoke the syndrome.

A direct contact between the dorsal rel homology domain and Twist may mediate
transcriptional synergy.

Shirokawa JM(1), Courey AJ.

(1)Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Los
Angeles 90095-1569, USA.

The establishment of mesoderm and neuroectoderm in the early Drosophila embryo
relies on interactions between the Dorsal morphogen and basic-helix-loop-helix
(bHLH) activators. Here we show that Dorsal and the bHLH activator Twist
synergistically activate transcription in cell culture and in vitro from a
promoter containing binding sites for both factors. Somewhat surprisingly, a
region of Twist outside the conserved bHLH domain is required for the synergy. In
Dorsal, the rel homology domain appears to be sufficient for synergy.
Protein-protein interaction assays show that Twist and Dorsal bind to one another
in vitro. However, this interaction does not appear to be of sufficient strength 
to yield cooperative binding to DNA. Nonetheless, the regions of Twist and Dorsal
required for the binding interaction are also required for synergistic
transcriptional activation.

We have previously reported on the isolation of several differentially expressed 
genes derived from young and senescent non growing WI-38 human fetal lung-derived
fibroblasts. A 0.8-kb cDNA clone, isolate EPC-A2 (early population doubling
cDNA-A2), encodes the 3' end of the human homolog of the Twist protein. Twist
genes encode basic helix-loop-helix DNA-binding transcription factors that play
crucial roles in mesoderm development. Here, we report the cloning and sequencing
of the genomic human twist gene. It encodes a protein of 201 amino acids with 96%
amino acid sequence identity to mouse Twist, and 100% sequence conservation in
the DNA-binding region among all species in which it has been characterized. We
further show that expression of human twist is retained in mesodermally-derived
tissues and cell lines derived from adult donors.

Enlargement of the skull vault occurs by appositional growth at the fibrous
joints between the bones, termed cranial sutures. Relatively little is known
about the developmental biology of this process, but genetically determined
disorders of premature cranial suture fusion (craniosynostosis) provide one route
to the identification of some of the key molecules involved. Mutations of the
MSX2, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and TWIST genes yield new insights, both into normal
and abnormal cranial suture biogenesis and into problems of broad interest, such 
as the conservation of molecular pathways in development, and mechanisms of
mutation and dominance.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (acrocephalo-syndactyly type III, ACS III) is an
autosomal dominant craniosynostosis with brachydactyly, soft tissue syndactyly
and facial dysmorphism including ptosis, facial asymmetry and prominent ear
crura. ACS III has been mapped to chromosome 7p21-22. Of interest, TWIST, the
human counterpart of the murine Twist gene, has been localized on chromosome 7p21
as well. The Twist gene product is a transcription factor containing a basic
helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) domain, required in head mesenchyme for cranial neural
tube morphogenesis in mice. The co-localisation of ACS III and TWIST prompted us 
to screen ACS III patients for TWIST gene mutations especially as mice
heterozygous for Twist null mutations displayed skull defects and duplication of 
hind leg digits. Here, we report 21-bp insertions and nonsense mutations of the
TWIST gene (S127X, E130X) in seven ACS III probands and describe impairment of
head mesenchyme induction by TWIST as a novel pathophysiological mechanism in
human craniosynostoses.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is one of the most common autosomal dominant disorders
of craniosynostosis in humans and is characterized by craniofacial and limb
anomalies. The locus for Saethre-Chotzen syndrome maps to chromosome 7p21-p22. We
have evaluated TWIST, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, as a
candidate gene for this condition because its expression pattern and mutant
phenotypes in Drosophila and mouse are consistent with the Saethre-Chotzen
phenotype. We mapped TWIST to human chromosome 7p21-p22 and mutational analysis
reveals nonsense, missense, insertion and deletion mutations in patients. These
mutations occur within the basic DNA binding, helix I and loop domains, or result
in premature termination of the protein. Studies in Drosophila indicate that
twist may affect the transcription of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs),
another gene family implicated in human craniosynostosis. The emerging cascade of
molecular components involved in craniofacial and limb development now includes
TWIST, which may function as an upstream regulator of FGFRs.

Altered expression of the twist gene in young versus senescent human diploid
fibroblasts.

(1)Center for Gerontological Research, The Medical College of Pennsylvania and
Hahnemann University, Philadelphia 19129, USA.

We have recently reported the cloning and characterization of the human twist
gene (H-twist), which encodes an evolutionarily conserved helix-loop-helix
transcription factor. In several species, twist has been shown to play a role in 
mesoderm differentiation. We now report on the differential expression of H-twist
as a function of in vitro life span in human diploid fibroblasts. H-twist was
found to be expressed at a relatively high level in quiescent young cells.
Addition of fresh serum to young G0 cultures results in a rapid repression of
H-twist mRNA expression. This repression depends on the presence of growth
factors, specifically EGF, and requires protein synthesis. mRNA stability studies
using either actinomycin D or alpha-amanitin indicate a similar decay rate of
H-twist mRNA in both young and senescent cells, suggesting that the differential 
expression of H-twist in young versus old is not primarily regulated at the level
of mRNA turnover.

Transcription factor AP-2 essential for cranial closure and craniofacial
development.

Author information: 
(1)Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142,
USA.

During closure of the neural tube in the mouse, transcription factor AP-2 is
expressed in ectoderm and in neural-crest cells migrating from the cranial neural
folds. Cranial neural crest cells provide patterning information for craniofacial
morphogenesis, generate most of the skull bones, and together with placodal
ectoderm, form the cranial ganglia. To study the role of AP-2 during
embryogenesis, we undertook a targeted mutagenesis of the AP-2 gene in the mouse.
Here we report that AP-2(-/-) mice died perinatally with cranio-abdominoschisis
and severe dismorphogenesis of the face, skull, sensory organs and cranial
ganglia. Failure of cranial closure between 9 and 9.5 days postcoitum coincided
with increased apoptosis in the midbrain, anterior hindbrain and proximal
mesenchyme of the first branchial arch, but did not involve loss of expression of
twist or Pax-3, two other regulatory genes known to be required for cranial
closure.

Endochondral and intramembranous fetal bone development: osteoblastic cell
proliferation, and expression of alkaline phosphatase, m-twist, and histone H4.

Alborzi A(1), Mac K, Glackin CA, Murray SS, Zernik JH.

We have previously studied the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and
alpha2(I) collagen (two phenotypic markers of osteoblastic cell differentiation) 
during development of the rat mandible, and the spatial and temporal distribution
of the respective transcripts. Our current studies utilize the rat mandible and
hind foot as in vivo model systems to investigate the relationship between
osteoblastic differentiation and proliferation during intramembranous and
endochondral bone formation. Pregnant rats, at 15.17, and 19 days of gestation
were intraperitoneally injected with various doses of [3H]-thymidine, and
sacrificed at various time intervals in order to label dividing embryonic
osteoblastic and preosteoblastic cells. Cross sections through the mid-body of
15-day embryos showed [3H-thymidine dose-dependent labeling of a relatively high 
percentage of cells in the liver (49 +/- 8% at 440 muCi) and a lower percentage
of cells of the developing vertebral cartilage (29 +/- 6% at 440 muCi).
ALP-positive condensed mesenchyme--consisting of mandibular preosteoblast (15
days of gestation) showed a relatively high (32 +/- 5%) level of [3H]-thymidine
labeling, compared to surrounding ALP-negative loose mesenchymal cells (22 +/-
1%). Similar results were observed in the developing hind foot of 19-day embryos 
for ALP-positive cells (15 +/- 6%) and surrounding ALP-negative cells (13 +/-
5%). In both the hind foot and the mandible an overall decrease in labeling was
observed during bone development. RNA samples from these tissues show increasing 
amounts of ALP mRNA, and decreasing amounts of histone H4 mRNA between days 15
and 19 of gestation. These data indicate that a general inverse correlation
between osteoblastic differentiation and proliferation, similar to the
correlation previously described in cultured osteogenic cells, is also present in
developing bones in vivo. However, these results indicate that ALP-positive
preosteoblasts, committed to the osteoblastic lineage, maintain their
proliferative capacity. In an attempt to elucidate underlying molecular
mechanisms, we further investigated the levels of expression of m-twist in these 
tissues. This member of the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription
regulators has been previously implied as playing a role in osteoblast
differentiation in culture. Our results demonstrate a decrease in m-twist levels 
during bone development in both the mandible and the hind foot.

Expression of M-twist during postimplantation development of the mouse.

Füchtbauer EM(1).

Author information: 
(1)Max-Planck-Institut für Immunbiologie, Freiburg, Germany.

The murine homologue of the Drosophila twist gene has been shown to be essential 
for head mesenchyme formation and to act as an inhibitor of muscle
differentiation. This paper presents a detailed analysis of M-twist expression
patterns from day 7 post coitum (p.c.) to day 18 p.c., indicating a more general 
function of the M-twist gene. At day 7 p.c., M-twist is expressed in the mesoderm
outside the primitive streak. Later M-twist message is predominantly found in the
somites, the head mesenchyme, the branchial arches, the limbs, and in the
mesenchyme underneath the epidermis. Beginning at day 8 p.c., M-twist is mainly
expressed in undifferentiated cells committed to muscle and cartilage
development: this expression is consistent with a suggested role of M-twist in
inhibiting overt muscle and cartilage differentiation. However, during
organogenesis, M-twist is expressed in several areas of mesenchyme-epithelia
interactions, suggesting additional tissue specific functions.

M-twist expression inhibits mouse embryonic stem cell-derived myogenic
differentiation in vitro.

(1)Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research, Gatersleben, Federal
Republic of Germany.

The mouse M-twist gene codes for a basic helix-loop-helix protein which was shown
to be inhibitory for differentiation of myogenic cells in culture. Mouse
embryonic stem (ES) cells of line BLC6 efficiently differentiating into skeletal 
muscle cells when cultivated as embryo-like aggregates (embryoid bodies) were
stably transfected with the plasmid pME18s-twist containing the M-twist gene
under the control of the modified SV40 early promoter SR alpha. Two
pME18s-twist-expressing clones showed delayed and reduced skeletal muscle cell
differentiation depending on the level of exogenous M-twist expression compared
to control cells. By morphological analysis using phase contrast microscopy and
hematoxylin-eosin staining, the development of first myocytes and formation of
myotubes in embryoid body outgrowths of these clones were found to be delayed for
about 3 days in comparison to control cells. Immunofluorescence studies with a
monoclonal antibody against sarcomeric myosin heavy chain revealed that myogenic 
cells appeared in so-called myogenic centers showing a reduced number of myocytes
and myotubes in the M-twist-expressing clones. Using RT-PCR analysis the
expression of the skeletal muscle determination genes myf5, myogenin, and MyoD as
well as muscle-specific genes coding for the gamma-subunit of the nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor and the cell adhesion molecule M-cadherin were found to
appear with a delay of at least 1 to 4 days in the pME18s-twist-transfected cells
during the development of embryoid bodies. We conclude that the constitutive
expression of the mouse M-twist gene during ES-cell-derived differentiation has
an inhibitory effect on skeletal muscle cell development depending on the level
of exogenous M-twist expression.

Dorso-ventral and rostro-caudal sequential expression of M-twist in the
postimplantation murine embryo.

Author information: 
(1)LGME du CNRS, U-184 de l'INSERM, Faculté de Médecine, Strasbourg, France.

M-twist is the murine homolog of the Drosophila twist gene which is a zygotic
target for maternal genes that establish embryonic dorso-ventral polarity and is 
necessary for mesoderm formation. We recently showed that before gastrulation,
M-twist transcripts are detected in morulae and blastocysts, then in
extra-embryonic tissues of early implanted mouse embryos before the onset of
gastrulation, and we suggested that M-twist might be involved in embryonic
polarity (Stoetzel et al., submitted). Here, using in situ hybridization on whole
mount embryos, we present the expression pattern of M-twist from primitive streak
stage up to 10.5 days p.c. In implanted embryos, M-twist is first expressed in
extra-embryonic tissues, then in embryo proper around egg cylinder stage within
some embryonic ectodermal cells of the primitive streak. Slightly later,
scattered cells within the amniotic cavity apparently detached from the primitive
streak also express the gene. Then, M-twist transcripts accumulate in head
mesenchyme, the first aortic arches, somites and lateral mesoderm and, as
development proceeds, successively the second, third and fourth branchial arches,
the anterior limb buds and, finally, the posterior limb buds. Thus M-twist
expression in implanted embryos occurs first along a dorso-ventral gradient
pattern until the headfold stage, then it is gradually observed along the
rostro-caudal axis of the embryos as development procedes in the mesodermal cell 
layer and in neural crest cell derivatives. In addition, we show the existence of
some previously undescribed subsets of scattered cells that express M-twist and
thus might participate in murine embryo development.

twist is required in head mesenchyme for cranial neural tube morphogenesis.

Chen ZF(1), Behringer RR.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center, Houston 77030, USA.

To understand the role of twist during mammalian development, we generated
twist-null mice. twist-null embryos died at embryonic day 11.5. Their most
prominent phenotype was a failure of the cranial neural folds to fuse. Mutant
embryos also had defects in head mesenchyme, somites, and limb buds. Chimera
analysis suggested that head mesenchyme was required for cranial neural tube
closure and that twist acted in a cell-autonomous manner in this tissue. In
addition, in the head mesenchyme region of chimeras, twist-null cells were
segregated from wild-type cells, and in the forebrain they lacked mesenchymal
characteristics. These results suggest that twist regulates the cellular
phenotype and behavior of head mesenchyme cells that are essential for the
subsequent formation of the cranial neural tube.

M-twist is an inhibitor of muscle differentiation.

Hebrok M(1), Wertz K, Füchtbauer EM.

Author information: 
(1)Max-Planck-Institut für Immunbiologie, Freiburg, Germany.

The twist gene encodes a transcription factor containing a conserved basic
helix-loop-helix domain. During development, transcription factors of this type
are normally associated with the induction of differentiation. Yet the expression
pattern of the murine M-twist suggests an inhibitory role during muscle
differentiation. Following stable transfection of myogenic mouse cells with an
M-twist expression vector, 75% of M-twist-expressing clones were impaired in
their ability to differentiate. In contrast, only 15% of control clones were
unable to differentiate. Treatment with antisense oligonucleotides restored
differentiation capacity in a concentration-dependent manner. Control
oligonucleotides had no effect. These experiments show that the mouse twist gene 
can act as an inhibitor of muscle differentiation and that this inhibition is
reversible.

The twist gene was characterized in Drosophila as being necessary at gastrulation
for the establishment of the mesodermal germ layer. It codes for a nuclear
DNA-binding protein that is probably a transcription factor. We have cloned and
sequenced the M-twist gene of Mus musculus. The deduced proteins encoded by the
Mus, Xenopus, and Drosophila twist cDNAs, respectively, show a high degree of
similarity. Northern blot analyses and in situ hybridizations reveal that the
1.7-kb murine M-twist m-RNA is present at early stages, starting at 8 days post
coitum, and is expressed the most at 9.5 days in the cephalic and branchial
mesectoderm, in some derivatives of the mesodermal layer (sclerotoma and
somatopleura), and in the limb buds.
