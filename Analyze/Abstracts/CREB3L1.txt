Endometriosis is a major cause of infertility and pelvic pain, affecting more
than 10% of reproductive-aged women. Progesterone resistance has been observed in
the endometrium of women with this disease, as evidenced by alterations in
progesterone-responsive gene and protein expression. cAMPResponse Element-Binding
3-like protein 1 (Creb3l1) has previously been identified as a progesterone
receptor (PR) target gene in mouse uterus via high density DNA microarray
analysis. However, CREB3L1 function has not been studied in the context of
endometriosis and uterine biology. In this study, we validated progesterone (P4) 
regulation of Creb3l1 in the uteri of wild-type and progesterone receptor
knockout (PRKO) mice. Furthermore, we observed that CREB3L1 expression was
significantly higher in secretory phase human endometrium compared to
proliferative phase and that CREB3L1 expression was significantly decreased in
the endometrium of women with endometriosis. Lastly, by transfecting CREB3L1
siRNA into cultured human endometrial stromal cells (hESCs) prior to hormonal
induction of in vitro decidualization, we showed that CREB3L1 is required for the
decidualization process. Interestingly, phosphorylation of ERK1/2, critical
factor for decidualization, was also significantly reduced in CREB3L1-silenced
hESCs. It is known that hESCs from patients with endometriosis show impaired
decidualization and that dysregulation of the P4-PR signaling axis is linked to a
variety of endometrial diseases including infertility and endometriosis.
Therefore, these results suggest that CREB3L1 is required for decidualization in 
mice and humans and may be linked to the pathogenesis of endometriosis in a
P4-dependent manner.

BACKGROUND: CREB3L1 (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 3-like protein 1), a
member of the unfolded protein response, has recently been identified as a
metastasis suppressor in both breast and bladder cancer.
METHODS: Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) and immunoblotting were used to
determine the impact of histone deacetylation and DNA methylation inhibitors on
CREB3L1 expression in breast cancer cell lines. Breast cancer cell lines and
tumor samples were analyzed similarly, and CREB3L1 gene methylation was
determined using sodium bisulfite conversion and DNA sequencing.
Immunohistochemistry was used to determine nuclear versus cytoplasmic CREB3L1
protein. Large breast cancer database analyses were carried out to examine
relationships between CREB3L1 gene methylation and mRNA expression in addition to
CREB3L1 mRNA expression and prognosis.
RESULTS: This study demonstrates that the low CREB3L1 expression previously seen 
in highly metastatic breast cancer cell lines is caused in part by epigenetic
silencing. Treatment of several highly metastatic breast cancer cell lines that
had low CREB3L1 expression with DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase
inhibitors induced expression of CREB3L1, both mRNA and protein. In human breast 
tumors, CREB3L1 mRNA expression was upregulated in low and medium-grade tumors,
most frequently of the luminal and HER2 amplified subtypes. In contrast, CREB3L1 
expression was repressed in high-grade tumors, and its loss was most frequently
associated with triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs). Importantly,
bioinformatics analyses of tumor databases support these findings, with
methylation of the CREB3L1 gene associated with TNBCs, and strongly negatively
correlated with CREB3L1 mRNA expression. Decreased CREB3L1 mRNA expression was
associated with increased tumor grade and reduced progression-free survival. An
immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that low-grade breast tumors frequently
had nuclear CREB3L1 protein, in contrast to the high-grade breast tumors in which
CREB3L1 was cytoplasmic, suggesting that differential localization may also
regulate CREB3L1 effectiveness in metastasis suppression.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data further strengthens the role for CREB3L1 as a metastasis
suppressor in breast cancer and demonstrates that epigenetic silencing is a major
regulator of the loss of CREB3L1 expression. We also highlight that CREB3L1
expression is frequently altered in many cancer types suggesting that it could
have a broader role in cancer progression and metastasis.

OASIS/CREB3L1, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transcription factor, plays
important roles in osteoblast differentiation. In this study, we identified new
crosstalk between OASIS and the hypoxia signaling pathway, which regulates
vascularization during bone development. RT-PCR and real-time PCR analyses
revealed significant decreases in the expression levels of hypoxia-inducible
factor-1a (HIF-1a) target genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor A
(VEGFA) in OASIS-deficient (Oasis(-/-)) mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In
coimmunoprecipitation experiments, the N-terminal fragment of OASIS (OASIS-N;
activated form of OASIS) bound to HIF-1a through the bZIP domain. Luciferase
assays showed that OASIS-N promoted the transcription activities of a reporter
gene via a hypoxia-response element (HRE). Furthermore, the expression levels of 
an angiogenic factor Vegfa was decreased in Oasis(-/-) osteoblasts.
Immunostaining and metatarsal angiogenesis assay showed retarded vascularization 
in bone tissue of Oasis(-/-) mice. These results suggest that OASIS affects the
expression of HIF-1a target genes through the protein interaction with HIF-1a,
and that OASIS-HIF-1a complexes may play essential roles in angiogenesis during
bone development.

BACKGROUND: Arginine vasopressin (AVP), a neuropeptide hormone that functions in 
the regulation of water homeostasis by controlling water re-absorption at
kidneys, is synthesised in supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus of the 
hypothalamus. An increase in plasma osmolality stimulates secretion of AVP to
blood circulation and induces AVP synthesis in these nuclei. Although studies on 
mechanism of AVP transcriptional regulation in hypothalamus proposed that cAMP
and glucocorticoids positively and negatively regulate Avp expression,
respectively, the molecular mechanisms have remained elusive. Recently, we
identified CREB3L1 (cAMP-responsive element binding protein 3 like 1) as a
putative transcription factor of Avp transcription in the rat hypothalamus.
However the mechanism of how CREB3L1 is regulated in response of hyperosmotic
stress in the neurons of hypothalamus has never been reported. This study aims to
investigate effect of previously reported regulators (cAMP and glucocorticoid) of
Avp transcription on transcription factor CREB3L1 in order to establish a
molecular explanation for cAMP and glucocorticoids effect on AVP expression.
RESULTS: The effect of cAMP and glucocorticoid treatment on Creb3l1 was
investigated in both AtT20 cells and hypothalamic organotypic cultures. The
expression of Creb3l1 was increased in both mRNA and protein level by treatment
with forskolin, which raises intracellular cAMP levels. Activation of cAMP by
forskolin also increased Avp promoter activity in AtT20 cells and this effect was
blunted by shRNA mediated silencing of Creb3l1. The forskolin induced increase in
Creb3l1 expression was diminished by combined treatment with dexamethasone, and, 
in vivo, intraperitoneal dexamethasone injection blunted the increase in Creb3l1 
and Avp expression induced by hyperosmotic stress.
CONCLUSION: Here we shows that cAMP and glucocorticoid positively and negatively 
regulate Creb3l1 expression in the rat hypothalamus, respectively, and regulation
of cAMP on AVP expression is mediated through CREB3L1. This data provides the
connection between CREB3L1, a newly identified transcription factor of AVP
expression, with the previously proposed mechanism of Avp transcription which
extends our understanding in transcription regulation of Avp in the hypothalamus.

The authors present two cases of primary sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma
(SEF) of the kidney. Both patients had a mass in the upper part of the left
kidney without any primary extrarenal neoplastic lesions. Grossly, the tumors
were solid masses both measuring 7.5 cm in the greatest diameter. Histologically,
one of the lesions exhibited a predominantly lobular growth of round or oval
small uniform epithelioid cells in variable cellularity. Circular zones of
crowded tumor cells alternating with hypocellular collagenous tissue in a
concentric fashion around entrapped native renal tubules were distinctive. The
second case was distinctive with significant cytological atypia in the neoplastic
cells and prominent reactive proliferations in the trapped renal tubules.
Immunohistochemically, vimentin, bcl-2 and MUC4 were diffusely positive in both. 
They were negative for S-100 protein, CD34, and desmin, whereas CD99 were
positive in one lesion. Fluorescence in situ hybridization assay using dual
staining probes detected EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion in each lesion, which is
characteristic molecular findings of SEF. One patient presented widespread
distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. In the other, no tumor deposits were
detected other than primary. Both patients have been alive with 30 and 10 month
follow-ups, respectively. These tumors are 6th and 7th cases of primary renal SEF
in the literature confirmed by FISH study, which exhibit unique and remarkable
histomorphologic features.

BACKGROUND: Doxorubicin has been shown to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells
through proteolytic activation of CREB3L1 (cAMP response element binding protein 
3-like 1), a transcription factor synthesized as a membrane-bound precursor. Upon
doxorubicin treatment, CREB3L1 is cleaved so that the N-terminal domain of the
protein can reach the nucleus where it activates transcription of genes that
inhibit cell proliferation. These results suggest that the level of CREB3L1 in
cancer cells may determine their sensitivity to doxorubicin.
METHODS: Mice transplanted with 6 lines of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were
injected with doxorubicin to observe the effect of the chemotherapy on tumor
growth. Immunohistochemistry and bioinformatics analyses were performed to
compare CREB3L1 levels in types of cancer known to respond to doxorubicin versus 
those resistant to doxorubicin.
RESULTS: Higher levels of CREB3L1 protein are correlated with increased
doxorubicin sensitivity of xenograft RCC tumors (p = 0.017 by Pearson analysis). 
From patient tumor biopsies we analyzed, CREB3L1 was expressed in 19% of RCC,
which is generally resistant to doxorubicin, but in 70% of diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma that is sensitive to doxorubicin. Doxorubicin is used as the standard
treatment for cancers that express the highest levels of CREB3L1 such as
osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma but is not generally used to
treat those that express the lowest levels of CREB3L1 such as RCC.
CONCLUSION: Identification of CREB3L1 as the biomarker for doxorubicin
sensitivity may markedly improve the doxorubicin response rate by applying
doxorubicin only to patients with cancers expressing CREB3L1.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is a rare fibrosarcoma variant with
specific histomorphology and consistent translocation (EWSR1-CREB3L1/2). To date,
110 cases have been reported; only 15 originated within the abdomen. With only 2 
cases reported parallel to our study and one case briefly mentioned in a previous
series, primary renal SEF is exceptionally rare but might be underrecognized. We 
herein describe 2 cases affecting a 23-year-old woman and a 43-year-old man.
Tumor size was 22 and 4.2 cm, respectively. Patient 1 developed skeletal and
multiple pulmonary metastases. She died of disease 82 months later, despite
aggressive multimodality therapy. Patient 2 has no evidence of recurrence or
metastasis (8 months after surgery). Histologic examination showed similar
appearance with monotonous bland medium-sized epithelioid cells with rounded
slightly vesicular nuclei and clear cytoplasm imparting a carcinoma-like
appearance set within a highly sclerotic hyaline fibrous stroma. The tumor cells 
were arranged in nests, single cell cords, trabeculae, or solid sheets with
frequent entrapment of renal tubules and glomeruli. Immunohistochemistry showed
strong expression of vimentin, bcl2, CD99, and MUC4, whereas cytokeratin and
other markers were negative. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed a
translocation involving the EWSR1 gene locus in case 2. Molecular analysis in
case 1 was not successful due to poor signal quality. To our knowledge, this is
the second report documenting primary renal SEF. Awareness of this entity would
help avoid misinterpretation as clear cell carcinoma, sclerosing perivascular
epithelioid cell tumor, Xp.11 translocation carcinoma, and other more frequent
neoplasms at this site.

Transcription Factor CREB3L1 Regulates Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response
Genes in the Osmotically Challenged Rat Hypothalamus.

Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is synthesised in magnocellular neurons (MCNs) of
supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus.
In response to the hyperosmotic stressors of dehydration (complete fluid
deprivation, DH) or salt loading (drinking 2% salt solution, SL), AVP synthesis
increases in MCNs, which over-burdens the protein folding machinery in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) are
signaling pathways that improve ER function in response to the accumulation of
misfold/unfold protein. We asked whether an ER stress response was activated in
the SON and PVN of DH and SL rats. We observed increased mRNA expression for the 
immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP), activating transcription factor
4 (Atf4), C/EBP-homologous protein (Chop), and cAMP responsive element binding
protein 3 like 1 (Creb3l1) in both SON and PVN of DH and SL rats. Although we
found no changes in the splicing pattern of X box-binding protein 1 (Xbp1), an
increase in the level of the unspliced form of Xbp1 (Xbp1U) was observed in DH
and SL rats. CREB3L1, a novel ER stress inducer, has been shown to be activated
by ER stress to regulate the expression of target genes. We have previously shown
that CREB3L1 is a transcriptional regulator of the AVP gene; however, a role for 
CREB3L1 in the response to ER stress has yet to be investigated in MCNs. Here, we
used lentiviral vectors to introduce a dominant negative form of CREB3L1
(CREB3L1DN) in the rat SON. Expression of CREB3L1DN in the SON decreased Chop and
Xbp1U mRNA levels, but not BiP and Atf4 transcript expression. CREB3L1 is thus
implicated as a transcriptional mediator of the ER stress response in the
osmotically stimulated SON.

CREB3L1 has been recently proposed as a novel metastasis suppressor gene in
breast cancer. Our current study highlights CREB3L1 expression, regulation, and
function in bladder cancer. We demonstrate a significant downregulation of
CREB3L1 mRNA expression (n = 64) in primary bladder cancer tissues caused by
tumor-specific CREB3L1 promoter hypermethylation (n = 51). Based on
pyrosequencing CREB3L1 methylation was shown to be potentially associated with a 
more aggressive phenotype of bladder cancer. These findings were verified by an
independent public data set containing data from 184 bladder tumors. In addition,
immunohistochemical evaluation showed that CREB3L1 protein expression is
decreased in bladder cancer tissues as well. Interestingly, protein loss is
predominately observed in the nuclei of aggressive tumor cells. Based on in vitro
models we clearly show that CREB3L1 re-expression mediates suppression of tumor
cell migration and colony growth of high grade and invasive bladder cancer cells.
The candidate tumor suppressor and TGF-ß signaling inhibitor HTRA3 was
furthermore identified as putative target gene of CREB3L1 in both invasive J82
bladder cells and primary bladder tumors. Hence, our data provide for the first
time evidence that the transcription factor CREB3L1 may have an important role as
a putative tumor suppressor in bladder cancer.

Maintenance of vascular integrity is required for embryogenesis and organ

are poorly understood. Here, we show that the histone methyltransferase Ezh2
maintains integrity of the developing vasculature by repressing a transcriptional
program that activates expression of Mmp9. Inactivation of Ezh2 in developing
mouse endothelium caused embryonic lethality with compromised vascular integrity 
and increased extracellular matrix degradation. Genome-wide approaches showed
that Ezh2 targets Mmp9 and its activators Fosl1 and Klf5. In addition, we
uncovered Creb3l1 as an Ezh2 target that directly activates Mmp9 gene expression 
in the endothelium. Furthermore, genetic inactivation of Mmp9 rescued vascular
integrity defects in Ezh2-deficient embryos. Thus, epigenetic repression of
Creb3l1, Fosl1, Klf5 and Mmp9 by Ezh2 in endothelial cells maintains the
integrity of the developing vasculature, potentially linking this transcriptional
network to diseases with compromised vascular integrity.

We report the first 2 genetically confirmed cases of primary renal sclerosing
epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF), occurring in a 17-year-old boy and a 61-year-old 
woman. In both cases, the tumors demonstrated the typical epithelioid clear cell 
morphology associated with extensive hyalinizing fibrosis, raising the
differential diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor, metanephric stromal tumor, and 
the sclerosing variant of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney. Both neoplasms
demonstrated diffuse immunoreactivity for MUC4, a highly specific marker for SEF,
and both demonstrated evidence of rearrangement of both the EWSR1 and CREB3L1
genes, which have recently been shown to be fused in this entity. Both neoplasms 
presented with metastatic disease. Primary renal SEF represents yet another
translocation-associated sarcoma now shown to arise primarily in the kidney.

Sustained induction of collagen synthesis by TGF-ß requires regulated
intramembrane proteolysis of CREB3L1.

Center, Dallas, Texas, United States of America.

CREB3L1 (cAMP response element binding protein 3-like 1), a transcription factor 
synthesized as a membrane-bound precursor and activated through Regulated
Intramembrane Proteolysis (RIP), is essential for collagen production by
osteoblasts during bone development. Here, we show that TGF-ß (transforming
growth factor-ß), a cytokine known to stimulate production of collagen during
wound healing and fibrotic diseases, induces proteolytic activation of CREB3L1 in
human A549 cells. This activation results from inhibition of expression of
TM4SF20 (transmembrane 4 L6 family member 20), which normally inhibits RIP of
CREB3L1. Cleavage of CREB3L1 releases its NH2-terminal domain from membranes,
allowing it to enter the nucleus where it binds to Smad4 to activate
transcription of genes encoding proteins required for assembly of
collagen-containing extracellular matrix. Our findings raise the possibility that
inhibition of RIP of CREB3L1 could prevent excess deposition of collagen in
certain fibrotic diseases.

A genetic dichotomy between pure sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) and
hybrid SEF/low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma: a pathologic and molecular study of 18 
cases.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is a rare soft tissue tumor exhibiting 
considerable morphologic overlap with low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS).
Moreover, both SEF and LGFMS show MUC4 expression by immunohistochemistry. While 
the majority of LGFMS cases are characterized by a FUS-CREB3L1 fusion, both
FUS-CREB3L2 and EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusions were recently demonstrated in a small
number of LGFMS and SEF/LGFMS hybrid tumors. In contrast, recent studies pointed 
out that SEF harbor frequent EWSR1 rearrangements, with only a minority of cases 
showing FUS-CREB3L2 fusions. In an effort to further characterize the molecular
characteristics of pure SEF and hybrid SEF/LGFMS lesions, we undertook a
clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical and genetic analysis of a series of 10 SEF
and 8 hybrid SEF/LGFMS tumors. The mortality rate was similar between the two
groups, 44% within the pure SEF group and 37% in the hybrid SEF/LGFMS with a mean
overall follow-up of 66 months. All but one pure SEF and all hybrid
SEF/LGFMS-tested cases showed MUC4 immunoreactivity. The majority (90%) of pure
SEF cases showed EWSR1 gene rearrangements by fluorescence in situ hybridization 
with only one case exhibiting FUS rearrangement. Of the nine EWSR1 positive
cases, six cases harbored CREB3L1 break-apart, two had CREB3L2 rearrangement (a
previously unreported finding) and one lacked evidence of CREB3L1/2
abnormalities. In contrast, all hybrid SEF/LGFMS tumors exhibited FUS and CREB3L2
rearrangements. These results further demarcate a relative cytogenetic dichotomy 
between pure SEF, often characterized by EWSR1 rearrangements, and hybrid
SEF/LGFMS, harboring FUS-CREB3L2 fusion; the latter group recapitulating the
genotype of LGFMS.

Genetics, Kumamoto University, Honjo 2-2-1, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan.

Embryonic stem (ES) cells have been shown to recapitulate normal developmental
stages. They are therefore a highly useful tool in the study of developmental
biology. Profiling of ES cell-derived cells has yielded important information
about the characteristics of differentiated cells, and allowed the identification
of novel marker genes and pathways of differentiation. In this review, we focus
on recent results from profiling studies of mouse embryos, human islets, and
human ES cell-derived differentiated cells from several research groups. Global
gene expression data from mouse embryos have been used to identify novel genes or
pathways involved in the developmental process, and to search for transcription
factors that regulate direct reprogramming. We introduce gene expression
databases of human pancreas cells (Beta Cell Gene Atlas, EuroDia database), and
summarize profiling studies of islet- or human ES cell-derived pancreatic cells, 
with a focus on gene expression, microRNAs, epigenetics, and protein expression. 
Then, we describe our gene expression profile analyses and our search for novel
endoderm, or pancreatic, progenitor marker genes. We differentiated mouse ES
cells into mesendoderm, definitive endoderm (DE), mesoderm, ectoderm, and
Pdx1-expressing pancreatic lineages, and performed DNA microarray analyses. Genes
specifically expressed in DE, and/or in Pdx1-expressing cells, were extracted and
their expression patterns in normal embryonic development were studied by in situ
hybridization. Out of 54 genes examined, 27 were expressed in the DE of E8.5
mouse embryos, and 15 genes were expressed in distinct domains in the pancreatic 
buds of E14.5 mouse embryos. Akr1c19, Aebp2, Pbxip1, and Creb3l1 were all novel, 
and none has been described as being expressed, either in the DE, or in the
pancreas. By introducing the profiling results of ES cell-derived cells, the
benefits of using ES cells to study early embryonic development will be
discussed.

We report a case of intraabdominal sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) with
a t (11;22)(p11.2;q12.2) Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1-cAMP-responsive
element-binding protein 3-like 1 translocation. A 43-year old man presented with 
massive ascites and shortness of breath. Imaging studies revealed a large
mesenteric-based mass with extensive omental/peritoneal disease. After resection 
and cytoreductive surgery, the tumor recurred with metastasis to the lungs; the
patient is still alive with disease. Histologically, there was a uniform
population of epithelioid cells arranged in cords and nests, embedded in a dense 
collagenous matrix; no areas of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma were identified.
All immunohistochemical markers were nonreactive. Fluorescence in situ
hybridization studies showed rearrangement of Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1. 
Genomic profiling by clinical grade next-generation sequencing revealed a fusion 
gene between intron 11 of Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 (22q12.2) and intron 
5 of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 3-like 1 (11p11.2). This is the
first report of "pure" or true SEF presenting as intraabdominal sarcomatosis with
confirmation of the recently described unique Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region
1-cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 3-like 1 gene fusion in SEF without
areas of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma.

Osteogenesis imperfecta due to mutations in non-collagenous genes: lessons in the
biology of bone formation.

Marini JC(1), Reich A, Smith SM.

Author information:

Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, Maryland, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Osteogenesis imperfecta or 'brittle bone disease' has mainly
been considered a bone disorder caused by collagen mutations. Within the last
decade, however, a surge of genetic discoveries has created a new paradigm for
osteogenesis imperfecta as a collagen-related disorder, where most cases are due 
to autosomal dominant type I collagen defects, while rare, mostly recessive,
forms are due to defects in genes whose protein products interact with collagen
protein. This review is both timely and relevant in outlining the genesis,
development, and future of this paradigm shift in the understanding of
osteogenesis imperfecta.
RECENT FINDINGS: Bone-restricted interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM)-like
protein (BRIL) and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) defects cause types V
and VI osteogenesis imperfecta via defective bone mineralization, while defects
in cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP), prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1), and
cyclophilin B (CYPB) cause types VII-IX osteogenesis imperfecta via defective
collagen post-translational modification. Heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) and
FK506-binding protein-65 (FKBP65) defects cause types X and XI osteogenesis
imperfecta via aberrant collagen crosslinking, folding, and chaperoning, while
defects in SP7 transcription factor, wingless-type MMTV integration site family
member 1 (WNT1), trimeric intracellular cation channel type b (TRIC-B), and old
astrocyte specifically induced substance (OASIS) disrupt osteoblast development. 
Finally, absence of the type I collagen C-propeptidase bone morphogenetic protein
1 (BMP1) causes type XII osteogenesis imperfecta due to altered collagen
maturation/processing.
SUMMARY: Identification of these multiple causative defects has provided crucial 
information for accurate genetic counseling, inspired a recently proposed
functional grouping of osteogenesis imperfecta types by shared mechanism to
simplify current nosology, and has prodded investigations into common pathways in
osteogenesis imperfecta. Such investigations could yield critical information on 
cellular and bone tissue mechanisms and translate to new mechanistic insight into
clinical therapies for patients.

We present the case of a 6-year-old boy with a deceptively bland spindle cell
renal neoplasm found to harbor the EWSR1-CREB3L1 gene fusion. This fusion has
recently been described as a variant translocation in low-grade fibromyxoid
sarcoma (LGFMS), a tumor more typically characterized by a recurrent t(7;16)
chromosomal translocation, resulting in the fusion of FUS and CREB3L2 genes.
LGFMS is an indolent tumor with late metastatic potential and a propensity for
long-term disease recurrence. The tumor is rare in children, with only 33
published cases. In the pediatric population, it has not previously been reported
arising in the kidney.

OASIS regulates chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase 1 gene transcription in the
injured adult mouse cerebral cortex.

Old astrocyte specifically induced substance (OASIS), a basic leucine zipper
transcription factor of the cAMP response element binding/Activating
transcription factor family, is induced in reactive astrocytes in vivo and has
important roles in quality control of protein synthesis at the endoplasmic
reticulum. Reactive astrocytes produce a non-permissive environment for
regenerating axons by up-regulating chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). In
this study, we focus on the potential role of OASIS in CSPG production in the
adult mouse cerebral cortex. CS-C immunoreactivity, which represents chondroitin 
sulfate moieties, was significantly attenuated in the stab-injured cortices of
OASIS knockout mice compared to those of wild-type mice. We next examined
expression of the CSPG-synthesizing enzymes and core proteins of CSPGs in the
stab-injured cortices of OASIS knockout and wild-type mice. The levels of
chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase 1 (C6ST1, one of the major enzymes involved in
sulfation of CSPGs) mRNA and protein increased after cortical stab injury of
wild-type, but not of OASIS knockout, mice. A C-terminal deletion mutant OASIS
over-expressed in rat C6 glioma cells increased C6ST1 transcription by
interacting with the first intron region. Neurite outgrowth of cultured
hippocampal neurons was inhibited on culture dishes coated with membrane
fractions of epidermal growth factor-treated astrocytes derived from wild type
but not from OASIS knockout mice. These results suggest that OASIS regulates the 
transcription of C6ST1 and thereby promotes CSPG sulfation in astrocytes. Through
these mechanisms, OASIS may modulate axonal regeneration in the injured cerebral 
cortex. OASIS, an ER stress-responsive CREB/ATF family member, is up-regulated in
the reactive astrocytes of the injured brain. We found that the up-regulated
OASIS is involved in the transcriptional regulation of C6ST1 gene, which promotes
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) sulfation. We conclude that OASIS
functions as an anti-regenerative transcription factor by establishing a
non-permissive microenvironment to regenerating axons.

Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a neurohypophysial hormone regulating hydromineral 
homeostasis. Here we show that the mRNA encoding cAMP responsive element-binding 
protein-3 like-1 (CREB3L1), a transcription factor of the CREB/activating
transcription factor (ATF) family, increases in expression in parallel with AVP
expression in supraoptic nuclei (SONs) and paraventicular nuclei (PVNs) of
dehydrated (DH) and salt-loaded (SL) rats, compared with euhydrated (EH)
controls. In EH animals, CREB3L1 protein is expressed in glial cells, but only at
a low level in SON and PVN neurons, whereas robust upregulation in AVP neurons
accompanied DH and SL rats. Concomitantly, CREB3L1 is activated by cleavage, with
the N-terminal domain translocating from the Golgi, via the cytosol, to the
nucleus. We also show that CREB3L1 mRNA levels correlate with AVP transcription
level in SONs and PVNs following sodium depletion, and as a consequence of
diurnal rhythm in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. We tested the hypothesis that
CREB3L1 activates AVP gene transcription. Both full-length and constitutively
active forms of CREB3L1 (CREB3L1CA) induce the expression of rat AVP
promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, whereas a dominant-negative mutant
reduces expression. Rat AVP promoter deletion constructs revealed that CRE-like
and G-box sequences in the region between -170 and -120 bp are important for
CREB3L1 actions. Direct binding of CREB3L1 to the AVP promoter was shown by
chromatin immunoprecipitation both in vitro and in the SON itself. Injection of a
lentiviral vector expressing CREB3L1CA into rat SONs and PVNs resulted in
increased AVP biosynthesis. We thus identify CREB3L1 as a regulator of AVP
transcription in the rat hypothalamus.

OASIS is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transmembrane transcription factor that is
activated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Previously, we showed
that OASIS regulates final maturation of goblet cells in the large intestine. In 
the present study, to elucidate the roles of OASIS under pathophysiological
conditions, we examined the stress response and inflammatory responses in Oasis
deficient (Oasis<U+207B>/<U+207B>) mice exposed to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to induce
colitis. A significant loss of body weight and an increase of mortality were
observed in Oasis<U+207B>/<U+207B> mice with DSS-induced colitis compared with those in WT
mice. The mucosa of the large intestine in Oasis<U+207B>/<U+207B> mice exhibited severe damage 
involving inflammatory cell infiltration. The expression levels of ER stress and 
apoptosis markers in intestinal epithelial cells were upregulated in Oasis<U+207B>/<U+207B>
mice. These abnormalities were improved by treatment with tauroursodeoxycholic
acid, a chemical chaperone that facilitates protein folding. Taken together, our 
findings demonstrate that OASIS plays important roles in protection of the large 
intestinal mucosa in DSS-induced colitis through attenuation of ER stress and
inflammation.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma
(LGFMS) are 2 distinct types of sarcoma, with a subset of cases showing
overlapping morphologic and immunohistochemical features. LGFMS is characterized 
by expression of the MUC4 protein, and about 90% of cases display a distinctive
FUS-CREB3L2 gene fusion. In addition, SEF is often MUC4 positive, but is
genetically less well studied. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies 
have shown involvement of the FUS gene in the majority of so-called hybrid
LGFMS/SEF and in 10% to 25% of sarcomas with pure SEF morphology. In this study, 
we investigated a series of 10 primary tumors showing pure SEF morphology, 4
cases of LGFMS that at local or distant relapse showed predominant SEF
morphology, and 1 primary hybrid LGFMS/SEF. All but 1 case showed diffuse
expression for MUC4. Using FISH, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction,
and/or mRNA sequencing in selected cases, we found recurrent EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion
transcripts by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in 3/10 pure SEF
cases and splits and deletions of the EWSR1 and/or CREB3L1 genes by FISH in 6
additional cases. All 5 cases of LGFMS with progression to SEF morphology or
hybrid features had FUS-CREB3L2 fusion transcripts. Our results indicate that
EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements are predominant over FUS and CREB3L2
rearrangements in pure SEF, highlighting that SEF and LGFMS are different tumor
types, with different impacts on patient outcome.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a central cellular organelle responsible for
the synthesis, folding and posttranslational modifications of proteins destined
for the secretory pathway. Various pathophysiological conditions, such as
ER-calcium depletion, oxidative stress, hypoglycemia, expression of mutated
proteins and hypoxia, interfere with the correct folding of proteins and these
misfolded or unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER lumen. These conditions,
which are collectively termed ER stress, have the potential to induce cellular
damage. Recently, the ER stress has been demonstrated to be associated with bone 
and cartilage diseases. Further, it has been known that the ER stress and its
stress response also play important roles in osteogenesis and chondrogenesis.

Physiological functions of endoplasmic reticulum stress transducer OASIS in
central nervous system.

Eukaryotic cells can adapt to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction by producing
diverse signals from the ER to the cytosol or nucleus. These signaling pathways
are collectively known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). The canonical
branches of the UPR are mediated by three ER membrane-bound proteins:
double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum
kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1) and activating transcription
factor 6 (ATF6). These ER stress transducers basically play important roles in
cell survival after ER stress. Recently, novel types of ER stress transducers
that share a region of high sequence similarity with ATF6 have been identified.
They have a transmembrane domain, which allows them to associate with the ER, and
possess a transcription-activation domain and a basic leucine zipper (bZIP)
domain. These membrane-bound bZIP transcription factors include OASIS, BBF2H7
CREBH, CREB4 and Luman, and are collectively referred to as OASIS family members.
Despite their structural similarities with ATF6, differences in activating
stimuli and tissue distribution indicate specialized functions of each member on 
regulating UPR signaling in specific organs and tissues. One of them, OASIS, is
expressed preferentially in astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). OASIS
temporally regulates the differentiation from neural precursor cells into
astrocytes to promote the expression of Glial Cell Missing 1 through dynamic
interactions among OASIS family members followed by accelerating demethylation of
the Gfap promoter. This review is a summary of our current understanding of the
physiological functions of OASIS in the CNS.

Various cellular conditions such as synthesis of abundant proteins, expressions
of mutant proteins and oxidative stress lead to accumulation of unfolded or
misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. This type of stress
is called ER stress. The excessive ER stress causes cellular damages followed by 
apoptosis. When ER stress occurs, cells are activated ER stress response
(unfolded protein response) to avoid cellular damages. Recently, it has been
clear that ER stress response plays crucial roles not only in cell survival after
ER stress but also in regulating various cellular functions and tissue
formations. In particular, ER stress and ER stress response regulate protein
quality control, secretory protein production, and smooth secretion of proteins
in the cells such as osteoblasts which synthesize and secrete enormous matrix
proteins.

The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated in response to hypoxia-induced
stress such as in the tumor microenvironment. This study examined the role of
CREB3L1 (cyclic AMP [cAMP]-responsive element-binding protein 3-like protein 1), 
a member of the UPR, in breast cancer development and metastasis. Initial
experiments identified the loss of CREB3L1 expression in metastatic breast cancer
cell lines compared to low-metastasis or nonmetastatic cell lines. When
metastatic cells were transfected with CREB3L1, they demonstrated reduced
invasion and migration in vitro, as well as a significantly decreased ability to 
survive under nonadherent or hypoxic conditions. Interestingly, in an in vivo rat
mammary tumor model, not only did CREB3L1-expressing cells fail to form
metastases compared to CREB3L1 null cells but regression of the primary tumors
was seen in 70% of the animals as a result of impaired angiogenesis. Microarray
and chromatin immunoprecipitation with microarray technology (ChIP on Chip)
analyses identified changes in the expression of many genes involved in cancer
development and metastasis, including a decrease in those involved in
angiogenesis. These data suggest that CREB3L1 plays an important role in
suppressing tumorigenesis and that loss of expression is required for the
development of a metastatic phenotype.

Roles of regulated intramembrane proteolysis in virus infection and antiviral
immunity.

Regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) is a signaling mechanism through which 
transmembrane precursor proteins are cleaved to liberate their cytoplasmic and/or
luminal/extracellular fragments from membranes so that these fragments are able
to function at a new location. Recent studies have indicated that this
proteolytic reaction plays an important role in host-virus interaction. On one
hand, RIP transfers the signal from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to nucleus to 
activate antiviral genes in response to alteration of the ER caused by viral
infection. On the other hand, RIP can be hijacked by virus to process
transmembrane viral protein precursors and to destroy transmembrane antiviral
proteins. Understanding this Yin and Yang side of RIP may lead to new strategies 
to combat viral infection. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled:
Intramembrane Proteases.

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous
brittle bone disorder. Whereas dominant OI is mostly due to heterozygous
mutations in either COL1A1 or COL1A2, encoding type I procollagen, recessive OI
is caused by biallelic mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in type I
procollagen processing or chaperoning. Hitherto, some OI cases remain molecularly
unexplained. We detected a homozygous genomic deletion of CREB3L1 in a family
with severe OI. CREB3L1 encodes OASIS, an endoplasmic reticulum-stress transducer
that regulates type I procollagen expression during murine bone formation. This
is the first report linking CREB3L1 to human recessive OI, thereby expanding the 
OI gene spectrum.

Although identification of substrates for an enzyme is a key step in elucidation 
of its biological functions, detection of the interaction between enzymes and
substrates remains challenging. We recently developed a new approach, termed
differential proteomics-based identification of ubiquitylation substrates
(DiPIUS), for the discovery of substrates of ubiquitin ligases. We have now
applied this approach to Fbxw7, the F-box protein component of an Skp1-Cul1-F-box
protein-type ubiquitin ligase and, thereby, identified two similar transcription 
factors, old astrocyte specifically induced substance (OASIS) and BBF2 human
homolog on chromosome 7 (BBF2H7), as candidate substrates. Coimmunoprecipitation 
analysis confirmed that the a and <U+03B3> isoforms of Fbxw7 interact with OASIS and
BBF2H7 in vivo. Sustained overexpression of Fbxw7 resulted in marked
down-regulation of OASIS and BBF2H7, whereas RNAi-mediated Fbxw7 depletion
stabilized both proteins. Mutation of a putative Cdc4 phosphodegron in OASIS and 
BBF2H7 attenuated their association with Fbxw7 and resulted in their
stabilization. Depletion of Fbxw7 promoted the differentiation of mouse C2C12
mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts in association with the accumulation of OASIS.
Conversely, overexpression of Fbxw7 in C2C12 cells resulted in down-regulation of
Col1A1 mRNA, a target of OASIS. Conditional ablation of Fbxw7 in primary mouse
mesenchymal cells promoted chondrogenesis in association with up-regulation of
BBF2H7, whereas overexpression of Fbxw7 inhibited chondrogenesis in ATDC5 cells. 
Collectively, our results suggest that OASIS and BBF2H7 are bona fide substrates 
of Fbxw7 and that Fbxw7 controls osteogenesis and chondrogenesis by targeting
OASIS and BBF2H7, respectively, for degradation.

AIM: To develop novel biomarkers of rectal radiotherapy, we measured gene
expression profiles on biopsies taken before and during preoperative
radiotherapy.
METHODS: Six patients presenting with a locally advanced rectal cancer (T>T2,
N0/Nx, M0) eligible for preoperative radiotherapy (45 Gy in 25 fractions) were
selected in a pilot study. Six tumor and 3 normal tissues biopsies were taken
before and during radiotherapy, after a dose of 7.2 Gy at a median time of 1 h
following irradiation (0:27-2:12). Tumor or normal tissue purity was assessed by 
a pathologist prior to RNA extraction. Mean RNA content was 23 µg/biopsy (14-37) 
before radiotherapy and 22.7 µg/biopsy (12-35) during radiotherapy. After RNA
amplification, biopsies were analysed with 54K HG-U133A Plus 2.0 Affymetrix
expression micro-arrays. Data were normalized according to MAS5 algorithm. A gene
expression ratio was calculated as: (gene expression during radiotherapy - gene
expression before radiotherapy)/gene expression before radiotherapy. Were
selected genes that showed a ratio higher than ± 0.5 in all 6 patients.
RESULTS: Microarray analysis showed that preoperative radiotherapy significantly 
up-regulated 31 genes and down-regulated 6 genes. According to the Gene Ontology 
project classification, these genes are involved in protein metabolism (ADAMDEC1;
AKAP7; CAPN5; CLIC5; CPE; CREB3L1; NEDD4L; RAB27A), ion transport (AKAP7; ATP2A3;
CCL28; CLIC5; F2RL2; NEDD4L; SLC6A8), transcription (AKAP7; CREB3L1; ISX;
PABPC1L; TXNIP), signal transduction (CAPN5; F2RL2; RAB27A; TNFRSF11A), cell
adhesion (ADAMDEC1; PXDN; SPON1; S100A2), immune response (CCL28; PXDN;
TNFRSF11A) and apoptosis (ITM2C; PDCD4; PVT1). Up-regulation of 3 genes (CCL28;
CLIC5; PDCD4) was detected by 2 different probes and up-regulation of 2 genes
(RAB27A; TXNIP) by 3 probes.
CONCLUSION: Micro-arrays can efficiently assess early transcriptomic changes
during preoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer, and may help better
understand tumor radioresistance.

Transformation of epithelial cells by high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV)
types can lead to anogenital carcinomas, particularly cervical cancer, and
oropharyngeal cancers. This process is associated with DNA methylation
alterations, often affecting tumour suppressor gene expression. This study aimed 
to comprehensively unravel genome-wide DNA methylation events linked to a
transforming hrHPV-infection, which is driven by deregulated expression of the
viral oncogenes E6 and E7 in dividing cells. Primary human keratinocytes
transduced with HPV16E6E7 and their untransduced counterparts were subjected to
methylation-specific digital karyotyping (MSDK) to screen for genome-wide
DNA-methylation changes at different stages of HPV-induced transformation.
Integration of the obtained methylation profiles with genome-wide gene expression
patterns of cervical carcinomas identified 34 genes with increased methylation in
HPV-transformed cells and reduced expression in cervical carcinomas. For 12 genes
(CLIC3, CREB3L1, FAM19A4, LFNG, LHX1, MRC2, NKX2-8, NPTX-1, PHACTR3, PRDM14, SOST
and TNFSF13) specific methylation in HPV-containing cell lines was confirmed by
semi-quantitative methylation-specific PCR. Subsequent analysis of FAM19A4, LHX1,
NKX2-8, NPTX-1, PHACTR3 and PRDM14 in cervical tissue specimens showed increasing
methylation levels for all genes with disease progression. All six genes were
frequently methylated in cervical carcinomas, with highest frequencies (up to
100%) seen for FAM19A4, PHACTR3 and PRDM14. Analysis of hrHPV-positive cervical
scrapes revealed significantly increased methylation levels of the latter three
genes in women with high-grade cervical disease compared to controls. In
conclusion, MSDK analysis of HPV16-transduced keratinocytes at different stages
of HPV-induced transformation resulted in the identification of novel DNA
methylation events, involving FAM19A4, LHX1, NKX2-8, PHACTR3 and PRDM14 genes in 
cervical carcinogenesis. These genes may provide promising triage markers to
assess the presence of (pre)cancerous cervical lesions in hrHPV-positive women.

Root formation is initiated with the extension of Hertwig's epithelial root
sheath (HERS) after crown morphogenesis. To date, little is known about the
molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling root formation. Recently we found
rootless molars are formed in the dental mesenchyme-specific ß-catenin
conditional knockout mice. The striking root phenotypes of these mutant mice
result from the disrupted differentiation of differentiating odontoblasts, caused
by ablation of ß-catenin during initiation of root formation. Here we show the
cellular and molecular characteristics of differentiating odontoblasts using
histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. These cells were not found in crown
formation, but appeared only in the apical end of developing tooth, thus we have 
named these cells "apical odontoblasts" (AOds). AOds appeared immediately after
HERS formation and were always present on the apical side of developing roots
until root formation was complete. These findings indicate that AOds are closely 
associated with the transition from crown to root and with root elongation. In
AOds, several transcription factors, including Nfic, Creb3l1, and Osx, as well as
ß-catenin and alkaline phosphatase were expressed but Phex and Dspp were not
expressed. Taken together, our results indicate that AOds are the principal cells
responsible for tooth root formation. These findings may contribute to the
further understanding of the mechanisms underlying tooth root formation and root 
regeneration.

EWSR1-CREB3L1 gene fusion: a novel alternative molecular aberration of low-grade 
fibromyxoid sarcoma.

Comment in
    Am J Surg Pathol. 2013 Oct;37(10):1630-1.

Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) is an uncommon sarcoma with a deceptively
bland-looking morphology that disguises its malignant clinical behavior. It shows
distinctive chromosomal translocations resulting in fusion of FUS with the
CREB3L2 gene in most cases and CREB3L1 in rare cases. Thus molecular studies are 
particularly helpful in the diagnosis of this bland-looking sarcoma. We report 2 
cases of LGFMS serendipitously found to harbor a novel alternative EWSR1-CREB3L1 
gene fusion, as confirmed by DNA sequencing of reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction products and fluorescence in situ hybridization. One patient was a
child who presented with a subcutaneous nodule on the lower leg, and the other
was a middle-aged woman who had a mass lesion over the proximal thigh.
Morphologically, one case showed a spindle cell tumor with hyalinization and
giant rosettes, whereas the other showed classical histology of LGFMS with focal 
metaplastic bone formation. Immunostaining for MUC4 showed extensive positive
staining. Our findings therefore expand the spectrum of gene fusions that
characterize LGFMS and suggest that the EWSR1 gene may substitute for the
function of FUS in gene fusions of sarcoma.

Transcriptional regulation of VEGFA by the endoplasmic reticulum stress
transducer OASIS in ARPE-19 cells.

BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA) is the main mediator of 
angiogenesis. Angiogenesis plays important roles not only in many physiological
processes, but also in the pathophysiology of many diseases. VEGFA is one of the 
therapeutic targets of treatment for ocular diseases with neovascularization.
Therefore, elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms for VEGFA expression is
important for the development of pharmaceutical drugs. Recent studies have
demonstrated that the unfolded protein response is involved in the
transcriptional regulation of VEGFA. However, the precise regulation of VEGFA in 
the human retina is not fully understood.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: When human retinal pigment epithelial cells, ARPE-19, were
exposed to endoplasmic reticulum stressors, VEGFA mRNA was significantly
upregulated. The unfolded protein response-related transcription factors XBP1,
ATF4, ATF6, and OASIS were expressed in ARPE-19 cells. To determine which
transcription factors preferentially contribute to the induction of VEGFA
expression after endoplasmic reticulum stress, we carried out reporter assays
using an approximately 6-kbp 5'-upstream region of the human VEGFA gene. Among
these transcription factors, OASIS acted most effectively on the VEGFA promoter
in ARPE-19 cells. Based on data obtained for certain deleted and mutated reporter
constructs, we determined that OASIS promoted VEGFA expression by acting on a
cyclic AMP-responsive element-like site located at around -500 bp relative to the
VEGFA transcription start site. Furthermore, we confirmed that OASIS directly
bound to the promoter region containing this site by chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays.
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: We have demonstrated a novel regulatory mechanism
for VEGFA transcription by OASIS in human retinal pigment epithelial cells.
Chemical compounds that regulate the binding of OASIS to the promoter region of
the VEGFA gene may have potential as therapeutic agents for ocular diseases with 
neovascularization.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and has multiple risk
factors including joint injury. The purpose of this study was to characterize the
histologic development of OA in a mouse model where OA is induced by
destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM model) and to identify genes
regulated during different stages of the disease, using RNA isolated from the
joint "organ" and analyzed using microarrays. Histologic changes seen in OA,
including articular cartilage lesions and osteophytes, were present in the medial
tibial plateaus of the DMM knees beginning at the earliest (2 week) time point
and became progressively more severe by 16 weeks. 427 probe sets (371 genes) from
the microarrays passed consistency and significance filters. There was an initial
up-regulation at 2 and 4 weeks of genes involved in morphogenesis,
differentiation, and development, including growth factor and matrix genes, as
well as transcription factors including Atf2, Creb3l1, and Erg. Most genes were
off or down-regulated at 8 weeks with the most highly down-regulated genes
involved in cell division and the cytoskeleton. Gene expression increased at 16
weeks, in particular extracellular matrix genes including Prelp, Col3a1 and
fibromodulin. Immunostaining revealed the presence of these three proteins in
cartilage and soft tissues including ligaments as well as in the fibrocartilage
covering osteophytes. The results support a phasic development of OA with early
matrix remodeling and transcriptional activity followed by a more quiescent
period that is not maintained. This implies that the response to an OA
intervention will depend on the timing of the intervention. The quiescent period 
at 8 weeks may be due to the maturation of the osteophytes which are thought to
temporarily stabilize the joint.

OASIS/CREB3L1 is induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress in human glioma cell
lines and contributes to the unfolded protein response, extracellular matrix
production and cell migration.

OASIS is a transcription factor similar to ATF6 that is activated by endoplasmic 
reticulum stress. In this study we investigated the expression of OASIS in human 
glioma cell lines and the effect of OASIS knock-down on the ER stress response
and cell migration. OASIS mRNA was detected in three distinct glioma cell lines
(U373, A172 and U87) and expression levels were increased upon treatment with ER 
stress-inducing compounds in the U373 and U87 lines. OASIS protein, which is
glycosylated on Asn-513, was detected in the U373 and U87 glioma lines at low
levels in control cells and protein expression was induced by ER stress.
Knock-down of OASIS in human glioma cell lines resulted in an attenuated unfolded
protein response to ER stress (reduced GRP78/BiP and GRP94 induction) and
decreased expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan extracellular matrix
proteins, but induction of the collagen gene Col1a1 was unaffected. Cells in
which OASIS was knocked-down exhibited altered cell morphology and reduced cell
migration. These results suggest that OASIS is important for the ER stress
response and maintenance of some extracellular matrix proteins in human glioma
cells.

protein genes in the glial scar and inhibits neurite outgrowth.

OASIS gene, a member of the CREB/ATF transcription factor family, is upregulated 
in gliosis after CNS injury. However it remains to be determined how OASIS is
implicated in gliotic reaction. In a glial scar, chondroitin sulfate
proteoglycans (CSPGs) are also upregulated, which engenders the inhibition of
axonal regeneration. We investigated the functional role of OASIS in gliosis in
relation to CSPG core proteins that render lesions non-permissive for
regenerating axons. We first examined the gene expression localization of OASIS
using several markers in a cryo-injured mouse brain and compared the expression
pattern of CSPG core protein genes with that of OASIS in a glial scar by
double-labeling in situ hybridization. Our findings suggest that OASIS is induced
in proximal reactive astrocytes that exhibit upregulated expression for CSPGs,
including NG2 proteoglycan, versican, brevican, neurocan, and phosphacan core.
Furthermore, the membrane fraction derived from OASIS-transfected C6 cells
inhibits neurite outgrowth of NG108-15 cells, whereas its neurite outgrowth
inhibitory effect is abrogated after chondroitinase ABC treatment. OASIS is
likely to be involved in the regulatory mechanism of non-permissive environments 
for axonal outgrowth.

Doxorubicin blocks proliferation of cancer cells through proteolytic activation
of CREB3L1.

Doxorubicin is used extensively for chemotherapy of diverse types of cancer, yet 
the mechanism through which it inhibits proliferation of cancer cells remains
unclear. Here we report that doxorubicin stimulates de novo synthesis of
ceramide, which in turn activates CREB3L1, a transcription factor synthesized as 
a membrane-bound precursor. Doxorubicin stimulates proteolytic cleavage of
CREB3L1 by Site-1 Protease and Site-2 Protease, allowing the NH(2)-terminal
domain of CREB3L1 to enter the nucleus where it activates transcription of genes 
encoding inhibitors of the cell cycle, including p21. Knockdown of CREB3L1 mRNA
in human hepatoma Huh7 cells and immortalized human fibroblast SV589 cells
conferred increased resistance to doxorubicin, whereas overexpression of CREB3L1 
in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells markedly enhanced the sensitivity of these
cells to doxorubicin. These results suggest that measurement of CREB3L1
expression may be a useful biomarker in identifying cancer cells sensitive to
doxorubicin.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00090.001.

Estrus synchronization and ovarian hyper-stimulation treatments have negligible
effects on cumulus oocyte complex gene expression whereas induction of ovulation 
causes major expression changes.

The effects of exogenous hormones, used for estrus synchronization and ovarian
hyper stimulation, on cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) gene expression in sexually
mature rats were determined using microarrays. Gene expression in COCs collected 
from GnRH (G(trt)), GnRH + eCG (G + E(trt)), and GnRH + eCG + hCG (G + E +
H(trt)) treatments were compared to COCs from naturally cycling (NC) rats before 
the preovulatory luteninizing hormone surge. There was no significant difference 
in gene expression among NC, G(trt), and G + E(trt); however, over 2,600 genes
were significantly different between NC and G + E + H(trt) (P < 0.05). Genes
upregulated in G + E + H(trt) encode for: proteins that are involved in
prostaglandin synthesis (Ptgs2, Pla2g4a, and Runx1) and cholesterol biosynthesis 
(Hmgcr, Sc4mol, and Dhcr24); receptors that allow cholesterol uptake (Ldlr and
Scarb1), regulate progesterone synthesis (Star), and inactivate estrogen
(Sult1e1); and downstream effectors of LH signal (Pgr, Cebpb, Creb3l1, Areg,
Ereg, and Adamts1). Conversely, G + E + H(trt) downregulated genes encoding
proteins involved in: DNA replication and cell cycle progression (Ccne2, Orc5l,
Rad50, and Mcm6); reproductive developmental process; and granulosa cell
expansion (Gdf9, Bmp15, Amh, Amhr2, Bmpr1b, Tgfb2, Foxl2, Pde3a, Esr2, Fshr,
Ybx2, Ccnd2, Ccnb1ip1, and Zp3); maternal effect genes required for embryo
development (Zar1, Npm2, Nlrp5, Dnmt1, H1foo, and Zfp57); amino acid degradation;
and ketogenesis (Hmgcs2, and Cpt1b). These results from the rat show that
hormones used for estrus synchronization (G(trt)) and ovarian hyper stimulation
(G + E(trt)) had minimal effects on gene expression, whereas induction of
ovulation (G + E + H(trt)) caused major changes in gene expression of rat COCs.
This study provides comprehensive information about regulated genes during late
follicle development and ovulation induction.

Epigenetic silencing of antiviral genes renders clones of Huh-7 cells permissive 
for hepatitis C virus replication.

Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) does not replicate efficiently in wild-type human
hepatoma Huh-7 cells, but it replicates robustly in certain subclones of Huh-7
cells. Previously, we demonstrated that silencing of cyclic AMP (cAMP) response
element binding protein 3-like 1 (CREB3L1), a cellular transcription factor that 
inhibits HCV replication, allows HCV to replicate in HRP1 cells, a subclone of
Huh-7 cells permissive for HCV replication. Here we show that silencing of
myxovirus resistant 1 (MX1), a known interferon-induced antiviral gene, is
responsible for HRP4 cells, another subclone of Huh-7 cells, being permissive for
HCV replication. Both CREB3L1 and MX1 are epigenetically silenced through DNA
methylation in HRP1 and HRP4 cells, respectively. We further demonstrate that
Huh-7 cells exist as a mixed population of cells with distinct patterns of gene
methylation and HCV replicates in subpopulations of Huh-7 cells that have
antiviral genes epigenetically silenced by DNA hypermethylation. Our results
demonstrate that understanding the mechanism through which subclones of Huh-7
cells become permissive for HCV replication is crucial for studying their
interaction with HCV.

Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (previously known as Evans tumor) is a rare soft
tissue neoplasm characterized by a deceptively bland appearance despite the
potential for late metastasis or recurrence. We describe a 13-year-old patient
with a popliteal fossa mass initially thought to be benign that, because of
array-comparative genomic hybridization findings and subsequent
immunohistochemistry, was diagnosed as low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma. The
array-comparative genomic hybridization demonstrated a loss of 11p11.2p15.5 and a
gain of 16p11.2p13.3 with breakpoints involving the CREB3L1 (cAMP responsive
element-binding protein 3-like 1) and FUS (fused in sarcoma) genes, respectively.
Subsequent fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of a dual-labeled
break-apart FUS probe on interphase cells was positive. Our case highlights the
importance of using genetic information obtained via array-comparative genomic
hybridization to classify accurately pediatric soft tissue tumors.

MUC4 is a sensitive and extremely useful marker for sclerosing epithelioid
fibrosarcoma: association with FUS gene rearrangement.

Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is a rare aggressive fibroblastic
neoplasm composed of cords of epithelioid cells embedded in a dense collagenous
stroma. The reported immunophenotype of SEF is nonspecific. Some SEF cases show
morphologic and molecular overlap with low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS),
suggesting a relationship between these tumor types. MUC4 has recently been
identified as a sensitive and specific marker for LGFMS; MUC4 expression was also
observed in 2 tumors with hybrid features of SEF and LGFMS. We investigated MUC4 
expression in SEF and other epithelioid soft tissue tumors to determine (1) the
potential diagnostic utility of MUC4 for SEF and (2) the association between MUC4
expression and FUS rearrangement in SEF. Whole sections of 180 tumors were
evaluated: 41 cases of SEF (including 29 "pure" SEF and 12 hybrid LGFMS-SEF), 20 
epithelioid sarcomas, 11 clear cell sarcomas, 11 metastatic melanomas, 10
perivascular epithelioid cell tumors, 10 alveolar soft part sarcomas, 10
epithelioid angiosarcomas, 10 epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas, 10 epithelioid
gastrointestinal stromal tumors, 10 myoepithelial carcinomas, 17 ossifying
fibromyxoid tumors, 10 leiomyosarcomas, and 10 biphasic synovial sarcomas.
Immunohistochemical analysis was performed after antigen retrieval using a mouse 
anti-MUC4 monoclonal antibody. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was
performed on 33 SEF cases using FUS break-apart probes. A subset of cases was
also evaluated for EWSR1 and CREB3L2/L1 rearrangements by FISH. Strong diffuse
cytoplasmic staining for MUC4 was observed in 32 of 41 (78%) cases of SEF,
including all 12 hybrid tumors. FUS rearrangement was detected in 8 of 21 (38%)
MUC4-positive cases of SEF with successful FISH studies. The prevalence of FUS
rearrangement was similar in hybrid LGFMS-SEF (2 of 6; 33%) and SEF without an
LGFMS component (6 of 15; 40%). FUS rearrangement was not detected in any cases
of MUC4-negative SEF. Two hybrid tumors had both EWSR1 and CREB3L1
rearrangements. MUC4 expression was also seen in 9 of 10 (90%) biphasic synovial 
sarcomas, predominantly in the glandular component. All other tumor types were
negative for MUC4, apart from focal reactivity in 5 ossifying fibromyxoid tumors,
2 epithelioid gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and 1 myoepithelial carcinoma.
MUC4 is a sensitive and relatively specific marker for SEF among epithelioid soft
tissue tumors. MUC4 expression occurs more frequently than FUS rearrangement in
SEF. The finding of EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements in 2 cases of hybrid
LGFMS-SEF suggests that SEFs are genetically heterogenous. MUC4-positive SEFs
with FUS rearrangement are likely closely related to LGFMS. MUC4-positive SEFs
that lack FUS rearrangement may be related to LGFMS but could have alternate
fusion partners, including EWSR1. SEF without MUC4 expression may represent a
distinct group of tumors. MUC4 expression correlates with glandular epithelial
differentiation in biphasic synovial sarcoma and is very limited in other
epithelioid soft tissue tumors.

promotes astrocyte differentiation.

OASIS is a member of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors and modulates
cell- or tissue-specific unfolded protein response signalling. Here we show that 
this modulation has a critical role in the differentiation of neural precursor
cells into astrocytes. Cerebral cortices of mice specifically deficient in OASIS 
(Oasis(-/-)) contain fewer astrocytes and more neural precursor cells than those 
of wild-type mice during embryonic development. Furthermore, astrocyte
differentiation is delayed in primary cultured Oasis(-/-) neural precursor cells.
The transcription factor Gcm1, which is necessary for astrocyte differentiation
in Drosophila, is revealed to be a target of OASIS. Introduction of Gcm1 into
Oasis(-/-) neural precursor cells improves the delayed differentiation of neural 
precursor cells into astrocytes by accelerating demethylation of the Gfap
promoter. Gcm1 expression is temporally controlled by the unfolded protein
response through interactions between OASIS family members during astrocyte
differentiation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism by
which OASIS and its associated family members are modulated by the unfolded
protein response to finely control astrocyte differentiation.

Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma is a rare soft tissue sarcoma of fibroblastic
differentiation characterized by a deceptively benign morphologic appearance with
almost consistent MUC4 expression and recurrent chromosomal translocations,
t(7;16)(q34;p11) and t(11;16)(p11;p11), resulting in the FUS-CREB3L2 and
FUS-CREB3L1 fusion genes, respectively. A subset of the tumors show peculiar
histologic features, designated as giant rosettes, and were formerly referred to 
as hyalinizing spindle cell tumor with giant rosettes. We herein report a case of
low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma showing the presence of numerous giant rosettes,
with and without collagenous centers, distributed throughout the lesion and
unusual rim-like heterotopic ossification. Such a case might present a diagnostic
challenge. The diagnosis of the tumor was confirmed by positive immunoreactivity 
to MUC4 and the FUS-CREB3L2 fusion detected by molecular testing using
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. This case, which has such unusual
clinicopathologic features, would help to further expand our knowledge regarding 
the morphologic diversities of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma.

stabilization.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress transducers transduce signals from the ER to
the cytoplasm and nucleus when unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER. BBF2 human
homolog on chromosome 7 (BBF2H7) and old astrocyte specifically induced substance
(OASIS), ER-resident transmembrane proteins, have recently been identified as
novel ER stress transducers that have roles in chondrogenesis and osteogenesis,
respectively. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the activation of
BBF2H7 and OASIS under ER stress conditions remain unresolved. Here, we showed
that BBF2H7 and OASIS are notably unstable proteins that are easily degraded via 
the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway under normal conditions. ER stress conditions
enhanced the stability of BBF2H7 and OASIS, and promoted transcription of their
target genes. HMG-CoA reductase degradation 1 (HRD1), an ER-resident E3 ubiquitin
ligase, ubiquitinated BBF2H7 and OASIS under normal conditions, whereas ER stress
conditions dissociated the interaction between HRD1 and BBF2H7 or OASIS. The
stabilization of OASIS in Hrd1(-/-) cells enhanced the expression of collagen
fibers during osteoblast differentiation, whereas a knockdown of OASIS in
Hrd1(-/-) cells suppressed the production of collagen fibers. These findings
suggest that ER stress stabilizes OASIS family members and this is a novel
molecular mechanism for the activation of ER stress transducers.

differentiation of goblet cells in the large intestine.

OASIS is a basic leucine zipper transmembrane transcription factor localized in
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that is cleaved in its transmembrane region in
response to ER stress. This novel ER stress transducer has been demonstrated to
express in osteoblasts and astrocytes and promote terminal maturation of these
cells. Additionally, OASIS is highly expressed in goblet cells of the large
intestine. In this study, we investigated the roles of OASIS in goblet cell
differentiation in the large intestine. To analyze the functions of OASIS in
goblet cells, we examined morphological changes and the expression of goblet cell
differentiation markers in the large intestine of Oasis(-/-) mice. By disrupting 
the Oasis gene, the number of goblet cells and production of mucus were decreased
in the large intestine. Oasis(-/-) goblet cells showed abnormal morphology of
mucous vesicles and rough ER. The expression levels of mature goblet cell markers
were lower, and conversely those of early goblet cell markers were higher in
Oasis(-/-) mice, indicating that differentiation from early to mature goblet
cells is impaired in Oasis(-/-) mice. To determine the association of OASIS with 
other factors involved in goblet cell differentiation, in vitro experiments using
a cell culture model were performed. We found that OASIS was activated in
response to mild ER stress that is induced in differentiating goblet cells.
Knockdown of the Oasis transcript perturbed goblet cell terminal differentiation.
Together, our data indicate that OASIS plays crucial roles in promoting the
differentiation of early goblet cells to mature goblet cells in the large
intestine.

Differentiation process of osteoblasts, which play a central role in bone
formation, is harmoniously controlled by several cytokines and hormones.
Particularly, Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) , Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) , and Wnt 
family proteins are important cytokines for osteoblast differentiation.
Understandings of molecular mechanisms by which these cytokines stimulate
osteoblast differentiation have been extensively investigated. BMP/Smad
signaling, canonical Wnt pathway, non-canonical Wnt pathway and Ihh/Gli signaling
play critical role in osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, biochemical and
genetic studies have demonstrated important roles of Runt related transcription
factor 2 (Runx2) , Osterix, Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) , Msh
homeobox 2 (Msx2) and Oasis for osteoblast differentiation. Thus, these milestone
studies have dramatically progressed in our understanding of the cellular and
molecular mechanisms of osteoblast differentiation for 20 years.

Tunicamycin negatively regulates BMP2-induced osteoblast differentiation through 
CREBH expression in MC3T3E1 cells.

Tunicamycin, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducer, specifically inhibits 
N-glycosylation. The cyclic AMP (cAMP) response element-binding protein H (CREBH)
was previously shown to be regulated by UPR-dependent proteolytic cleavage in the
liver. On the other hand, the role of CREBH in other tissues is unknown. In the
present study, tunicamycin increased the level of CREBH activation (cleavage) as 
well as mRNA expression in osteoblast cells. Adenoviral (Ad) overexpression of
CREBH suppressed BMP2-induced expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and
osteocalcin (OC). Interestingly, the BMP2-induced OASIS (structurally similar to 
CREBH, a positive regulator of osteoblast differentiation) expression was also
inhibited by CREBH overexpression. In addition, inhibition of CREBH expression
using siRNA reversed the tunicamycin-suppressed ALP and OC expression. These
results suggest that CREBH inhibited osteoblast differentiation via suppressing
BMP2-induced ALP, OC and OASIS expression in mouse calvarial derived osteoblasts.

transcription.

Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) activates unfolded protein response (UPR)
transducers, such as PERK and OASIS, in osteoblast cells. ATF6, a bZIP
transcription factor, is also a UPR transducer. However, the involvement of ATF6 
in BMP2-induced osteoblast differentiation has not yet been elucidated. In the
present study, BMP2 treatment was shown to markedly induce the expression and
activation of ATF6 with an increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and OC
expression in MC3T3E1 cells. In contrast, ATF6 activation by BMP2 was not
observed in the Runx2(-/-) primary calvarial osteoblasts, and Runx2
overexpression recovered BMP2 action. BMP2 stimulated ATF6 transcription by
enhancing the direct binding of Runx2 to the osteoblast-specific cis-acting
element 2 (OSE2, ACCACA, -205 to -200 bp) motif of the Atf6 promoter region. In
addition, the overexpression of ATF6 increased the Oc promoter activity by
enhancing the direct binding to a putative ATF6 binding motif (TGACGT, -1126 to
-1121 bp). The inhibition of ATF6 function with the dominant negative form of
ATF6 (DN-ATF6) blocked BMP2- or Runx2-induced OC expression. Interestingly,
OASIS, which is structurally similar to ATF6, did not induce Oc expression. ALP
and Alizarin red staining results confirmed that BMP2-induced matrix
mineralization was also dependent on ATF6 in vitro. Overall, these results
suggest that BMP2 induces osteoblast differentiation through Runx2-dependent ATF6
expression, which directly regulates Oc transcription.

A novel EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion transcript in a case of small cell osteosarcoma.

Cellular morphology of small cell osteosarcoma, an aggressive variant of
osteosarcoma, is similar to Ewing sarcoma, but its molecular pathogenesis is
largely unknown. We report the case of a 12-year-old girl with multifocal small
cell osteosarcoma positive for the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 (EWSR1) gene
rearrangement by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization and negative for
EWSR1-FLI1, EWSR1-ERG, and EWSR1-WT1 fusion transcripts by reverse transcriptase 
PCR. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends revealed exon 6 of the cAMP-responsive
element binding protein 3-like 1 gene (CREB3L1, also known as "OASIS,"
NM_52854.2) fused in-frame to the EWSR1 exon 11, consistent with the
EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion transcript expressed in tumor tissue. The corresponding
chimeric gene was confirmed by amplification and subsequent sequencing of the
genomic breakpoint between introns 11 and 5 of EWSR1 and CREB3L1, respectively.
An ~70 kDa product in the tumor tissue lysate reacted with the CREB3L1
carboxyterminal antibody, consistent with a 656-amino acid predicted chimeric
protein. Immunohistochemistry with the same antibody showed signal translocation 
from the physiologic perinuclear compartment observed in glia and unrelated
osteoblasts to nuclei of tumor cells, consistent with the likely function of
EWSR1-CREB3L1 as a transcriptional regulator predicted by its structure. This is 
the first report of a fusion transcript in osteogenic sarcoma; it demonstrates a 
relation between molecular mechanisms of small cell osteogenic and Ewing
sarcomas. The 3'-end partner and the inferred structure of EWSR1-CREB3L1,
however, are different from those of Ewing sarcoma, suggesting different targets 
of the new oncogene.

The membrane-bound transcription factor CREB3L1 is activated in response to virus
infection to inhibit proliferation of virus-infected cells.

Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.

CREB3L1/OASIS is a cellular transcription factor synthesized as a membrane-bound 
precursor and activated by regulated intramembrane proteolysis in response to
stimuli like ER stress. Comparing gene expression between Huh7 subclones that are
permissive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication versus the nonpermissive
parental Huh7 cells, we identified CREB3L1 as a host factor that inhibits
proliferation of virus-infected cells. Upon infection with diverse DNA and RNA
viruses, including murine <U+03B3>-herpesvirus 68, HCV, West Nile virus (WNV), and
Sendai virus, CREB3L1 was proteolytically cleaved, allowing its NH(2) terminus to
enter the nucleus and induce multiple genes encoding inhibitors of the cell cycle
to block cell proliferation. Consistent with this, we observed a necessity for
CREB3L1 expression to be silenced in proliferating cells that harbor replicons of
HCV or WNV. Our results indicate that CREB3L1 may play an important role in
limiting virus spread by inhibiting proliferation of virus-infected cells.

CREB3 subfamily transcription factors are not created equal: Recent insights from
global analyses and animal models.

The CREB3 subfamily of membrane-bound bZIP transcription factors has five members
in mammals known as CREB3 and CREB3L1-L4. One current model suggests that CREB3
subfamily transcription factors are similar to ATF6 in regulated intramembrane
proteolysis and transcriptional activation. Particularly, they were all thought
to be proteolytically activated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress 
to stimulate genes that are involved in unfolded protein response (UPR). Although
the physiological inducers of their proteolytic activation remain to be
identified, recent findings from microarray analyses, RNAi screens and gene
knockouts not only demonstrated their critical roles in regulating development,
metabolism, secretion, survival and tumorigenesis, but also revealed cell
type-specific patterns in the activation of their target genes. Members of the
CREB3 subfamily show differential activity despite their structural similarity.
The spectrum of their biological function expands beyond ER stress and UPR.
Further analyses are required to elucidate the mechanism of their proteolytic
activation and the molecular basis of their target recognition.

A new type of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress transducer, Old Astrocyte
Specifically Induced Substance (OASIS), which is induced by bone morphogenetic
protein-2 (BMP2), has been reported to activate the transcription of type I
collagen and contribute to the secretion of bone matrix proteins in osteoblasts. 
Here, we examined the role of OASIS in fracture healing using the fracture models
in wild-type (WT) and OASIS(-/-) mice. We found that the expression of OASIS mRNA
was induced after fracture. Micro-computed tomography indicated that the callus
density of OASIS(-/-) mice was less than that of WT mice, and the newly formed
bone in OASIS(-/-) mice exhibited a decrease of the bone volume by bone
morphometric analysis. Biomechanically, the callus bone strength of OASIS(-/-)
mice was inferior to that of WT mice. Based on RT-PCR, in situ hybridization,
immunohistochemical, and electrophoretic analyses, it was clarified that the
synthesis of type I collagen was impaired in OASIS(-/-) mice. Electron
microscopic analysis revealed that OASIS(-/-) osteoblasts in the fracture callus 
contained the abnormal expansion of the ERs, similar to OASIS(-/-) osteoblasts in
the normal skeletal development. Thus, OASIS may play a role in bone formation
through the expression of type I collagen and the secretion of bone matrix
proteins in fracture healing.

PURPOSE: Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) is typically characterized by the 
specific translocation t(7;16)(q33;p11) and the corresponding fusion gene
FUS-CREB3L2. The present study aimed to extract LGFMS-specific, and putatively
FUS-CREB3L2-dependent, gene expression patterns to learn more about the
pathogenesis of this tumor.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We carried out single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and
global gene expression array analyses, and/or immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses 
on 24 LGFMS tumor biopsies. Tumor types that are important differential diagnoses
to LGFMS were included as comparison in the gene and protein expression analyses.
In addition, cells that stably expressed FUS-CREB3L2 were analyzed with gene
expression array and the influence of FUS-CREB3L2 on gene expression was
investigated in vitro.
RESULTS: The SNP array analysis detected recurrent microdeletions in association 
with the t(7;16) chromosomal breakpoints and gain of 7q in cases with ring
chromosomes. Gene expression analysis clearly distinguished LGFMS from
morphologically similar tumors and MUC4 was identified as a potential diagnostic 
marker for LGFMS by gene expression and IHC analysis. FOXL1 was identified as the
top upregulated gene in LGFMS and CD24 was upregulated in both LGFMS tumors and
FUS-CREB3L2 expressing cells. FUS-CREB3L2 was capable of activating transcription
from CD24 regulatory sequences in luciferase assays, suggesting an important role
for the upregulation of this gene in LGFMS.
CONCLUSIONS: The gene expression profile of LGFMS is distinct from that of soft
tissue tumors with similar morphology. The data could be used to identify a
potential diagnostic marker for LGFMS and to identify possible FUS-CREB3L2
regulated genes.

Eukaryotic cells can adapt to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction by producing
diverse signals from the ER to the cytosol or nucleus. These signalling pathways 
are collectively known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). The canonical
branches of the UPR are mediated by three ER membrane-bound proteins: PERK, IRE1 
and ATF6. These ER stress transducers basically play important roles in cell
survival after ER stress. Recently, novel types of ER stress transducers that
share a region of high sequence similarity with ATF6 have been identified. They
have a transmembrane domain, which allows them to associate with the ER, and
possess a transcription-activation domain and a bZIP domain. These membrane-bound
bZIP transcription factors include Luman, OASIS, BBF2H7, CREBH and CREB4. Despite
their structural similarities with ATF6, differences in activating stimuli,
tissue distribution and response element binding indicate specialized functions
of each member on regulating the UPR in specific organs and tissues. Here, we
summarize our current understanding of the biochemical characteristics and
physiological functions of the ER-resident bZIP transcription factors.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays role in the maintenance of numerous aspects 
of cellular and organismal homeostasis by folding, modifying, and exporting
nascent secretory and transmembrane proteins. Failure of the ER's adaptive
capacity results in accumulation of unfolded or malfolded proteins in the ER
lumen (ER stress). To avoid cellular damage, mammalian cells activate the
specific signals from the ER to the cytosol or nucleus to enhance the capacity
for protein folding, attenuate the synthesis of proteins, and degrade unfolded
proteins. These signaling pathways are collectively known as the unfolded protein
response (UPR). The canonical branches of the UPR are mediated by three ER
membrane-bound proteins, PERK, IRE1, and ATF6. These ER stress transducers
basically play important roles in cell survival after ER stress. Recently, novel 
types of ER stress transducers, OASIS family members that share a region of high 
sequence similarity with ATF6 have been identified. They have a transmembrane
domain, which allows them to associate with the ER, and possess a
transcription-activation domain and a bZIP domain. OASIS family proteins include 
OASIS, BBF2H7, CREBH, AIbZIP, and Luman. Despite the structural similarities
among OASIS family proteins and ATF6, differences in activating stimuli, tissue
distribution, and response element binding indicate specialized functions of each
member on regulating the UPR in the specific organs and tissues. Here, we
summarize our current understanding of biochemical characteristics and in vivo
functions of OASIS family proteins, particularly focusing on OASIS and BBF2H7. A 
growing body of new works suggests that the UPR branches regulated by OASIS
family members play essential roles in cell differentiation and maturation or
maintenance of basal cellular homeostasis in mammals.

An expression profile analysis of ES cell-derived definitive endodermal cells and
Pdx1-expressing cells.

Genetics, Kumamoto University, Honjo 2-2-1, Kumamoto, Japan.

BACKGROUND: We developed an efficient in vitro method to differentiate mouse ES
cells into the definitive endoderm (DE) and then Pdx1-expressing pancreatic
lineages using mesodermal-derived supporting cells, M15. Using this method,
resulting ES cell-derived DE and Pdx1-expressing cells were isolated by cell
sorting, and their gene expression profiles were investigated with DNA
microarray. Genes that were specifically expressed in DE and/or in
Pdx1-expressing cells were extracted and their expression patterns in normal
embryonic development were studied.
RESULTS: Genes whose expression increased in DE and Pdx1 positive cells compared 
to the undifferentiated ES cells were chosen and in situ hybridizations were
performed. Out of 54 genes examined, 27 were expressed in the DE of E8.5 mouse
embryos and 15 genes were expressed in distinct domains in the pancreatic buds of
E14.5 embryos. Among those genes expressed were Foxq1, CpM, Foxp4, Pcdh1, and
Zmiz1, which were previously reported in other endodermal tissues. Genes, such as
Parm1, Tmem184a, Hipk2 and Sox4 were reported to be expressed during early
pancreatic development. Nptx2, C2cd4b, Tcf7l2 and Kiss1r were reported to be
associated with beta cell or pancreatic functions in the adult. Akr1c19, Aebp2,
Pbxip1 and Creb3l1, were novel and have not been described as being expressed
either in DE or the pancreas.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified 27 genes, including 4 novel genes expressed in DE and 
pancreatic progenitor cells during normal development using an ES cell in vitro
differentiation system. These results showed that DE cells and
Pdx1/GFP-expressing cells obtained from our M15 based differentiation method
mimic cells during the normal developmental processes. Additionally, ES cells are
an excellent model for studies of early developmental processes.

Old astrocyte specifically induced substance (OASIS), which is a new type of
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress transducer, is a basic leucine zipper
transcription factor of the CREB/ATF family that contains a transmembrane domain 
and is processed by regulated intramembrane proteolysis in response to ER stress.
OASIS is selectively expressed in certain types of cells such as astrocytes and
osteoblasts. We have previously demonstrated that OASIS activates transcription
of the type I collagen gene Col1a1 and contributes to the secretion of bone
matrix proteins in osteoblasts, and that OASIS-/- mice exhibit osteopenia and
growth retardation. In the present study, we examined whether osteopenia in
OASIS-/- mice is rescued by OASIS introduction into osteoblasts. We generated
OASIS-/- mice that specifically expressed OASIS in osteoblasts using a 2.3-kb
osteoblast-specific type I collagen promoter (OASIS-/-;Tg mice). Histological
analysis of OASIS-/-;Tg mice revealed that osteopenia in OASIS-/- mice was
rescued by osteoblast-specific expression of the OASIS transgene. The decreased
expression levels of type I collagen mRNAs in the bone tissues of OASIS-/- mice
were recovered by the OASIS transgene accompanied by the rescue of an abnormal
expansion of the rough ER in OASIS-/- osteoblasts. In contrast, growth
retardation in OASIS-/- mice did not improve in OASIS-/-;Tg mice. Interestingly, 
the serum levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1
were downregulated in OASIS-/- mice compared with those in wild-type mice. These 
decreased GH and IGF-1 levels in OASIS-/- mice did not change when OASIS was
introduced into osteoblasts. Taken together, these results indicate that OASIS
regulates skeletal development by osteoblast-dependent and -independent
mechanisms.

The CrebA/Creb3-like transcription factors are major and direct regulators of
secretory capacity.

Fox RM(1), Hanlon CD, Andrew DJ.

Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.

Secretion occurs in all cells, with relatively low levels in most cells and
extremely high levels in specialized secretory cells, such as those of the
pancreas, salivary, and mammary glands. How secretory capacity is selectively
up-regulated in specialized secretory cells is unknown. Here, we find that the
CrebA/Creb3-like family of bZip transcription factors functions to up-regulate
expression of both the general protein machinery required in all cells for
secretion and of cell type-specific secreted proteins. Drosophila CrebA directly 
binds the enhancers of secretory pathway genes and is both necessary and
sufficient to activate expression of every secretory pathway component gene
examined thus far. Microarray profiling reveals that CrebA also up-regulates
expression of genes encoding cell type-specific secreted components. Finally, we 
found that the human CrebA orthologues, Creb3L1 and Creb3L2, have the ability to 
up-regulate the secretory pathway in nonsecretory cell types.

Old astrocyte specifically induced substance (OASIS) has previously been shown to
be a putative endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor in astrocytes with a
mechanism of activation that is similar to ATF6. In this study we investigated
the expression and activation of endogenous and overexpressed OASIS in pancreatic
beta-cells. OASIS mRNA expression was detected in pancreatic beta-cell lines and 
rodent islets, and the expression level was up-regulated by ER stress-inducing
compounds. Endogenous OASIS protein, however, is expressed at low levels in
pancreatic beta-cell lines and rodent islets, possibly due to abundant levels of 
the micro-RNA miR-140 present in these cells. In contrast, expression of both
full-length and cleaved (active) OASIS was readily detectable in the developing
mouse pancreas (embryonic d 15.5). Microarray analysis after expression of an
active nuclear-localized version of OASIS in an inducible INS-1 beta-cell line
resulted in the up-regulation of many genes implicated in extracellular matrix
production and protein transport but not classical ER stress response genes.
Consistent with this, expression of active OASIS failed to induce
glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa promoter activity in pancreatic beta-cells.
These results suggest that the repertoire of genes induced by OASIS is cell
type-dependent and that the OASIS protein may have a role in pancreas
development.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been reported to be linked to various
diseases such as diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and osteogenesis
imperfecta (OI). Old astrocyte specifically induced substance (OASIS), a novel
type of ER stress transducer, is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor
belonging to the CREB/ATF family and is markedly expressed in osteoblasts.
Recently, we demonstrated that OASIS activates the transcription of the gene for 
type I collagen, Col1a1, and contributes to the secretion of bone matrix proteins
in osteoblasts. OASIS-/- mice exhibit severe osteopenia involving a decrease in
type I collagen in the bone matrix and a dysfunction of osteoblasts, which show
abnormal expansion of the rough ER. These phenotypic features of osteopenia are
similar to those observed in OI type I. In this study, we investigated whether
administration of the third-generation bisphosphonate risedronate (RIS) is
effective for treating osteopenia in OASIS-/- mice. Histological and
histomorphometric analyses revealed that the trabecular bones increased
dramatically in OASIS-/- mice treated with RIS, owing to the inhibition of bone
resorption. Intriguingly, the abnormal expansion of the rough ER in OASIS-/-
osteoblasts was improved by the treatment with RIS. Taken together, we conclude
that OASIS-/- mice will be useful as new model mice for evaluating the medicinal 
effects of osteopenia treatments and developing new drugs for the osteopenia
associated with diseases such as OI and osteoporosis.

Eukaryotic cells have signalling pathways from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to 
cytosol and nuclei, to avoid excess accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. 
We previously identified a new type of ER stress transducer, OASIS, a bZIP (basic
leucine zipper) transcription factor, which is a member of the CREB/ATF family
and has a transmembrane domain. OASIS is processed by regulated intramembrane
proteolysis (RIP) in response to ER stress, and is highly expressed in
osteoblasts. OASIS(-/-) mice exhibited severe osteopenia, involving a decrease in
type I collagen in the bone matrix and a decline in the activity of osteoblasts, 
which showed abnormally expanded rough ER, containing of a large amount of bone
matrix proteins. Here we identify the gene for type 1 collagen, Col1a1, as a
target of OASIS, and demonstrate that OASIS activates the transcription of Col1a1
through an unfolded protein response element (UPRE)-like sequence in the
osteoblast-specific Col1a1 promoter region. Moreover, expression of OASIS in
osteoblasts is induced by BMP2 (bone morphogenetic protein 2), the signalling of 
which is required for bone formation. Additionally, RIP of OASIS is accelerated
by BMP2 signalling, which causes mild ER stress. Our studies show that OASIS is
critical for bone formation through the transcription of Col1a1 and the secretion
of bone matrix proteins, and they reveal a new mechanism by which ER
stress-induced signalling mediates bone formation.

Apolipoprotein E4 domain interaction induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and
impairs astrocyte function.

Domain interaction, a structural property of apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4), is
predicted to contribute to the association of apoE4 with Alzheimer disease.
Arg-61 apoE mice, a gene-targeted mouse model specific for domain interaction,
have lower brain apoE levels and synaptic, functional, and cognitive deficits. We
hypothesized that domain interaction elicits an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
in astrocytes and an unfolded protein response that targets Arg-61 apoE for
degradation. Primary Arg-61 apoE astrocytes had less intracellular apoE than
wild-type astrocytes, and unfolded protein response markers OASIS (old astrocyte 
specifically induced substance), ATF4, and XBP-1 and downstream effectors were
up-regulated. ER stress appears to cause global astrocyte dysfunction as glucose 
uptake was decreased in Arg-61 apoE astrocytes, and astrocyte-conditioned medium 
promoted neurite outgrowth less efficiently than wild-type medium in Neuro-2a
cell cultures. We showed age-dependent up-regulation of brain OASIS levels and
processing in Arg-61 apoE mice. ER stress and astrocyte dysfunction represent a
new paradigm underlying the association of apoE4 with neurodegeneration.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response is a defense system for dealing
with the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen. Old astrocyte
specifically induced substance (OASIS) is known to be expressed in astrocytes and
involved in the ER stress response; however the function of OASIS in the injured 
brain has remained unclear. In this study, we examined the roles of OASIS in
neuronal degeneration in the hippocampi of mice intraperitoneally injected with
kainic acid (KA). OASIS mRNA was strongly induced in response to KA injection,
with a similar time course to the induction of ER molecular chaperone
immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein mRNA. In situ hybridization showed
that KA injection causes induction of immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein 
mRNA in glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes as well as in
pyramidal neurons, although up-regulation of OASIS mRNA was only detected in
glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes. Primary cultured astrocytes,
but not the neurons of OASIS-/- mice, revealed reduced vulnerability to ER
stress. Furthermore, pyramidal neurons in the hippocampi of OASIS-/- mice were
more susceptible to the toxicity induced by KA than those of wild-type mice.
Taken together, these data suggest that OASIS expressed in astrocytes plays
important roles in protection against the neuronal damage induced by KA.

Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma with recurrent and low
metastatic potential, which has characteristic FUS-CREB3L2 or FUS-CREB3L1
fusions. Perineurioma is a peripheral nerve sheath neoplasm, which is usually
benign. Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma and perineurioma can appear morphologically
similar, particularly in small biopsy specimens, and distinction between the 2
entities is important for appropriate treatment. Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma is
negative for most immunohistochemical markers, whereas perineuriomas stain
variably for epithelial membrane antigen, CD34 and claudin-1, a tight-junction
associated protein. We studied 15 cases of genetically proven low-grade
fibromyxoid sarcoma that at least focally resembled perineurioma, with antibodies
to claudin-1 and epithelial membrane antigen. Of these, 11 showed positivity for 
epithelial membrane antigen and all 15 were positive for claudin-1; in all cases,
expression of claudin-1 was equal to or greater than the corresponding epithelial
membrane antigen expression. This study emphasizes that claudin-1 is
significantly expressed in low-grade fibromyxoid sarcomas. This has implications 
toward the accurate diagnosis of both tumors, and, as positivity for claudin-1 in
low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma is not previously documented, suggests that there
might be underdiagnosis of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma. Although positivity for
claudin-1 remains useful as an adjunct marker for perineurioma, it should be
taken in context with clinical findings, morphology, and the additional
immunoprofile.

Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma is difficult to diagnose by fine needle aspiration 
cytology: a cytomorphological study of eight cases.

BACKGROUND: Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) is an uncommon neoplasm with
bland morphology and an indolent clinical course, although metastases may develop
in approximately 5-10% of the cases. The diagnosis of LGFMS can be difficult to
render from fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) alone because of morphological
overlap with other spindle cell and myxoid lesions.
OBJECTIVE: To determine cytological criteria for LGFMS by reviewing FNAC
aspirates in eight cases and to compare the findings with those in subsequent
histological sections.
METHODS: FNAC slides were reviewed from eight patients with subsequently excised 
tumours diagnosed as LGFMS. Of these patients, six also had core needle biopsies 
(CNB). Cytogenetic and/or molecular analysis was carried on all tumours.
RESULTS: The patients were six men and two women ranging in age from 26 to 78
years. Tumours arose in the deep soft tissues of the thigh (n = 5), shoulder
girdle (n = 1) or upper arm (n = 1) and one in the subcutaneous tissue of the
abdominal wall. Cytological features included clusters of bland spindle and
round/polygonal cells embedded in a collagenous and myxoid matrix along with
dissociated, uniform or slightly/moderately pleomorphic spindle cells, bare
nuclei and fragments of collagen and myxoid tissue in varying proportions.
Unequivocal sarcoma was diagnosed in two aspirates, but mitoses were absent in
all cases. In three cases, the diagnosis was inconclusive with regard to
benignity or malignancy, while three were erroneously diagnosed as benign spindle
cell lesions. Although the diagnosis was suggested on three of six CNB, these
presented similar diagnostic problems.
CONCLUSIONS: There were no cytomorphological findings in FNAC to allow for a
clear cut separation of LGFMS from other spindle cell or myxoid lesions, but
high-grade sarcoma could be excluded. Surgical (incisional or excisional) biopsy 
or, alternatively, examination of RT-PCR for the FUS/CREB3L or FUS/CREB3L1 fusion
transcripts may be necessary to obtain a correct diagnosis.

One of the master regulators of placental cell fusion in mammals leading to
multi-nucleated syncytiotrophoblasts is the transcription factor GCMa. Recently, 
we proved that the cAMP-driven protein kinase A signaling pathway is fundamental 
for up-regulation of GCMa transcript levels and protein stability. Here, we show 
that Transducer of Regulated CREB activity (TORC1), the human co-activator of
cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), but not a dominant-negative CREB
mutant, significantly up-regulates the GCMa promoter. We identified potential
cAMP response element (CRE)-binding sites within the GCMa promoter upstream of
the transcriptional start site. Only the CRE site at -1337 interacted strongly
with CREB in promoter mapping experiments. The characterization of GCMa promoter 
mutants and additional bZIP-type family members demonstrated that also old
astrocyte specifically-induced substance (OASIS) is able to stimulate GCMa
transcription. Knockdown of endogenous CREB or OASIS in BeWo cells decreased
endogenous GCMa mRNA level and activity. Overexpression of TORC1 or OASIS in
choriocarcinoma cells led to placental cell fusion, accompanied by placental
expression of gap junction forming protein connexin-43. Further, we show that
CREB expression is replaced by OASIS expression around E12.5 suggesting that a
sequential order of bZIP-type family members ensures a high rate of GCMa
transcription throughout placentation.

Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcomas (LGFMS) bear either the t(7,16) (q32-34;p11) or
t(11,16) (p11;p11) translocations, resulting in FUS-CREB3L2 or FUS-CREB3L1
fusions, respectively. Heretofore, fusion transcripts were mainly detected in
frozen tissues, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In this
study, we aimed to develop a reliable method to detect these in paraffin-embedded
tissues, and to examine the clinicopathologic characteristics of a series of
translocation-positive LGFMS. Sixty-three neoplasms with typical morphologic
features of LGFMS and 66 non-LGFMS tumors selected for their resemblance to LGFMS
(LGFMS-like tumors) were examined. RNA of sufficient quality could be extracted
from 111/129 (86%) cases (59 LGFMS, 52 non-LGFMS). Of all, 48/59 (sensitivity,
81%) LGFMS contained detectable transcripts (45 FUS-CREB3L2, 3 FUS-CREB3L1). Most
relevant clinicopathologic features of fusion-positive LGFMS included
predominance in lower extremities (22/48; thigh: 13/48), deep situation (46/48), 
and occasional presence of unusual histologic features, for example,
hypercellular areas (16/48), foci of epithelioid cells (13/48), and giant
rosettes (6/48). Most tumors expressed EMA (41/45), at least focally, CD99

(1/41), smooth muscle actin (1/45), S100 protein (0/46), desmin (0/44),
h-caldesmon (0/42), keratins (0/44), and CD117 (0/40). Eleven presumed LGFMS were
fusion negative. Of all, 7/52 non-LGMFS neoplasms contained FUS-CREB3L2
transcripts, of which 4 had been diagnosed as sclerosing epithelioid
fibrosarcoma. In conclusion, FUS-CREB3L1/L2 fusion transcripts can be detected in
paraffin-embedded LGFMS in a sensitive manner, using reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Most fusion-positive LGFMS are
EMA-positive and CD34/S100/smooth muscle actin negative. The presence of
epithelioid cells and fusion transcripts in both LGFMS and a subset of sclerosing
epithelioid fibrosarcoma suggest that these neoplasms might be related.

The human endogenous retrovirus envelope glycoprotein, syncytin-1, regulates
neuroinflammation and its receptor expression in multiple sclerosis: a role for
endoplasmic reticulum chaperones in astrocytes.

Retroviral envelopes are pathogenic glycoproteins which cause neuroinflammation, 
neurodegeneration, and endoplasmic reticulum stress responses. The human
endogenous retrovirus (HERV-W) envelope protein, Syncytin-1, is highly expressed 
in CNS glia of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). In this study, we
investigated the mechanisms by which Syncytin-1 mediated neuroimmune activation
and oligodendrocytes damage. In brain tissue from individuals with MS, ASCT1, a
receptor for Syncytin-1 and a neutral amino acid transporter, was selectively
suppressed in astrocytes (p < 0.05). Syncytin-1 induced the expression of the
endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor, old astrocyte specifically induced substance
(OASIS), in cultured astrocytes, similar to findings in MS brains. Overexpression
of OASIS in astrocytes increased inducible NO synthase expression but
concurrently down-regulated ASCT1 (p < 0.01). Treatment of astrocytes with a NO
donor enhanced expression of early growth response 1, with an ensuing reduction
in ASCT1 expression (p < 0.05). Small-interfering RNA molecules targeting
Syncytin-1 selectively down-regulated its expression, preventing the suppression 
of ASCT1 and the release of oligodendrocyte cytotoxins by astrocytes. A
Syncytin-1-transgenic mouse expressing Syncytin-1 under the glial fibrillary
acidic protein promoter demonstrated neuroinflammation, ASCT1 suppression, and
diminished levels of myelin proteins in the corpus callosum, consistent with
observations in CNS tissues from MS patients together with neurobehavioral
abnormalities compared with wild-type littermates (p < 0.05). Thus, Syncytin-1
initiated an OASIS-mediated suppression of ASCT1 in astrocytes through the
induction of inducible NO synthase with ensuing oligodendrocyte injury. These
studies provide new insights into the role of HERV-mediated neuroinflammation and
its contribution to an autoimmune disease.

Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.

Secretory and transmembrane proteins are correctly folded or processed in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Various stresses disturb ER function and provoke the 
accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen. This condition is termed ER
stress. Recently, ER stress has been linked to neuronal death in various
neurodegenerative diseases. Among the cell populations in the nervous system,
which comprises heterogeneous cell types including neuronal and glial cells,
astrocytes have the unique ability of being able to tolerate and even proliferate
under ischemic and hypoxic conditions that lead to ER stress. This review
introduces a novel ER stress transducer, old astrocyte specifically induced
substance (OASIS), that regulates the signaling of the unfolded protein response 
specifically in astrocytes and contributes to resistance to ER stress. In
addition, current information is summarized regarding new types of ER stress
transducers homologous to OASIS that are involved in cell type-specific ER stress
responses.

Hyalinizing spindle cell tumor with giant rosettes arising in the lung: report of
a case with FUS-CREB3L2 fusion transcripts.

Hyalinizing spindle cell tumor with giant rosettes (HSCT) is a very uncommon
mesenchymal tumor that has similar morphological and biological features to the
low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS). Lung involvement of HSCT is extremely
rare, and only one case has been reported in the English-language literature.
Reported herein is a case of primary pulmonary HSCT that had FUS-CREB3L2 fusion
transcripts, a product of characteristic chromosomal abnormality t(7;16)(q33;p11)
of HSCT and LGFMS. The patient was a 50-year-old woman who had a large solitary
mass in the lung. Histologically, it was composed of bland spindle cells with
variable cellularity deposited in a densely hyalinized stroma alternating with
myxoid areas. Characteristic collagen rosettes were scattered in the cellular
areas. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay using
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue detected FUS-CREB3L2 fusion transcripts.
Despite its bland morphology, it is known as low-grade sarcoma and its
recognition in the lung would be helpful for accurate diagnosis and proper
management of this rare tumor. RT-PCR for detection of FUS-CREB3L2 fusion
transcripts is a useful method for differential diagnosis of primary pulmonary
HSCT.

CREB3L2 was first identified as the 3'-partner of FUS in a fusion gene that seems
to be specific for low grade fibromyxoid sarcoma. In silico analyses suggest that
the predicted CREB3L2 protein is a member of the CREB3 family of transcription
factors, with its bZIP domain being highly similar to that in CREB3L1, CREB3L3,
CREB3L4, CREB3, and Drosophila Bbf-2. In the present study, the authors assessed 
various cellular outcomes after transfection of NIH3T3 and HEK-293 cells with
constructs containing full-length and truncated versions of CREB3L2 and
FUS/CREB3L2. Northern blot of CREB3L2 mRNA revealed a 7.4 kbp band that contains 
0.4 kbp and 5.5 kbp untranslated 5' and 3' regions, respectively. CREB3L2
constructs containing the first 120 amino acids (aa) showed the highest
transcriptional activation. Much stronger transcriptional activation was
consistently seen for the FUS/CREB3L2 constructs than for the corresponding
CREB3L2 constructs. Transcriptional activity was achieved through the box-B
element, ATF6 and CRE binding sites, as well as the GRP78 promoter. Proteins
encoded by full-length CREB3L2 and FUS/CREB3L2 were localized to reticular
structures of the cytoplasm, whereas the corresponding, truncated proteins
lacking the transmembrane domain and the carboxy-terminal part of CREB3L2 resided
within the nucleus. The results of the present study show that CREB3L2 is not
only structurally, but also functionally very similar to CREB3L1. Thus, studies
regarding the pathways influenced by wild-type CREB3L2 should provide valuable
clues to the pathogenetic significance of the FUS/CREB3L2 chimera in low grade
fibromyxoid sarcoma.

A diagnosis of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) remains problematic because 
of its bland-looking histologic features that can be potentially confused with
other benign or low-grade fibromyxoid lesions. Recent cytogenetic and molecular
analyses have shown that most LGFMSs have a characteristic chromosomal
abnormality, t(7;16)(q33;p11), resulting in the FUS-CREB3L2 fusion gene. However,
such assays have only rarely been used to analyze formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tumor samples. In the present study, we conducted a reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay to detect the FUS-CREB3L2 fusion
transcripts using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue specimens from
16 LGFMSs including 3 cases with giant collagen rosettes. The primers were newly 
designed to specifically amplify most of the junctional regions of the
FUS-CREB3L2 fusion gene transcripts previously reported. The FUS-CREB3L2 fusion
gene transcripts were detected in 14/16 (88%) cases of LGFMS. A nucleotide
sequence analysis of the PCR products revealed that different portions of the FUS
exon 6 or 7 were fused with various sites of the CREB3L2 exon 5, resulting in 12 
different nucleotide sequences. We also tested a primer set to detect the
FUS-CREB3L1 fusion transcript, which is a rare variant of the gene fusion in
LGFMS, although no PCR products were identified in any case. The FUS-CREB3L2
fusion transcripts were not detected in any of the 123 other soft-tissue tumors, 
including desmoid-type fibromatoses, myxofibrosarcomas, soft-tissue
perineuriomas, and congenital or adult fibrosarcomas. These data suggest that our
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay is a reliable method to
detect FUS-CREB3L2, which can thus help in accurately diagnosing LGFMS.

endoplasmic reticulum stress.

When unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
unfolded protein response (UPR) signals are transmitted from the ER to the
nucleus and cytoplasm to facilitate protein folding. OASIS (old astrocyte
specifically induced substance) is an ER stress transducer in astrocytes, a
membrane-bound transcription factor that activates genes in the ER stress
response. When unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, OASIS is cleaved at the
membrane to release its cytoplasmic domain, which then enters the nucleus and
activates target genes. Here, we showed that OASIS is processed by Site-1 and -2 
proteases (S1P and S2P), enzymes that reside at the Golgi apparatus and process
activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), in response to ER stress. We also
showed that the cleavage of OASIS is triggered by its translocation to the Golgi 
apparatus. All deletion mutants for luminal domain of OASIS showed that
proteolytic processing and translocation to the Golgi apparatus remained intact, 
indicating that OASIS does not have significant sequences for Golgi localization 
signals, different from the case of ATF6, and that there could be other systems
for translocation of OASIS to the Golgi apparatus in response to ER stress.

Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) is a rare tumor. Reported herein is a case 
of LGFMS arising in the big toe. The patient was a 58-year-old man who underwent 
excision of the tumor. The tumor was well-demarcated. Histologically, there were 
proliferating spindle-shaped tumor cells arranged in a whorled growth pattern,
and the stroma showed hyalinized collagen bundles and a myxoid matrix. Nuclear
mitotic figures were conspicuous in part. A large rosette-like structure with
hyalinized stroma was found, which is characteristic of LGFMS. The differential
diagnosis included tumor occurrence in adults; tending to arise in distal
extremities; and having bland fibromyxoid histological features, such as fibroma 
of tendon sheath, low-grade myxofibrosarcoma and acral myxoinflammatory
fibroblastic sarcoma. It was not possible to detect the FUS/CREB3L2 and
FUS/CREB3L1 fusion genes from the formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue,
although the histological features of the present case were typical of LGFMS.
LGFMS may become more common with time, and unique cases may accumulate.

Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) is an indolent, late-metastasizing
malignant soft-tissue tumor that is often mistaken for either more benign or more
malignant tumor types. Cytogenetic analyses have identified a recurrent balanced 
translocation t(7;16) (q32-34;p11), later shown by molecular genetic approaches
to result in a FUS/CREB3L2 fusion gene. Whereas preliminary studies suggest that 
this gene rearrangement is specific for LGFMS, its incidence in this tumor type
and the possible existence of variant fusion genes have not yet been addressed.
For this purpose, a series of potential LGFMS were obtained from nine different
soft-tissue tumor centres and subjected to molecular analysis as well as careful 
histopathologic review. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis 
disclosed a FUS/CREB3L2 fusion transcript in 22 of the 23 (96%) cases that
remained classified as LGFMS after the histologic re-evaluation and from which
RNA of sufficient quality could be extracted, whereas none of the cases that were
classified as other tumor types was fusion-positive. In one of the tumors with
typical LGFMS appearance, we found that FUS was fused to the CREB3L1 gene instead
of CREB3L2. The proteins encoded by these genes both belong to the same basic
leucine-zipper family of transcription factors, and display extensive sequence
homology in their DNA-binding domains. Thus, it is expected that the novel
FUS/CREB3L1 chimera will have a similar impact at the cellular level as the much 
more common FUS/CREB3L2 fusion protein. Taken together, the results indicate that
virtually all LGFMS are characterized by a chimeric FUS/CREB3L2 gene, and that
rare cases may display a variant FUS/CREB3L1 fusion.

The transcription factor OASIS gene, which encodes for a CREB/ATF family member, 
is specifically expressed in the salivary gland, the cartilage and the tooth
germs of the mouse embryo. In the present study, the expression patterns were
compared between OASIS mRNA and major vertebrate proteoglycans, which might be
the downstream genes of OASIS in the tooth germs of mouse first mandibular
molars, through in situ hybridization histochemistry. OASIS mRNA expression was
observed in the inner enamel epithelium during the cap and bell stages
(E14.5-E18.5) in the preodontoblasts during differentiation stage (E18.5-P0) and 
in the differentiating odontoblasts during the early secretory stage (P2.5-P4.5).
Proteoglycans (versican, decorin, biglycan, glypican, syndecan-1, and syndecan-3)
were expressed in the tooth germs in various patterns. Decorin, biglycan,
syndecan-1 and syndecan-3 showed gene expressions overlapping with OASIS.
Especially the expression pattern of decorin and syndecan-3 coincided temporally 
and spatially exactly with that of OASIS. These results suggest that the OASIS
gene might be related to proteoglycan expression and may play an important role
in the differentiation of the odontoblast and cells in inner enamel epithelium.

We reported the expression patterns of a novel member of the CREB/ATF family,
OASIS, in central nervous system (CNS) lesions and its transcriptional activity. 
OASIS gene expression was upregulated in the stab-injured spinal cord. Double
labeling experiments revealed that the distribution of OASIS mRNA-positive cells 
overlapped with a population of GFAP-immunoreactive cells. This finding suggested
that OASIS might regulate expression of important downstream molecules in certain
subset of the reactive astrocytes (e.g. inhibitory substances in injured brain). 
In gel shift assays, OASIS was able to specifically bind to CRE as CREB family
members were. We then examined transcriptional activity of full-length OASIS with
GAL4-UAS-luciferase reporter assay in COS7 cells. OASIS protein activated
transcription, but did not inhibit basal transcription driven by AdML promoter.
To determine critical portion(s) of the OASIS protein in transcriptional
activation, we examined the activity of various deletion constructs of OASIS
gene. The assay revealed that a strong transcriptional activation domain lay in
the N-terminal region where acidic amino acids clustered and a possible
repression domain, which had not been reported for other CREB/ATF family members,
lay in the more C-terminal region. We therefore proposed that OASIS protein
positively regulated gene transcription in a subset of reactive astrocytes, and
thereby influenced the reaction of injured CNS tissues.

Murine OASIS is a putative CREB/ATF family transcription factor that is induced
in gliosis, but its molecular role has not been determined. We have isolated the 
human OASIS gene and investigated the potential of OASIS protein as a
transcriptional activator. We found that OASIS can activate transcription through
box-B elements but not through the somatostatin CRE. OASIS contains a putative
C-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane domain, a typical structural feature for the
transcription factors activated by regulated intramembrane proteolysis.
Truncation of the OASIS transmembrane domain resulted in a significant increase
in transcriptional activity and altered its subcellular localization from the
endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleus. Western blot analysis of transfected cells 
identified OASIS polypeptides of 82 and 66 kDa. These results suggest that the
transmembrane domain plays an important role in the regulation of transcriptional
activation by OASIS.

The OASIS gene, which encodes a novel CREB/ATF family member, was isolated from
long-term cultured astrocytes that were employed as an in vitro gliosis model. In
the present study, we examined the expression pattern of the OASIS gene in the
developing mouse embryo by in situ hybridization histochemistry and compared it
with the expression of osteogenesis markers. OASIS mRNA expression was most
strongly detected in preosteoblasts of the outer bony cortex of the ribs.
Alveolar bone also showed strong signals for OASIS gene expression. OASIS mRNA
was also localized to the preodontoblast of tooth buds. Expression began at
embryonic day 12 (D12.5), peaked around D14.5-16.5, and continued to D18.5. The
pattern of expression was very similar to that of hXBP-1 mRNA, which encodes
another CREB/ATF family member. Spatiotemporal patterns of OASIS partly
overlapped that of osteopontin, osteonectin, and alpha1 type I procollagen genes.
Among these, the time course of OASIS mRNA expression was most similar to that of
osteopontin mRNA expression, suggesting that the OASIS protein is involved in the
late phase of osteoblast differentiation, as compared to the Cbfa1 that regulates
early phases of osteoblast differentiation.

Gliosis is a characteristic response of astrocytes to inflammation and trauma of 
the central nervous system (CNS). To study the mechanisms underlying gliosis, we 
performed differential display screening for genes specifically induced in
long-term cultured astrocytes used as an in vitro gliosis model. We identified
and characterized a gene (named OASIS, for old astrocyte specifically-induced
substance) expressed in long-term cultured mouse astrocytes, or 'old astrocytes
(OA)'. The OASIS gene encoded a putative transcription factor belonging to the
cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein/activating transcription factor
(CREB/ATF) gene family, with homology to box B-binding factor-2 (BBF-2), a
Drosophila transcription factor. Its expression was developmentally regulated;
OASIS mRNA was primarily expressed in the salivary gland and cartilage in the
mouse embryo and it was transiently upregulated in the brain during postnatal two
weeks. The expression became weaker in the adult brain. We also demonstrated that
an expression of the OASIS mRNA was induced in response to the cryo-injury of the
mouse cerebral cortex. The distribution pattern of the OASIS-positive cells in
the injured cortex was very similar to that of the glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP)-positive cells. These results suggest that OASIS protein may play 
a role in gliotic events.
