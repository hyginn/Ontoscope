The developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis states that adverse
early life exposures can have lasting, detrimental effects on lifelong health.
Exposure to maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy is associated with
morbidity and mortality in offspring, including increased risks for miscarriage, 
stillbirth, low birth weight, preterm birth, asthma, obesity, altered
neurobehavior, and other conditions. Maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy 
interferes with placental growth and functioning, and it has been proposed that
this may occur through the disruption of normal and necessary placental
epigenetic patterns. Epigenome-wide association studies have identified a number 
of differentially methylated placental genes that are associated with maternal
smoking during pregnancy, including RUNX3, PURA, GTF2H2, GCA, GPR135, and HKR1.
The placental methylation status of RUNX3 and NR3C1 has also been linked to
adverse infant outcomes, including preterm birth and low birth weight,
respectively. Candidate gene analyses have also found maternal smoking-associated
placental methylation differences in the NR3C1, CYP1A1, HTR2A, and HSD11B2 genes,
as well as in the repetitive elements LINE-1 and AluYb8. The differential
methylation patterns of several genes have been confirmed to also exhibit altered
gene expression patterns, including CYP1A1, CYP19A1, NR3C1, and HTR2A. Placental 
methylation patterns associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy may be
largely gene-specific and tissue-specific and, to a lesser degree, involve global
changes. It is important for future research to investigate the mechanistic roles
that these differentially methylated genes may play in mediating the association 
between maternal smoking during pregnancy and disease in later life, as well as
to elucidate the potential influence of emerging tobacco product use during
pregnancy, including the use of electronic cigarettes, on placental epigenetics.

Chromosomal loci with genomic imbalances are frequently identified in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Greater than two-thirds of hepatitis B virus
(HBV)-related HCCs originate from liver cirrhosis following a duration of up to
two decades. However, it is unclear whether these genomic imbalances occur and
accumulate in dysplastic hepatocytes of the cirrhotic liver during the
progression from regenerated nodules to preneoplastic lesions, including
dysplastic nodules (DN). In the present study, high-grade DNs (HGDNs) of
HBV-related liver cirrhosis were screened to identify loci with genomic
imbalances, and the frequency of the identified loci in a group of HCCs was
analyzed in order to determine whether there may be a genetic link between liver 
cirrhosis and HCC. Genomic DNA was extracted from six HGDNs of two cases of
HBV-related liver cirrhosis and subjected to array comparative genomic
hybridization (CGH) analysis with a NimbleGen 720K microarray. Loci with the most
frequently observed genomic imbalances in DNs were further analyzed in 83 cases
of HCC by differential polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative PCR. The 
array CGH analysis revealed that the majority of genomic imbalances in the HGDNs 
were genomic losses of small segments, with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at
5q13.2 and 8p23.1 identified most frequently. Of the 83 HCC cases, 30 (36.1%)
cases were identified with LOH at 5q13.2, where known tumor-associated genes are 
located, including general transcription factor IIH subunit 2 (GTF2H2),
baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 1 (BIRC1) and occludin (OCLN). LOH
frequency at 8p23.1 in HCC was 61.29% (D8S1130) and 68.4% (D8S503) respectively, 
similar to the results obtained in previous studies. In conclusion, the results
of the present study provided evidence that genomic losses at 5q13.2 and 8p23.1
identified in dysplastic hepatocytes of the cirrhotic liver are common events in 
HCC. HCC-associated chromosomal abnormalities may occur and accumulate in
preneoplastic lesions of liver cirrhosis.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative
disorder characterised commonly by proximal muscle weakness and wasting in the
absence of sensory signs. Deletion or disruption of the SMN1 gene causes the
disease. The SMN1 gene is located within an inverted duplication on chromosome
5q13 with the genes SMN2, NAIP and GTF2H2. MLPA analysis of 13 Cypriot SMA
patients revealed that, 12 patients carried a homozygous SMN1 gene deletion and
one patient carried two copies of the SMN1 gene. Two of 13 cases were a
consequence of a paternally originating de novo mutation. Five genotypes were
identified within the population, with the most frequent being a homozygous SMN1 
and NAIP genes deletion. In conclusion, genotype-phenotype correlation revealed
that SMN2 is inversely related to disease severity and that NAIP and GTF2H2 act
as negative modifiers. This study provided, for the first time, a comprehensive
overview of gene copy numbers and inheritance patterns within Cypriot SMA
families.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of copy number variations of SMN1, SMN2,
NAIP, GTF2H2 and H4F5 genes with clinical classification of spinal muscular
atrophy in children, and determine the copy number of the SMN gene among pregnant
women. A carrier screening was also performed in Sichuan province.
METHODS: The copy number variations of the above genes among 53 confirmed SMA
patients were determined with MLPA technique. The copy number variations were
analyzed by the Fisher's exact test. Deletion of exon 7 in the SMN1 gene was
screened with denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) for 427
pregnant women.
RESULTS: Among the 53 cases of type I, II, and III SMA patients, the rate of
homozygous deletion of both exons 7 and 8 of the SMN1 gene were 100%, 94.44% and 
87.50%, respectively, whereas those of homozygous deletion of exon 7 of SMN1 gene
were 0, 5.56%, and 12.50%, respectively. The patients with 1, 2, 3, and 4 copies 
of exon 7 of the SMN2 gene were 11.32%, 67.92%, 13.21% and 7.55%, respectively.
The patients with 0, 1, and 2 copies of exon 5 of NAIP gene were 11.32%, 62.26%, 
and 26.42%, respectively. No deletion was detected in GTF2H2 or H4F5 genes. The
heterozygous loss rate of exon 7 in SMN gene in the pregnant women population of 
Sichuan region was approximately 2.11%.
CONCLUSION: Copy number variations of SMN2 and NAIP genes in patients are related
to SMA clinical types (P < 0.05). In contrast, there was no relationship between 
SMA clinical types and deletion of exons 7 and 8 in the SMN1 gene (P > 0.05).
Analysis of copy number change in SMN1 gene can assist SMA carrier screening.
However, when the general population without SMA family history is screened for
disease-causing genes, it should be noted that the type "2+0" carriers may affect
the screening result, and the result should be interpreted with caution.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a common and lethal autosomal recessive
neurodegenerative disorder, which is caused by mutations of the survival motor
neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. Additionally, the phenotype is modified by several genes
nearby SMN1 in the 5q13 region. In this study, we analyzed mutations in SMN1 and 
quantified the modifying genes, including SMN2, NAIP, GTF2H2, and H4F5 by
polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP),
multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), TA cloning,
allele-specific long-range PCR, and Sanger sequencing in 157 SMA patients. Most
SMA patients (94.90%) possessed a homozygous SMN1 deletion, while 10 patients
demonstrated only the absence of exon 7, but the presence of exon 8. Two missense
mutations (c.689 C>T and c.844 C>T) were identified in 2 patients who both
carried a single copy of SMN1. We found inverse correlations between SMN2, the
NAIP copy number, and the clinical severity of the disease. Furthermore, 7 severe
type I patients possessed large-scale deletions, including SMN1, NAIP, and
GTF2H2. We conclude that SMN1 gene conversion, SMN1 subtle mutations, SMN2 copy
number, and the extent of deletion in the 5q13 region should all be considered in
the genotype-phenotype analysis of SMA.

Luteolin Regulation of Estrogen Signaling and Cell Cycle Pathway Genes in MCF-7
Human Breast Cancer Cells.

Author information:

cRNA microarray and real-time PCR (qPCR) studies identified a number of Estrogen 
Signaling Pathway (ESP) genes (GTF2H2, NCOR1, TAF9, NRAS, NRIP1, POLR2A, DDX5,
NCOA3) and Cell Cycle Pathway genes (CCNA2, PCNA, CDKN1A, CCND1, PLK1) in MCF-7
breast cancer cells that are regulated by the bioflavonoid luteolin. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies revealed that luteolin modified histone H4
acetylation at the PLK-1 promoter suggesting that this bioflavonoid controls gene
transcription via an epigenetic mechanism involving histone H4 acetylation. These
findings are consistent with the anti-estrogenic and anti-proliferative
properties of luteolin in normal and malignant cells.

AIMS: To describe the occurrence of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in childhood;
to evaluate if any of the genes in the SMA region on chromosome 5q13 correlates
with disease severity; to make genotype-phenotype correlations; to evaluate the
variability of different disease alleles in carriers and the sensitivity of
multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for detecting carriers.
METHODS: In a population-based study from Western Sweden MLPA was used to
determine the copy-numbers of several genes in the SMA region (SMN1, SMN2, BIRC1,
GTF2H2 and SERF1A) in SMA-patients and their parents.
RESULTS: We estimated the incidence of SMN1-related SMA in childhood at 1 in 11
800 live births and confirmed the relationship between the number of SMN2 copies 
and the severity of disease. No other direct relationships were found. All but
one of the analysed parents were confirmed as carriers by MLPA analysis. A total 
of at least 30 different disease alleles were identified and no specific disease 
allele represented more than 15% of the total.
CONCLUSION: The childhood incidence of SMA in the Swedish population is around 1 
in 12,000 live births and it is unlikely that there is any founder effect
involved in SMA in western Sweden.

Arabidopsis homologue of human transcription factor IIH/nucleotide excision
repair factor p44 can function in transcription and DNA repair and interacts with
AtXPD.

Eukaryotic general transcription factor (TF) IIH is composed of 10 proteins,
seven of which are also required for nucleotide excision repair (NER) of UV
radiation-induced DNA damage in human cells and yeast. Plant homologues of the
human TFIIH subunits XPB and XPD that function in NER have been isolated but none
has been shown to operate in transcription. Here we address the capabilities of
Arabidopsis thaliana AtGTF2H2 and AtXPD, homologues of the essential interacting 
human/yeast TFIIH components p44/Ssl1 and XPD/Rad3, respectively. Expression of
AtGTF2H2 or AtXPD cDNAs in yeast ssl1 or rad3 mutants temperature-sensitive for
growth due to thermolabile transcription of mRNA restored growth and so
transcription at the non-permissive temperature. AtGTF2H2 also complemented the
NER deficiency of the corresponding yeast mutant, as measured by full recovery of
UV resistance, whereas AtXPD did not despite being necessary for NER in
Arabidopsis. UV treatment did not upregulate transcription of AtGTF2H2 or AtXPD
in Arabidopsis. Suppression of a yeast translation initiation defect by the
ssl1-1 mutation was prevented by expression of AtGTF2H2. Deletion of SSL1 in a
yeast strain expressing AtGTF2H2 did not affect growth or confer UV sensitivity, 
demonstrating that AtGTF2H2 can perform all essential transcription functions and
UV damage repair duties of Ssl1 in its absence. Furthermore, AtGTF2H2 interacted 
with AtXPD and yeast Rad3, and AtXPD also interacted with yeast Ssl1 in
two-hybrid assays. Our results indicate that AtGTF2H2 can act in transcription
and NER, and suggest that it participates in both processes in Arabidopsis as
part of TFIIH.

BACKGROUND: Although 40-50% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors respond 
to cisplatin chemotherapy, there currently is no way to prospectively identify
potential responders. The purpose of this study was to determine whether
transcript abundance (TA) levels of twelve selected DNA repair or multi-drug
resistance genes (LIG1, ERCC2, ERCC3, DDIT3, ABCC1, ABCC4, ABCC5, ABCC10, GTF2H2,
XPA, XPC and XRCC1) were associated with cisplatin chemoresistance and could
therefore contribute to the development of a predictive marker. Standardized RT
(StaRT)-PCR, was employed to assess these genes in a set of NSCLC cell lines with
a previously published range of sensitivity to cisplatin. Data were obtained in
the form of target gene molecules relative to 106 beta-actin (ACTB) molecules. To
cancel the effect of ACTB variation among the different cell lines individual
gene expression values were incorporated into ratios of one gene to another. Each
two-gene ratio was compared as a single variable to chemoresistance for each of
eight NSCLC cell lines using multiple regression. In an effort to validate these 
results, six additional lines then were evaluated.
RESULTS: Following validation, single variable models best correlated with
chemoresistance (p < 0.001), were ERCC2/XPC, ABCC5/GTF2H2, ERCC2/GTF2H2, XPA/XPC 
and XRCC1/XPC. All single variable models were examined hierarchically to achieve
two variable models. The two variable model with the highest correlation was
(ABCC5/GTF2H2, ERCC2/GTF2H2) with an R2 value of 0.96 (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: These results provide markers suitable for assessment of small fine
needle aspirate biopsies in an effort to prospectively identify cisplatin
resistant tumors.

Cosegregation of markers on chromosome 5q12.3-q14.1 with profound congenital
deafness in two Pakistani families (PKDF041 and PKDF141) defines a new recessive 
deafness locus, DFNB49. A maximum two-point lod score of 4.44 and 5.94 at
recombination fraction theta=0 was obtained for markers D5S2055 and D5S424 in
families PKDF041 and PKDF141, respectively. Haplotype analysis revealed an 11 cM 
linkage region flanked by markers D5S647 (74.07 cM) and D5S1501 (85.25 cM).
Candidate deafness genes in this region include SLC30A5, OCLN, GTF2H2, and BTF3, 
encoding solute carrier family 30 (zinc transporter) member 5, occludin, RNA
polymerase II transcription initiation factor, and basic transcription factor 3, 
respectively. Sequence analysis of the coding exons of SLC30A5 in DNA samples
from two affected individuals of families PKDF041 and PKDF141 revealed no
mutation. The mapping of DFNB49 further confirms the heterogeneity underlying
autosomal recessive forms of nonsyndromic deafness.
