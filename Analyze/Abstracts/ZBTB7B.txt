CD40 ligand is induced in CD4(+) Th cells upon TCR stimulation and provides an
activating signal to B cells, making CD40 ligand an important molecule for Th
cell function. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms, whereby CD40 ligand
becomes expressed on the cell surface in T cells remain unclear. Here, we showed 
that CD40 ligand expression in CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells was suppressed by
combined epigenetic regulations in the promoter region of the Cd40lg gene, such
as the methylation of CpG dinucleotides, histone H3 lysine 9, histone H3 lysine
27, and histone H4 lysine 20. As the transcription factor Th-inducing pox virus
and zinc finger/Kruppel-like factor (encoded by the Zbtb7b gene) is critical in
Th cell development, we focused on the role of Th-inducing pox virus and zinc
finger/Kruppel-like factor in CD40 ligand expression. We found that CD40 ligand
expression is moderately induced by retroviral Thpok transduction into CD8(+)
cytotoxic T cells, which was accompanied by a reduction of histone H3 lysine 9
methylation and histone H3 lysine 27 methylation in the promoter region of the
Cd40lg gene. Th-inducing pox virus and zinc finger/Kruppel-like factor directly
inhibited the expression of murine CXXC5, a CXXC-type zinc finger protein that
induced histone H3 lysine 9 methylation, in part, through an interaction with the
histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SUV39H1. In addition, to inhibit CD40 ligand
induction in activated CD4(+) T cells by the CXXC5 transgene, our findings
indicate that CXXC5 was one of the key molecules contributing to repressing CD40 
ligand expression in CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells.

The transcription factor T-helper-inducing POZ/Krueppel-like factor (ThPOK,
encoded by the Zbtb7b gene) plays widespread and critical roles in T-cell
development, particularly as the master regulator of CD4 commitment. Here we show
that mice expressing a constitutive T-cell-specific ThPOK transgene (ThPOK(const)
mice) develop thymic lymphomas. These tumors resemble human T-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), in that they predominantly exhibit activating
Notch1 mutations. Lymphomagenesis is prevented if thymocyte development is
arrested at the DN3 stage by recombination-activating gene (RAG) deficiency, but 
restored by introduction of a T-cell receptor (TCR) transgene or by a single
injection of anti-aßTCR antibody into ThPOK(const) RAG-deficient mice, which
promotes development to the CD4(+)8(+) (DP) stage. Hence, TCR signals and/or
traversal of the DN (double negative) > DP (double positive) checkpoint are
required for ThPOK-mediated lymphomagenesis. These results demonstrate a novel
link between ThPOK, TCR signaling, and lymphomagenesis. Finally, we present
evidence that ectopic ThPOK expression gives rise to a preleukemic and
self-perpetuating DN4 lymphoma precursor population. Our results collectively
define a novel role for ThPOK as an oncogene and precisely map the stage in
thymopoiesis susceptible to ThPOK-dependent tumor initiation.

The intestinal epithelium harbors large populations of activated and memory
lymphocytes, yet these cells do not cause tissue damage in the steady state. We
investigated how intestinal T cell effector differentiation is regulated upon
migration to the intestinal epithelium. Using gene loss- and gain-of-function
strategies, as well as reporter approaches, we showed that cooperation between
the transcription factors T-bet and Runx3 resulted in suppression of conventional
CD4(+) T helper functions and induction of an intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL)
program that included expression of IEL markers such as CD8aa homodimers.
Interferon-<U+03B3> sensing and T-bet expression by CD4(+) T cells were both required
for this program, which was distinct from conventional T helper differentiation
but shared by other IEL populations, including TCRaß(+)CD8aa(+) IELs. We conclude
that the gut environment provides cues for IEL maturation through the interplay
between T-bet and Runx3, allowing tissue-specific adaptation of mature T
lymphocytes.

During thymic development, thymocytes expressing a T cell receptor consisting of 
an alpha and beta chain (TCRaß), commit to either the cytotoxic- or T
helper-lineage fate. This lineage dichotomy is controlled by key transcription
factors, including the T helper (Th) lineage master regulator, the Th-inducing
BTB/POZ domain-containing Kruppel-like zinc-finger transcription factor, ThPOK,
(formally cKrox or Zfp67; encoded by Zbtb7b), which suppresses the cytolytic
program in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted CD4(+)
thymocytes and the Runt related transcription factor 3 (Runx3), which counteracts
ThPOK in MHC class I restricted precursor cells and promotes the lineage
commitment of CD8aß(+) cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL). ThPOK continues to repress 
the CTL gene program in mature CD4(+) T cells, even as they differentiate into
effector Th cell subsets. The Th cell fate however is not fixed and two recent
studies showed that mature, antigen-stimulated CD4(+) T cells have the
flexibility to terminate the expression of ThPOK and functionally reprogram to
cytotoxic effector cells. This unexpected plasticity of CD4(+) T cells results in
the post-thymic termination of the Th lineage fate and the functional
differentiation of distinct MHC class II-restricted CD4(+) CTL. The recognition
of CD4 CTL as a defined separate subset of effector cells and the identification 
of the mechanisms and factors that drive their reprogramming finally create new
opportunities to explore the physiological relevance of these effector cells in
vivo and to determine their pivotal roles in both, protective immunity as well as
in immune-related pathology.

lymphocytes.

CD4(+) helper and CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells, two major subsets of aßTCR expressing
lymphocytes, are differentiated from common precursor CD4(+)CD8(+)
double-positive (DP) thymocytes. Bifurcation of the CD4(+)/CD8(+) lineages in the
thymus is a multilayered process and is thought to culminate in a loss of
developmental plasticity between these functional subsets. Advances in the last
decade have deepened our understanding of the transcription control mechanisms
governing CD4 versus CD8 lineage commitment. Reciprocal expression and
antagonistic interplay between two transcription factors, ThPOK and Runx3, is
crucial for driving thymocyte decisions between these two cell fates. Here, we
first focus on the regulation of ThPOK expression and its role in directing
helper T cell development. We then discuss a novel aspect of the ThPOK/Runx3 axis
in modifying CD4(+) T cell function upon exposure to gut microenvironment.

The abundant expression of IFN<U+03B3> in Th-inducing POK (ThPOK)-deficient CD4(+) T
cells requires the activation of Eomesodermin (Eomes); however, the underlying
mechanism of this phenomenon remains unclear. Here we report that ThPOK binds
directly to the promoter region of the Eomes gene to repress its expression in
CD4(+) T cells. We identified the histone acetyltransferase TIP60 as a
co-repressor of ThPOK-target genes, where ectopically expressed TIP60 increased
ThPOK protein stability by promoting its acetylation at its Lys(360) residue to
then augment the transcriptional repression of Eomes. Moreover, knockdown of
endogenous TIP60 abolished the stabilization of ThPOK in CD4(+) T cells, which
led to the transcriptional activation of Eomes and increased production of IFN<U+03B3>. 
Our results reveal a novel pathway by which TIP60 and ThPOK synergistically
suppresses Eomes function and IFN<U+03B3> production, which could contribute to the
regulation of inflammation.

Epigenetic Thpok silencing limits the time window to choose CD4(+) helper-lineage
fate in the thymus.

CD4(+) helper and CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells differentiate from common precursors
in the thymus after T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated selection. Commitment to the
helper lineage depends on persistent TCR signals and expression of the ThPOK
transcription factor, whereas a ThPOK cis-regulatory element, ThPOK silencer,
represses Thpok gene expression during commitment to the cytotoxic lineage. Here,
we show that silencer-mediated alterations of chromatin structures in
cytotoxic-lineage thymocytes establish a repressive state that is epigenetically 
inherited in peripheral CD8(+) T cells even after removal of the silencer. When
silencer activity is enhanced in helper-lineage cells, by increasing its copy
number, a similar heritable Thpok silencing occurs. Epigenetic locking of the
Thpok locus may therefore be an independent event from commitment to the
cytotoxic lineage. These findings imply that long-lasting TCR signals are needed 
to establish stable Thpok expression activity to commit to helper T-cell fate and
that full commitment to the helper lineage requires persistent reversal of
silencer activity during a particular time window.

We purposed to evaluate the role of Th inducing POZ-Kruppel Factor (ThPOK), a
transcriptional regulator of T cell fate, in tumour-induced immune system
plasticity in colorectal carcinogenesis. The amounts of CD4+, CD8+ and CD56+ and 
ThPOK+ cells infiltrate in normal colorectal mucosa (NM), in dysplastic aberrant 
crypt foci (microadenomas, MA), the earliest detectable lesions in colorectal
carcinogenesis, and in colorectal carcinomas (CRC), were measured, and the
colocalization of ThPOK with the above-mentioned markers of immune cells was
evaluated using confocal microscopy. Interestingly, ThPOK showed a prominent
increase since MA. A strong colocalization of ThPOK with CD4 both in NM and in MA
was observed, weaker in carcinomas. Surprisingly, there was a peak in the
colocalization levels of ThPOK with CD8 in MA, which was evident, although to a
lesser extent, in carcinomas, too. In conclusion, according to the data of the
present study, ThPOK may be considered a central regulator of the earliest events
in the immune system during colorectal cancer development, decreasing the immune 
response against cancer cells.

In fish, T cell lineage commitment has not been studied, although there are
reports related to CD4 and CD8 positive cells. This study describes the cloning
and analysis of a master regulator involved in this process, the Th-POK gene in
Japanese pufferfish, Takifugu rubripes. The Fugu Th-POK cDNA was composed of 1901
bp, with a 75 bp 5'-UTR, a 131 bp 3'-UTR, and a 1692 bp open reading frame which 
translates into a peptide of 564 amino acid residues. The deduced Fugu Th-POK
protein contained a BTB/POZ domain, Krüppel motif (H/C linker) and Krüppel-like
zinc finger DNA binding domain with C2H2 structure. The homology analysis of Fugu
Th-POK (ZBTB7B) with other known ZBTB7 members (ZBTB7A, 7C) showed low identity, 
and the phylogenetic tree analysis showed the Fugu Th-POK clustered with the
mammalian Th-POK, away from other ZBTB7 members. The analysis of transcriptional 
control region of Th-POK gene suggested that the 5'-flanking region and intron 1 
include numerous canonical binding motifs for transcription factors regulating T 
cell development. The genomic organization of the Fugu Th-POK gene was composed
of three exons and two introns, and its structure was identical to that of its
human counterpart. Comparison of the Fugu and human genomes showed that high
levels of conserved synteny existed around the Th-POK gene. The high expression
of the Fugu Th-POK gene in unstimulated tissues was seen in head kidney, muscle, 
skin and gills. Moreover, the expression of the Fugu Th-POK gene in thymic cells 
was increased by LPS, polyI:C and PHA stimulation.

CD1d-dependent NKT cells represent a heterogeneous family of effector T cells
including CD4(+)CD8(-) and CD4(-)CD8(-) subsets that respond to glycolipid Ags
with rapid and potent cytokine production. NKT cell development is regulated by a
unique combination of factors, however very little is known about factors that
control the development of NKT subsets. In this study, we analyze a novel mouse
strain (helpless) with a mis-sense mutation in the BTB-POZ domain of ZBTB7B and
demonstrate that this mutation has dramatic, intrinsic effects on development of 
NKT cell subsets. Although NKT cell numbers are similar in Zbtb7b mutant mice,
these cells are hyperproliferative and most lack CD4 and instead express CD8.
Moreover, the majority of ZBTB7B mutant NKT cells in the thymus are retinoic
acid-related orphan receptor <U+03B3>t positive, and a high frequency produce IL-17
while very few produce IFN-<U+03B3> or other cytokines, sharply contrasting the profile 
of normal NKT cells. Mice heterozygous for the helpless mutation also have
reduced numbers of CD4(+) NKT cells and increased production of IL-17 without an 
increase in CD8(+) cells, suggesting that ZBTB7B acts at multiple stages of NKT
cell development. These results reveal ZBTB7B as a critical factor genetically
predetermining the balance of effector subsets within the NKT cell population.

Intrathymic CD4/CD8 differentiation is a process that establishes the mutually
exclusive expression profiles of the CD4 and CD8 T cell lineage. The
RUNX3-mediated silencing of CD4 in CD8 lineage cells has been well documented;
however, it is unclear how CD8 is silenced during CD4 lineage differentiation. In
this study, we report that, by directly binding the CD8 locus, ThPOK works as a
negative regulator that mediates the deacetylation of Cd8 genes and repositions
the CD8 alleles close to heterochromatin during the development of the CD4
lineage. The ectopic expression of ThPOK resulted in increased recruitment of
histone deacetylases at Cd8 loci; the enhanced deacetylation of Cd8 genes
eventually led to impaired Cd8 transcription. In the absence of ThPOK, the
enhanced acetylation and transcription of Cd8 genes were observed. The results of
these studies showed that Cd8 loci are the direct targets of ThPOK, and, more
importantly, they provide new insights into CD8 silencing during CD4 lineage
commitment.

SERPINA3 (Serpin peptidase inhibitor clade A member 3), also known as
a1-antichymotrypsin, is a serine protease inhibitor involved in a wide range of
biological processes. Recently, it has been shown to be up-regulated in human
placental diseases in association with a hypomethylation of the 5' region of the 
gene. In the present study, we show that the promoter of SERPINA3 is
transcriptionally activated by three transcription factors (TFs) (SP1, MZF1 and
ZBTB7B), the level of induction being dependent on the rs1884082 single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located inside the promoter, the T allele being
consistently induced to a higher level than the G, with or without added TFs.
When the promoter was methylated, the response to ZBTB7B was allele specific (the
G allele was strongly induced, while the T allele was strongly down-regulated).
We propose an adaptive model to explain the interest of such a regulation for
placental function and homeostasis. Overexpression of SERPINA3 in JEG-3 cells, a 
trophoblast cell model, decreased cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix and
to neighboring cells, but protects them from apoptosis, suggesting a way by which
this factor could be deleterious at high doses. In addition, we show in different
human populations that the T allele appears to predispose to Intra Uterine Growth
Restriction (IUGR), while a G allele at a second SNP located in the second exon
(rs4634) increases the risk of preeclampsia. Our results provide mechanistic
views inside the involvement of SERPINA3 in placental diseases, through its
regulation by a combination of epigenetic, genetic and TF-mediated regulations.

Transcriptional mechanisms regulating type I collagen genes expression in
physiopathological situations are not completely known. In this study, we have
investigated the role of nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B) transcription factor on type I
collagen expression in adult normal human (ANF) and scleroderma (SF) fibroblasts.
We demonstrated that NF-<U+03BA>B, a master transcription factor playing a major role in
immune response/apoptosis, down-regulates COL1A1 expression by a transcriptional 
control involving the -112/-61 bp sequence. This 51-bp region mediates the action
of two zinc fingers, Sp1 (specific protein-1) and Sp3, acting as trans-activators
of type I collagen expression in ANF and SF. Knockdown of each one of these trans
factors by siRNA confirmed the trans-activating effect of Sp1/Sp3 and the p65
subunit of NF-<U+03BA>B trans-inhibiting effect on COL1A1 expression. Despite no
existing <U+03BA>B consensus sequence in the COL1A1 promoter, we found that
Sp1/Sp3/c-Krox and NF-<U+03BA>B bind and/or are recruited on the proximal promoter in
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Attempts to elucidate whether
interactions between Sp1/Sp3/c-Krox and p65 are necessary to mediate the NF-<U+03BA>B
inhibitory effect on COL1A1 in ANF and SF were carried out; in this regard,
immunoprecipitation assays revealed that they interact, and this was validated by
re-ChIP. Finally, the knockdown of Sp1/Sp3/c-Krox prevents the p65 inhibitory
effect on COL1A1 transcription in ANF, whereas only the siRNAs targeting Sp3 and 
c-Krox provoked the same effect in SF, suggesting that particular interactions
are characteristic of the scleroderma phenotype. In conclusion, our findings
highlight a new mechanism for COL1A1 transcriptional regulation by NF-<U+03BA>B, and
these data could allow the development of new antifibrotic strategies.

T cell fate is associated with mutually exclusive expression of CD4 or CD8 in
helper and cytotoxic T cells, respectively. How expression of one locus is
temporally coordinated with repression of the other has been a long-standing
enigma, though we know RUNX transcription factors activate the Cd8 locus, silence
the Cd4 locus, and repress the Zbtb7b locus (encoding the transcription factor
ThPOK), which is required for CD4 expression. Here we found that nuclear
organization was altered by interplay among members of this transcription factor 
circuitry: RUNX binding mediated association of Cd4 and Cd8 whereas ThPOK binding
kept the loci apart. Moreover, targeted deletions within Cd4 modulated CD8
expression and pericentromeric repositioning of Cd8. Communication between Cd4
and Cd8 thus appears to enable long-range epigenetic regulation to ensure that
expression of one excludes the other in mature CD4 or CD8 single-positive (SP)
cells.

GATA-3 is necessary for the development of MHC class II-restricted CD4 T cells,
and its expression is increased during positive selection of these cells. TCR
signals drive this upregulation, but the signaling pathways that control this
process are not well understood. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we
show that GATA-3 upregulation during thymocyte-positive selection is the result
of additive inputs from the Ras/MAPK and calcineurin pathways. This upregulation 
requires the presence of the transcription factor c-Myb. Furthermore, we show
that TH-POK can also upregulate GATA-3 in double-positive thymocytes, suggesting 
the existence of a positive feedback loop that contributes to lock in the initial
commitment to the CD4 lineage during differentiation.

The role of the zinc finger transcription factor ThPOK (T-helper-inducing
POZ-Kruppel-like factor) in promoting commitment of aß T cells to the CD4 lineage
is now well established. New results indicate that ThPOK is also important for
the development and/or acquisition of effector functions by other T cell subsets,
including several not marked by CD4 expression, i.e. double-negative invariant
natural killer T (iNKT) cells, <U+03B3>d cells, and even memory CD8(+) T cells. There is
compelling evidence that ThPOK expression in most or all of these cases is
dependent on T-cell receptor signaling and that differences in relative TCR
signal strength/length may induce different levels of ThPOK expression. The
developmental consequences of ThPOK expression vary according to cell type, which
may partly reflect differences in ThPOK levels and/or in transcriptional networks
between cell types.

CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells develop from CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes. Although it has
been reported that expression of the transcription factor Th-POK is important for
CD4(+) T cell development, the detailed mechanism regulating Th-POK expression is
still obscure. By comparing the promoter regions of the Th-POK gene between human
and mouse, I found that the region 3600 base pairs (bps) upstream from the
transcription initiation site of the Th-POK gene was highly conserved. To
identify the important element(s) regulating Th-POK expression in CD4(+) T cells,
I investigated the promoter activity of this region using a luciferase assay in
the human T cell line Jurkat. I identified a positive regulatory element in this 
region 22 bps in length located 600 bp upstream from the transcription initiation
site. This 22 bp element had a consensus binding sequence for SAP-1, which is
encoded by the Elk4 gene and is activated by the Erk pathway. These data suggest 
that the 22 bp element might positively regulate Th-POK expression through
Erk-SAP-1 signaling.

p300-mediated acetylation stabilizes the Th-inducing POK factor.

Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.

The lineage-specifying factor Th-inducing POK (ThPOK) directs the intrathymic
differentiation of CD4 T cells. Although the regulation of ThPOK at the
transcription level has been extensively studied, specific posttranslational
modifications regulating the activity of ThPOK have not been addressed. In this
paper, we show that ThPOK is an unstable protein that is more readily degraded in
CD8 T cells compared with CD4 T cells. Among the various proteins that bind
ThPOK, acetyltransferase p300 specifically promotes the acetylation of ThPOK at
K210, K216, and K339, outcompeting ubiquitination, thereby stabilizing the
protein. In CD4 T cells, attenuation of p300-mediated acetylation promotes the
degradation of ThPOK. In contrast, mutation of lysines 210, 216, and 339 to
arginines stabilizes ThPOK and enhances its ability to suppress the expression of
CD8 molecule and cytotoxic effectors in CD8 T cells. Our results reveal an
essential role of p300-mediated acetylation in regulating the stability of ThPOK 
and suggest that such regulation may play a part in CD4/CD8 lineage
differentiation.

Bcl11b represses a mature T-cell gene expression program in immature CD4(+)CD8(+)
thymocytes.

Bcl11b is a transcription factor that, within the hematopoietic system, is
expressed specifically in T cells. Although Bcl11b is required for T-cell
differentiation in newborn Bcl11b-null mice, and for positive selection in the
adult thymus of mice bearing a T-cell-targeted deletion, the gene network
regulated by Bcl11b in T cells is unclear. We report herein that Bcl11b is a
bifunctional transcriptional regulator, which is required for the correct
expression of approximately 1000 genes in CD4(+)CD8(+)CD3(lo) double-positive
(DP) thymocytes. Bcl11b-deficient DP cells displayed a gene expression program
associated with mature CD4(+)CD8(-) and CD4(-)CD8(+) single-positive (SP)
thymocytes, including upregulation of key transcriptional regulators, such as
Zbtb7b and Runx3. Bcl11b interacted with regulatory regions of many dysregulated 
genes, suggesting a direct role in the transcriptional regulation of these genes.
However, inappropriate expression of lineage-associated genes did not result in
enhanced differentiation, as deletion of Bcl11b in DP cells prevented development
of SP thymocytes, and that of canonical NKT cells. These data establish Bcl11b as
a crucial transcriptional regulator in thymocytes, in which Bcl11b functions to
prevent the premature expression of genes fundamental to the SP and NKT cell
differentiation programs.

separation of CD4 and CD8 repertoire selection at different signaling thresholds.

To investigate the temporal regulation of the commitment of immature thymocytes
to either the CD4(+) or the CD8(+) lineage in the thymus, we developed a
transgenic mouse that expressed a tetracycline-inducible gene encoding the
tyrosine kinase zeta chain-associated protein kinase of 70 kD (Zap70), which
restored development in Zap70(-/-) thymocytes arrested at the preselection,
CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive (DP) stage. After induction of the expression of
Zap70 and the production of Zap70 protein, CD4(+) single-positive (SP) cells that
expressed Zbtb7b (which encodes the CD4(+) T cell-associated transcription factor
ThPOK) became abundant within 30 hours, whereas CD8(+) SP cells were not
detectable until day 4. We found that mature CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells arose from
phenotypically distinct subsets of DP thymocytes that developed with different
kinetics and contrasting sensitivities to stimulation of the T cell antigen
receptor (TCR). In wild-type mice, expression of endogenous Zap70 progressively
increased during maturation of the DP subsets, and the abundance of Zap70 protein
determined the sensitivity of the cells to stimulation of the TCR. This temporal 
gradient in the amount of Zap70 protein enabled the selection of CD4(+) and
CD8(+) repertoires in separate temporal windows and at different TCR signaling
thresholds, thereby facilitating discrimination of distinct positive selection
signals in these lineages.

The normal counterparts of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified
(PTCL-NOS) have not been accurately identified. We immunohistochemically analyzed
10 PTCL-NOS cases to examine the expression of the master regulators of T-cell
differentiation and of surface antigens, including chemokine receptors. All cases
were positive for the master regulator of helper T cells (Th-POK) and the marker 
of effector T cells (CD45RO). Three cases each were positive for T-Bet and GATA3,
which are master regulators of helper T cells (T(H) ) type 1 (T(H)1) and 2
(T(H)2), respectively. Two cases were positive for the surface antigens of
central memory (Tcm) (CCR7 and CD62L), and 1 case was positive for follicular
helper T-cell (TFH) phenotype (BCL6, CXCL13, and PD-1). The remaining case was
negative for all markers of effector T(H) subtypes. These results suggest the
postulated normal counterparts of PTCL-NOS identified in 9 of the 10 cases
consist of T(H)1, T(H)2, TCM, and TFH.

Thymoma is a thymic epithelial neoplasm which induces T cell development.
However, the frequency of mature CD4(+) T cells in thymomas is lower than in
normal thymi. Recently, CD4/CD8 lineage commitment has been elucidated in animal 
model. The zinc finger transcription factor Th-POK is a critical factor to CD4(+)
T cell development in CD4/CD8 lineage commitment, whereas CD8(+) T cell
development requires the transcription factor Runx3. These factors antagonize in 
CD4/CD8 lineage commitment. In this study, we examined Th-POK and Runx3 mRNA
expression in the T cell subsets of human normal thymus and thymoma. A
quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction examination revealed
that Th-POK expression in normal thymi was higher in the CD4(+)CD8(-) subset than
in the CD4(+)CD8(+) and CD4(-)CD8(+) subsets. In thymomas, Th-POK expression in
the CD4(+)CD8(-) subset was significantly lower than that in normal thymi, and
was significantly correlated with the proportion of CD3(+) cells in the
CD4(+)CD8(-) subset. However, Th-POK expressions of the CD3(+)CD4(+)CD8(+) and
CD3(+)CD4(+)CD8(-) subsets were not impaired in thymomas compared to normal
thymi. These results suggest that thymoma neoplastic epithelial cells can induce 
Th-POK expression similarly to the normal thymic epithelial cells. In addition,
there was no significant difference in Runx3 expression between normal thymi and 
thymomas. Therefore, CD4/CD8 lineage commitment dependent on Th-POK and Runx3
system seems to be working even in the neoplastic environment formed by human
thymomas.

Human CD34(+) hematopoietic precursor cells cultured on delta-like ligand 1
expressing OP9 (OP9-DL1) stromal cells differentiate to T lineage cells. The
nature of the T cells generated in these cultures has not been studied in detail.
Since these cultures do not contain thymic epithelial cells which are the main
cell type mediating positive selection in vivo, generation of conventional helper
CD4(+) and cytotoxic CD8(+) TCRalphabeta cells is not expected. Phenotypically
mature CD27(+)CD1(-) TCRgammadelta as well as TCRalphabeta cells were generated
in OP9-DL1 cultures. CD8 and few mature CD4 single-positive TCRalphabeta cells
were observed. Mature CD8 single-positive cells consisted of two subpopulations: 
one expressing mainly CD8alphabeta and one expressing CD8alphaalpha dimers.
TCRalphabeta CD8alphaalpha and TCRgammadelta cells both expressed the IL2Rbeta
receptor constitutively and proliferated on IL-15, a characteristic of
unconventional T cells. CD8alphabeta(+) and CD4(+) TCRalphabeta cells were
unresponsive to IL-15, but could be expanded upon TCR stimulation as mature
CD8alphabeta(+) and CD4(+) T cells. These T cells had the characteristics of
conventional T cells: CD4(+) cells expressed ThPOK, CD40L, and high levels of
IL-2 and IL-4; CD8(+) cells expressed Eomes, Runx3, and high levels of granzyme, 
perforin, and IFN-gamma. Induction of murine or human MHC class I expression on
OP9-DL1 cells had no influence on the differentiation of mature CD8(+) cells.
Similarly, the presence of dendritic cells was not required for the generation of
mature CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells. These data suggest that positive selection of
these cells is induced by interaction between T precursor cells.

CD4-positive helper T cells and CD8-positive cytotoxic T cells comprise the
majority of T lymphocytes present in secondary lymphoid organs and are essential 
for acquired immunity. These two populations are derived from common precursors
in the thymus and selected through interaction between their clonal T-cell
receptors and major histocompatibility complex molecules. Although intensely
studied as a model system for binary cell fate decisions, the mechanisms
underlying the helper versus cytotoxic lineage choice in the thymus has been
elusive. In the past few years, it has been demonstrated that the Runx family of 
transcription factors, particularly Runx3, is essential for the generation of
cytotoxic lineage T cells, whereas the ThPOK zinc finger transcription factor
that plays a crucial role in the differentiation of the helper lineage. Recent
works have implied that a cross-regulation between Runx and ThPOK contributes to 
appropriate thymocyte lineage commitment. In this article, recent findings on the
transcription factor networks governing thymocyte lineage decisions are
discussed, focusing on the two factors, and provide insights into mechanisms of
lineage-specific gene regulation in the process of T-cell commitments.

Differentiation of CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive (DP) thymocytes into either
CD4(+)-helper or CD8(+)-cytotoxic lineages involves several phases. It has been
suggested that, following initial specification to one of the lineages by a set
of lineage-specific genes during positive selection, stable cell identity is
established during the commitment process by eliminating differentiation
potential toward the other lineage. While the Runx3 transcription factor fixes
the Cd4 gene into a silenced state during cytotoxic-lineage cell differentiation,
the ThPOK transcription factor is both necessary and sufficient to generate a
CD4(+)CD8(-) phenotype in post-selection thymocytes, regardless of the MHC
specificity of the TCRs. Recent studies have revealed that a reciprocal
antagonistic interplay between Runx3 and ThPOK is a central component in the
transcription factor network governing the helper versus cytotoxic-lineage
decision.

How CD4-CD8 differentiation is maintained in mature T cells is largely unknown.
The present study has examined the role in this process of the zinc finger
protein Zbtb7b, a critical factor for the commitment of MHC II-restricted
thymocytes to the CD4+ lineage. We showed that Zbtb7b acted in peripheral CD4+ T 
cells to suppress CD8-lineage gene expression, including that of CD8 and
cytotoxic effector genes perforin and Granzyme B, and was important for the
proper repression of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) during effector
differentiation. The inappropriate expression of IFN-gamma by Zbtb7b-deficient
CD4+ T cells required the activities of Eomesodermin and Runx transcription
factors. Runx activity was needed for Granzyme B expression, indicating that Runx
proteins control expression of the cytotoxic program. We conclude that a key
function of Zbtb7b in the mature CD4+ T cell compartment is to repress
CD8-lineage gene expression.

CD4 and the transcription factor ThPOK are essential for the differentiation of
major histocompatibility complex class II-restricted thymocytes into the helper T
cell lineage; their genes (Cd4 and Zbtb7b (called 'ThPOK' here)) are repressed by
transcriptional silencer elements in cytotoxic T cells. The molecular mechanisms 
regulating expression of these genes during helper T cell lineage differentiation
remain unknown. Here we showed that inefficient upregulation of ThPOK, induced by
removal of the proximal enhancer from the ThPOK locus, resulted in the
transdifferentiation of helper lineage-specified cells into the cytotoxic T cell 
lineage. Furthermore, direct antagonism by ThPOK of the Cd4 and ThPOK silencers
generated two regulatory loops that initially inhibited Cd4 downregulation and
later stabilized ThPOK expression. Our results show how an initial
lineage-specification signal can be amplified and stabilized during the
lineage-commitment process.

2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) was reported to skew the lineage
commitment of thymocytes toward CD4(-)CD8+ T (CD8 T) cells. However, the
underlying mechanisms are not known. In the present study, we first demonstrated 
that the expression of transcription regulatory factors such as cKrox and Runx3, 
which have been shown to be intimately associated with the commitment of CD4+CD8+
double-positive (DP) to CD4 or CD8 single-positive (SP) thymocyes, was
down-regulated by TCDD in CD4 SP thymocytes, but up-regulated in DP, CD4+CD8+
double-negative (DN), and CD8 SP thymocytes. Then, we found that TCDD inhibited
the differentiation of DPK cells, an immature CD4+CD8+ lymphoma cell line, into
CD4+CD8(-) T cells, as well as the expression of cKrox and Runx3 upon antigen
stimulation. Co-treatment with the AhR antagonist alpha-naphthoflavone did not
completely block the inhibitory action of TCDD on DPK differentiation and the
expression of cKrox and Runx3 in DPK cells, suggesting that the immunomodulatory 
abilities of TCDD are produced, at least in part, independently of the AhR
pathway in DPK cells. Our findings could help in understanding the regulatory
mechanisms of TCDD on thymocyte development, in particular on the skewed
differentiation of DP into CD8 SP thymocytes.

Despite several investigations, the transcriptional mechanisms which regulate the
expression of both type I collagen genes (COL1A1 and COL1A2) in either
physiological or pathological situations, such as scleroderma, are not completely
known. In this study, we determined the effects of both native ichtyan
chondroïtin sulphate (CS) and its derived hydrolytic fragments (CSf) on human
normal (NF) and scleroderma (SF) fibroblasts. Here, we demonstrate for the first 
time that CS and CSf exert an inhibitory effect on type I collagen protein
synthesis and decrease the corresponding mRNA steady-state levels of COL1A1 and
COL1A2 in NF and SF. These glycosaminoglycan molecules repress COL1A1 gene
transcription through a -112/-61 bp sequence upstream the start site of
transcription and imply hc-Krox and Sp1 transcription factors. In addition, CS
and CSf induced a down-regulation of TbetaRI expression. As a conclusion, our
findings highlight a possible new role for CS and CSf as anti-fibrotic molecules 
and could help in elucidating the mechanisms of action by which CS and CSf exert 
their inhibitory effect on type I collagen synthesis.

The transcription factor Zbtb7b promotes CD4 expression by antagonizing
Runx-mediated activation of the CD4 silencer.

The persistence of CD4 expression is a key event distinguishing the
differentiation of MHC class II-restricted thymocytes into CD4 T cells from that 
of MHC class I-restricted thymocytes into CD8 T cells. The zinc finger
transcription factor Zbtb7b (or cKrox or Thpok) is normally expressed in MHC
class II-restricted thymocytes and promotes CD4 lineage choice. When expressed in
MHC class I-restricted cells, Zbtb7b redirects these cells from their normal CD8 
fate to CD4 differentiation, implying that it promotes, directly or not,
sustained CD4 expression; the present study has investigated the mechanism of
this effect. We demonstrate that, although Zbtb7b does not enhance CD4 expression
on its own, it antagonizes the CD4 repression mediated by the transcription
factor Runx3, which is normally up-regulated during CD8 differentiation and
promotes CD4 silencing. Zbtb7b also antagonizes CD4 repression by the related
protein Runx1, which is expressed in CD4 lineage cells. This antagonism is
observed both in vitro and in vivo, is transcriptional, and requires domains of
Zbtb7b that are essential to its ability to promote CD4 differentiation in vivo. 
Furthermore, Zbtb7b fails to antagonize Runx in cells treated with histone
deacetylase inhibitors, suggesting that Zbtb7b acts by reducing the expression of
thus far unknown factors that cooperate with Runx molecules to repress CD4. These
findings demonstrate that the transcription factor Zbtb7b promotes CD4 expression
by antagonizing Runx-mediated CD4 repression.

Despite several investigations, the transcriptional mechanisms that regulate the 
expression of both type I collagen genes (COL1A1 and COL1A2) in either
physiological or pathological situations, such as scleroderma, are not completely
known. We have investigated the role of hc-Krox transcription factor on type I
collagen expression by human dermal fibroblasts. hc-Krox exerted a stimulating
effect on type I collagen protein synthesis and enhanced the corresponding mRNA
steady-state levels of COL1A1 and COL1A2 in foreskin fibroblasts (FF), adult
normal fibroblasts (ANF), and scleroderma fibroblasts (SF). Forced hc-Krox
expression was found to up-regulate COL1A1 transcription through a -112/-61-bp
sequence in FF, ANF, and SF. Knockdown of hc-Krox by short interfering RNA and
decoy strategies confirmed the transactivating effect of hc-Krox and decreased
substantially COL1A1 transcription levels in all fibro-blast types. The
-112/-61-bp sequence bound specifically hc-Krox but also Sp1 and CBF. Attempts to
elucidate the potential interactions between hc-Krox, Sp1, and Sp3 revealed that 
all of them co-immunoprecipitate from FF cellular extracts when a c-Krox antibody
was used and bind to the COL1A1 promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays.
Moreover, hc-Krox DNA binding activity to its COL1A1-responsive element is
increased in SF, cells producing higher amounts of type I collagen compared with 
ANF and FF. These data suggest that the regulation of COL1A1 gene transcription
in human dermal fibroblasts involves a complex machinery that implicates at least
three transcription proteins, hc-Krox, Sp1, and Sp3, which could act in concert

The Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat has a spontaneous mutation, T helper
immunodeficiency (thid), which causes a markedly reduced CD4(+) thymocyte
population. Here we positionally clone the locus and identify a deletion in the
gene encoding a receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase kappa (Ptprk) that led
to complete loss of the transcript. The rat Ptprk gene exhibits 98% identity with
the human and mouse counterparts and is expressed most abundantly in the
CD4(-)CD8(-) double-negative stage. The downregulation of Ptprk in mouse immature
thymocytes by RNA interference mimicked the thid phenotype. These results
indicate that thid maps to the Ptprk locus and that functional Ptprk is crucial
for lineage commitment or progression of CD4(+) T cells. We also found that Ptprk
appears to function in parallel with or downstream of Th-POK/cKrox (also known as
ZBTB7B), a master regulator of T cell lineage decision.

Chondrocyte glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis is regulated by the availability of
UDP-glucuronate, the substrate of glucuronosyl transferases which form the GAG
chains in proteoglycans and hyaluronan. UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UDPGD) is
therefore a key enzyme in the synthesis of UDP-glucuronate from glucose. However,
the mechanisms regulating its expression in chondrocytes are not fully
understood. We investigated the effect of c-Krox, a zinc-finger transcription
factor previously shown to modulate several matrix genes, on the synthesis of GAG
and transcriptional activity of several UDPGD gene promoter constructs, using
transient transfection and decoy experiments in rabbit articular chondrocytes
(RACs). We show that overexpression of c-Krox inhibits radiosulfate incorporation
into neosynthesized GAG and that the effect was mediated by a cis-sequence
located between +18 and +39bp of the UDPGD gene. Since that sequence can also
bind Sp1/Sp3 factors, it is likely that c-Krox acts in concert with these
proteins to modulate the UDPGD gene expression in articular chondrocytes.

The transcription factor cKrox was originally identified as a protein that bound 
to a negative transcription regulatory element in the murine alpha1(I) collagen
promoter. We recently reported the cloning and characterization of human cKrox
(hcKrox). Overexpression of hcKrox in NIH3T3 fibroblasts efficiently repressed
the promoters of the fibronectin and alpha1(I) collagen genes (70-90%) in
transient transfection assays and suppressed the endogenous genes in hcKrox
expressing permanent cell lines. We have now isolated genomic clones and cDNAs
encoding two novel transcription factors related to hcKrox termed hcKrox-beta and
hcKrox-gamma (the original clone is now referred to as hcKrox-alpha). Both
contain three kruppel-like zinc-finger DNA binding motifs that are 71-78%
identical to those of hcKrox-alpha. The NH(2)-terminus of all three proteins
contains a POZ domain, a conserved 120 amino acid motif involved in
transcriptional repression and protein dimerization. RT-PCR experiments
demonstrate that all three hcKrox family members are expressed in foreskin and
dermal fibroblasts. Transient transfection studies in NIH3T3 fibroblasts
demonstrate that hcKrox-alpha -beta and -gamma, as well as the murine cKrox-beta 
homologue, LRF, suppress transcription driven by promoters for the alpha1(I) and 
alpha2(I) collagen, fibronectin and elastin genes. Electrophoretic mobility shift
assays and coimmunoprecipitation studies suggest that homo- and
heterodimerization occurs between cKrox family members. Dimer formation is
influenced by amino acids in the NH(2)-terminal POZ domain and the Zn(+2)-finger 
region. Immunoprecipitation studies indicate that cKrox can form heterodimers in 
solution in the absence of DNA. Thus, a multi-gene family exists that can
coordinately regulate several extracellular matrix genes and has the potential to
form many heterodimeric transcription factors.

To identify control motifs involved in human type II collagen gene transcription 
in both differentiated and dedifferentiated rabbit articular chondrocytes,
transient transfection experiments were performed. A 715-base pair (bp) region of
the first intron (+2127/+2842), including a 153-bp sequence so far
uncharacterized (+2689/+2842), was found to mediate enhancer activity. In
dedifferentiated chondrocytes, this enhancer activity was shown to be less
effective than in primary cultures but still present. We then demonstrated that a
zinc finger protein, C-Krox, activates COL2A1 gene transcription in
differentiated chondrocytes through the enhancer region, whereas in subcultured
cells, it inhibited the gene activity via a 266-bp promoter. Multicopies of the
C-Krox binding site were found to mediate transactivation in both primary
cultures and passaged cells, whereas C-Krox overexpression inhibited
transcription in dedifferentiated chondrocytes. Additionally, we showed that
C-Krox binds to several cis sequences that mediate its transcriptional effects.
During chondrocyte dedifferentiation, the protein levels and binding activity of 
C-Krox were reduced, whereas those of NF-kappaB were increased. This was not
associated with variations of mRNA levels, suggesting that post-transcriptional
regulatory mechanisms could be involved in C-Krox expression. These results
suggest that C-Krox plays a major role in type II collagen expression and the
chondrocyte phenotype modulation.

Previous studies suggest that there may be species differences in the utilization
of cis-elements of the type I collagen genes. The present study was designed to
examine this possibility by focusing on two regions of the proalpha1(I) collagen 
promoter. One is the GC-rich A1 region (-194/168) that modulates transcriptional 
activity of the mouse promoter. The other contains a glucocorticoid response
element (GRE) implicated in negative glucocorticoid regulation of the rat
promoter. Unlike mouse A1 probes, probes representing the analogous human
(-195/-168) and rat (-193/-179) regions failed to bind nuclear proteins in gel
shift assays. Binding assays with mouse A1 probes containing base substitutions
indicated that this behavior could be ascribed to five bases in the human, and
two in the rat sequences. In addition, the pattern of expression of c-Krox, a
protein that alters transcriptional activity via the mouse A1 element, differed
in mouse and human tissues. Computer analysis revealed differences in the
arrangement of GRE half-sites in human and rat proalpha1(I) collagen promoters.
In a region of the human promoter (-700/673) analogous to the rat (-672/-633),
there are three half-sites, each separated by two nucleotides, that cooperate in 
binding of glucocorticoid receptor. There also is a proximal half-site at
position -335 of the human promoter that binds glucocorticoid receptor, but it is
not present in the rat promoter. This study has defined several species-specific 
differences in the sequences and nuclear protein binding activity of regions
involved in transcriptional activity of the proalpha1(I) collagen promoter. The
results suggest that the A1 regions of the human and rat promoters examined here 
are unlikely to function as regulatory cis-elements, and they provide a framework
for investigating the role of GREs in transcriptional regulation. They also
suggest that species differences in cis-elements and transcription factors should
be taken into consideration when using heterologous systems to study collagen
gene regulation.

The transcriptional regulation of human biglycan expression under normal and
pathological conditions was studied. The 5'-flanking regions of the human and
mouse genes were isolated and analyzed; the two promoter regions share 81%
identity. Both promoters are without a TATA and CAT box and contain multiple Sp1 
sites. Human dermal fibroblasts were transiently transfected with progressive
deletional human biglycan 5'-flanking DNA-CAT constructs, and a significant
variation in activity among the individual constructs was found. A small deletion
in several cases caused a more than 2-fold increase or decrease in promoter
activity, thereby mapping the target sites for repressors or activators. Human
biglycan expression is reduced in females with Ullrich-Turner syndrome (45,X) and
increased in individuals with supernumerary sex chromosomes, and it has been
speculated that biglycan plays a role in the short stature phenotype of Turner
syndrome. Analysis of the transcriptional regulation of biglycan in individuals
with sex chromosome anomalies showed that a -262 to -218 region of the biglycan
promoter was differentially regulated. This region was extensively analyzed by
DNAse footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and a putative
binding site for the transcription factor c-Krox was discovered. The binding of
c-Krox to a site located at approximately -248 to -230 in the human biglycan
promoter was confirmed by using extracts from COS cells expressing recombinant
human c-Krox. The expression of c-Krox in bone was then examined by
reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction and Northern blotting analysis; an 
approximately 3.4 kb transcript was detected in primary osteoblastic cells, in
MG-63 cells, and in human bone marrow stromal cells. This is the first detection 
of c-Krox in bone cells, and it suggests that c-Krox, like another member of the 
Krox family, Krox-20, might play a regulatory role in bone.

cKrox is a novel zinc finger-containing transcription factor that binds to the
alpha1(I) and alpha2(I) collagen gene promoters. The gene coding for cKrox is a
new member of a family of early growth response genes, that play important roles 
in development. In the mouse, cKrox is expressed, beginning at 9.5 days of
gestation and at 10.5 days in regions destined to become skin. In adult animals, 
expression is predominantly in skin, one of the two major organs where type I
collagen is expressed. We have isolated cDNA clones for human cKrox. Theoretical 
translation of the nucleic acid sequence reveals 90% conservation of amino acids 
between the mouse and human proteins; however, the human gene product contains a 
117-amino-acid N-terminal extension. The amino acid sequences of the zinc-finger 
DNA binding domains of mouse and human cKrox are identical. RT-PCR analysis of
human fibroblasts indicates constitutive low-level expression of cKrox which can 
be transiently elevated by treatment with retinoic acid. Transient transfection
assays indicate that hcKrox represses transcription of the alpha1(I) procollagen 
promoter, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that hcKrox binds
to both the human and murine promoter DNA. Deletion derivatives of hcKrox
demonstrate transcription-activating potential that is promoter-dependent. NIH3T3
cells permanently expressing hcKrox demonstrate a threefold and 10-fold decrease 
in alpha1(I) procollagen and fibronectin mRNA levels, respectively, compared to
control cells. Consistent with this finding, a fibronectin promoter reporter
construct is repressed more than 80% by hcKrox. These data suggest that hcKrox
represses collagen transcription directly, and it may function as a repressor of 
fibronectin and possibly other matrix genes.
