Forkhead box (FOX) transcription factor family plays an important role in cancer 
growth and metastasis. This study aimed to determine the predictive ability of
FOX genes in gastric carcinoma. A total of 360 patients with gastric from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohorts were collected in this study. The expression
profile of FOX family were obtained from the TCGA RNAseq database.
Clinicopathological characteristics, including age, gender, tumor node metastasis
(TNM), tumor grade, and overall survival were collected. Univariate and
multivariate Cox proportional hazards model were used to assess the risk factors 
for survival, and the results were further validated in in-house cohort. In the
TCGA cohort, FOXO4 (HR = 0.613, 95%CI 0.452-0.832) and FOXD3 (HR = 1.704, 95%CI
1.212-2.397) were shown independently predictive of overall survival in gastric
cancer after Cox proportional hazards analysis. The finding was validated in our 
in-house cohort, which demonstrated that both FOXO4 and FOXD3 were independent
predictors for overall survival (FOXO4 high, HR: 0.445, 95%CI 0.277-0.715, P =
0.001, FOXD3 high, HR: 1.927, 95%CI 1.212-3.063, P = 0.006) and disease free
survival (FOXO4 high, HR: 0.628, 95%CI 0.420-0.935, P = 0.022, FOXD3 high, HR:
1.698, 95%CI 1.136-2.540, P = 0.010).Collectively, FOX family paly critical roles
in gastric cancer, and FOXO4 and FOXD3 were identified as independent prognostic 
factors for survival outcomes of gastric cancer. Further functional study is
needed to understand more about FOX family in gastric cancer.

BACKGROUND: The dorsal midline region of the neural tube that results from
closure of the neural folds is generally termed the roof plate (RP). However,
this domain is highly dynamic and complex, and is first transiently inhabited by 
prospective neural crest (NC) cells that sequentially emigrate from the
neuroepithelium. It only later becomes the definitive RP, the dorsal midline
cells of the spinal cord. We previously showed that at the trunk level of the
axis, prospective RP progenitors originate ventral to the premigratory NC and
progressively reach the dorsal midline following NC emigration. However, the
molecular mechanisms underlying the end of NC production and formation of the
definitive RP remain virtually unknown.
RESULTS: Based on distinctive cellular and molecular traits, we have defined an
initial NC and a subsequent RP stage, allowing us to investigate the mechanisms
responsible for the transition between the two phases. We demonstrate that in
spite of the constant production of BMP4 in the dorsal tube at both stages, RP
progenitors only transiently respond to the ligand and lose competence shortly
before they arrive at their final location. In addition, exposure of dorsal tube 
cells at the NC stage to high levels of BMP signaling induces premature RP
traits, such as Hes1/Hairy1, while concomitantly inhibiting NC production.
Reciprocally, early inhibition of BMP signaling prevents Hairy1 mRNA expression
at the RP stage altogether, suggesting that BMP is both necessary and sufficient 
for the development of this RP-specific trait. Furthermore, when Hes1/Hairy1 is
misexpressed at the NC stage, it inhibits BMP signaling and downregulates
BMPR1A/Alk3 mRNA expression, transcription of BMP targets such as Foxd3,
cell-cycle progression, and NC emigration. Reciprocally, Foxd3 inhibits Hairy1,
suggesting that repressive cross-interactions at the level of, and downstream
from, BMP ensure the temporal separation between both lineages.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, our data suggest that BMP signaling is important both for 
NC and RP formation. Given that these two structures develop sequentially, we
speculate that the longer exposure of RP progenitors to BMP compared with that of
premigratory NC cells may be translated into a higher signaling level in the
former. This induces changes in responsiveness to BMP, most likely by
downregulating the expression of Alk3 receptors and, consequently, of
BMP-dependent downstream transcription factors, which exhibit spatial
complementary expression patterns and mutually repress each other to generate
alternative fates. This molecular dynamic is likely to account for the transition
between the NC and definitive RP stages and thus be responsible for the
segregation between central and peripheral lineages during neural development.

We compared apparent origins, cellular diversity and regulation of initial axon
growth for differentiating cranial sensory neurons. We assessed the molecular and
cellular composition of the developing olfactory and otic placodes, and cranial
sensory ganglia to evaluate contributions of ectodermal placode versus neural
crest at each site. Special sensory neuron populations-the olfactory and otic
placodes, as well as those in vestibulo-acoustic ganglion- are entirely populated
with cells expressing cranial placode-associated, rather than neural
crest-associated markers. The remaining cranial sensory ganglia are a mosaic of
cells that express placode-associated as well as neural crest-associated markers.
We found two distinct populations of neural crest in the cranial ganglia: the
first, as expected, is labeled by Wnt1:Cre mediated recombination. The second is 
not labeled by Wnt1:Cre recombination, and expresses both Sox10 and FoxD3. These 
populations-Wnt1:Cre recombined, and Sox10/Foxd3-expressing- are proliferatively 
distinct from one another. Together, the two neural crest-associated populations 
are substantially more proliferative than their placode-associated counterparts. 
Nevertheless, the apparently placode- and neural crest-associated populations are
similarly sensitive to altered signaling that compromises cranial morphogenesis
and differentiation. Acute disruption of either Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) or
Retinoic acid (RA) signaling alters axon growth and cell death, but does not
preferentially target any of the three distinct populations. Apparently, mosaic
derivation and diversity of precursors and early differentiating neurons,
modulated uniformly by local signals, supports early cranial sensory neuron
differentiation and growth.

We developed buffalo embryonic stem cell lines from somatic cell nuclear transfer
derived blastocysts, produced by hand-guided cloning technique. The inner cell
mass of the blastocyst was cut mechanically using a Microblade and cultured onto 
feeder cells in buffalo embryonic stem (ES) cell culture medium at 38°C in a 5%
CO2 incubator. The stem cell colonies were characterized for alkaline phosphatase
activity, karyotype, pluripotency and self-renewal markers like OCT4, NANOG,
SOX2, c-Myc, FOXD3, SSEA-1, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81 and CD90. The cell lines
also possessed the capability to differentiate across all the three germ layers
under spontaneous differentiation conditions.

Numerous studies in chordates and arthropods currently indicate that Cdx proteins
have a major ancestral role in the organization of post-head tissues. In
urochordate embryos, Cdx loss-of-function has notably been shown to impair axial 
elongation, neural tube (NT) closure and pigment cell development. Intriguingly, 
in contrast to axial elongation and NT closure, a Cdx role in neural crest
(NC)-derived melanocyte/pigment cell development has not been reported in any
other chordate species. To address this, we generated a new conditional pan-Cdx
functional knockdown mouse model that allows circumventing Cdx functional
redundancy as well as the early embryonic lethality of Cdx mutants. Through
directed inhibition in the neuroectoderm, we here provide in vivo evidence that
murine Cdx proteins impact melanocyte and enteric nervous system development via,
at least in part, directly controlling the expression of the key early regulators
of NC ontogenesis Pax3, Msx1 and FoxD3. Our work thus reveals a novel role for
the Cdx proteins atop of the trunk NC-gene regulatory network in the mouse, which
appears to be inherited from their ancestral orthologue.

Nanog is a pluripotency-related factor. It was also found to play an important
role in tumorigenesis. To date, the mechanisms underlying cervical tumorigenesis 
still need to be elucidated. In the present study, Nanog mRNA was synthesized
in vitro and transfected into HeLa cells. After mRNA transfection, the forced
expressed of Nanog in HeLa cells led to markedly increased invasion, migration,
resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and dedifferentiation. In a subcutaneous
xenograft assay, these cells had significantly increased tumorigenic capacity.
Real-time PCR indicated that Nanog-induced dedifferentiation was associated with 
increased expression of endogenous Oct4, Sox2 and FoxD3. In addition, the
dedifferentiated HeLa cells acquired features associated with cancer stem cells
(CSCs), such as multipotent differentiation capacity, and expression of CSC
markers such as CD133. These data imply that Nanog is a positive regulator of
cervical cancer dedifferentiation.

BACKGROUND: Although the chemopreventive effects of aspirin have been extensively
investigated, the roles of many cell components, such as long non-coding RNAs, in
these effects are still not completely understood.
RESULTS: We identify an aspirin-induced upregulated lncRNA, OLA1P2, in human
colorectal cancer. Aspirin induces demethylation of the FOXD3 promoter and
promotes expression of the FOXD3 gene. Subsequently, upregulated FOXD3 protein
transcriptionally activates lncRNA OLA1P2 expression. OLA1P2 upregulation
markedly affects STAT3 signaling pathway activity by inhibiting the nuclear
import of phosphorylated STAT3. The phosphorylation of tyrosine-705 of STAT3 is
the first step in OLA1P2 binding, and the formation of phosphorylated STAT3
homodimers is subsequently blocked. OLA1P2 interacts directly with STAT3 due to
OLA1P2 sharing the same conservative STAT3 transcription response element as
STAT3 targets. Regular use of aspirin dramatically decreases the number of
metastatic nodules of cancer cells in immunodeficient mouse lungs, and OLA1P2
silencing markedly weakens the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin in the lungs. 
Additionally, low OLA1P2 levels are associated with malignant transformation and 
lower overall survival in cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study finds that the aspirin-FOXD3-OLA1P2-STAT3 axis
exhibits exciting anticancer effects and provides new insights into the
chemopreventive mechanisms underlying aspirin use.

Following implantation, mouse epiblast cells transit from a naive to a primed
state in which they are competent for both somatic and primordial germ cell (PGC)
specification. Using mouse embryonic stem cells as an in vitro model to study the
transcriptional regulatory principles orchestrating
peri-implantation development, here we show that the transcription factor Foxd3
is necessary for exit from naive pluripotency and progression to a primed
pluripotent state. During this transition, Foxd3 acts as a repressor that
dismantles a significant fraction of the naive pluripotency expression program
through decommissioning of active enhancers associated with key naive
pluripotency and early germline genes. Subsequently, Foxd3 needs to be silenced
in primed pluripotent cells to allow re-activation of relevant genes required for
proper PGC specification. Our findings therefore uncover a cycle of activation
and deactivation of Foxd3 required for exit from naive pluripotency and
subsequent PGC specification.

Early development is governed by the ability of pluripotent cells to retain the
full range of developmental potential and respond accurately to developmental
cues. This property is achieved in large part by the temporal and contextual
regulation of gene expression by enhancers. Here, we evaluated regulation of
enhancer activity during differentiation of embryonic stem to epiblast cells and 
uncovered the forkhead transcription factor FOXD3 as a major regulator of the
developmental potential of both pluripotent states. FOXD3 bound to distinct sites
in the two cell types priming enhancers through a dual-functional mechanism. It
recruited the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex ATPase BRG1 to promote
nucleosome removal while concurrently inhibiting maximal activation of the same
enhancers by recruiting histone deacetylases1/2. Thus, FOXD3 prepares cognate
genes for future maximal expression by establishing and simultaneously repressing
enhancer activity. Through switching of target sites, FOXD3 modulates the
developmental potential of pluripotent cells as they differentiate.

Neural crest (NC)-derived stem cells (NCSC) have an exceptionally wide
differentiation potential, but their use in regenerative therapy has been
hampered by their scarcity in adult tissues and complex isolation protocols.
Human oral mucosal gingiva may provide an attractive source of these cells as it 
contains NC-derived cells, the tissue is easily accessible and wound healing is
fast and scarless with very little morbidity. To this end, we first investigated 
whether NC-derived cells are retained in adult gingiva by examining 8-months-old 
NC-reporter Wnt1-Cre/R26RYFP mice. We then hypothesised that gingival cell
NC-like phenotype can be further enhanced by floating neurosphere cultures
generated from standard human gingival fibroblast (GF) and pooled CFU-F (GSC)
cultures. Findings showed that NC-derived cells are retained in the gingival
connective tissue of aged mice. Human GFs and GSCs expressed NC-related genes
nestin, Snai1, Twist1, Pax3, Sox9 and FoxD3, and generated neurospheres. This was
mediated via calcium- and connexin 43-dependent cell communication, which is
similar to neurospheres formed by neural progenitors. Cells in the spheres showed
significantly increased expression of NC-related genes, and down regulation of
fibroblast-related type I collagen. Structurally, the neurospheres were polarised
with nestin positive cells located on the outer layers underlined with an
extracellular matrix rich in molecules typical to embryonic NC. Sphere-derived
cells expressed significantly elevated levels of neural markers, and
differentiated into Tau, neurofilament-M and GFAP-positive cells suggesting
neural differentiation potential. Thus, human GF and GSC cultures may provide an 
efficient source of NC-derived cells via enrichment by floating sphere cultures.

STUDY QUESTION: Can bioinformatics analysis of publically available microarray
datasets be utilized in identifying potentially important transcription factors
(TF) in the hormonal regulation of the endometrium?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Systems integration and analysis of existing complex (published) 
datasets, predicted a role for the novel transcription factor, Forkhead Box D3
(FOXD3) in healthy endometrium and in endometriosis, which was followed by the
demonstration of decreased levels of the protein upon decidualisation of normal
human endometrial stromal cells in vitro and differential endometrial expression 
in the stroma in endometriosis.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The reported endometriosis-associated endometrial
aberrations are most pronounced in the progesterone-dominant secretory phase and 
progesterone resistance is a proposed causative factor.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study was initially an 'in silico' study, with 
confirmatory 'wet lab' data from western blotting (WB), qPCR and
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on endometrial biopsies obtained from 142 women
undergoing gynaecological surgery.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The study was conducted at a University
Research Institute. Bioinformatic analysis of selected published microarray
datasets identified differentially regulated genes for the early and
mid-secretory phases relative to the proliferative phase. Diseases and Functions 
categories were identified with Ingenuity (IPA) 'core analysis' software. The key
transcription factors controlling secretory phase gene changes were revealed with
oPOSSUM software. FOXD3 expression levels were examined in human endometrial
samples from women aged 18-55 years by WB, IHC, and qPCR. The progesterone
regulation of endometrial FOXD3 levels was examined in vivo and in cultured
primary human endometrial stromal cells in vitro.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Initial data mining and subsequent
bioinformatics analysis of human endometrial microarray datasets identified FOXD3
to be a key regulator of gene expression specific to secretory
phase/endometriosis. FOXD3 was dynamically expressed in healthy endometrium and
differentially expressed in endometriosis. In vitro decidualisation of primary
endometrial stromal cells significantly decreased FOXD3 protein (P = 0.0005) and 
progestagen (Levonorgestrel) treatment also reduced the high endometrial FOXD3
protein (P = 0.0001) and mRNA levels (P = 0.04) seen in untreated women with
endometriosis, with a shift of FOXD3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The quality of Bioinformatics analysis and

WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: An in depth analysis of FOXD3 function and
its relationship with estrogen and progesterone might provide insights into its
potential deregulation in proliferative disorders of the endometrium including
endometrial cancer where its expression is also deregulated. Further, FOX
transcription factors are increasingly seen as novel therapeutic targets in
disease.

Differences between the left and right sides of the brain are found throughout
the animal kingdom, but the consequences of altered neural asymmetry are not well
understood. In the zebrafish epithalamus, the parapineal is located on the left
side of the brain where it influences development of the adjacent dorsal
habenular (dHb) nucleus, causing the left and right dHb to differ in their
organization, gene expression, and connectivity. Left-right (L-R) reversal of
parapineal position and dHb asymmetry occurs spontaneously in a small percentage 
of the population, whereas the dHb develop symmetrically following experimental
ablation of the parapineal. The habenular region was previously implicated in
modulating fear in both mice and zebrafish, but the relevance of its L-R
asymmetry is unclear. We now demonstrate that disrupting directionality of the
zebrafish epithalamus causes reduced exploratory behavior and increased cortisol 
levels, indicative of enhanced anxiety. Accordingly, exposure to buspirone, an
anxiolytic agent, significantly suppresses atypical behavior. Axonal projections 
from the parapineal to the dHb are more variable when it is located on the right 
side of the brain, revealing that L-R reversals do not necessarily represent a
neuroanatomical mirror image. The results highlight the importance of directional
asymmetry of the epithalamus in the regulation of stress responses in zebrafish.

BACKGROUND: Francisella infection attenuates immune cell infiltration and
expression of selected pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to endogenous LPS, 
suggesting the bacteria is actively antagonizing at least some part of the
response to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) engagement. The ability of different
Francisella strains to inhibit the ability of E. coli LPS to induce a pulmonary
inflammatory response, as measured by gene expression profiling, was examined to 
define the scope of modulation and identify of inflammatory genes/pathways that
are specifically antagonized by a virulent F. tularensis infection.
RESULTS: Prior aerosol exposure to F. tularensis subsp. tularensis, but not the
live attenuated strain (LVS) of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica or F. novicida,
significantly antagonized the transcriptional response in the lungs of infected
mice exposed to aerosolized E. coli LPS. The response to E. coli LPS was not
completely inhibited, suggesting that the bacteria is targeting further
downstream of the TLR4 molecule. Analysis of the promotors of LPS-responsive
genes that were perturbed by Type A Francisella infection identified candidate
transcription factors that were potentially modulated by the bacteria, including 
multiple members of the forkhead transcription factor family (FoxA1, Foxa2,
FoxD1, Foxd3, Foxf2, FoxI1, Fox03, Foxq1), IRF1, CEBPA, and Mef2. The annotated
functional roles of the affected genes suggested that virulent Francisella
infection suppressed cellular processes including mRNA processing, antiviral
responses, intracellular trafficking, and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.
Surprisingly, despite the broad overall suppression of LPS-induced genes by
virulent Francisella, and contrary to what was anticipated from prior studies,
Type A Francisella did not inhibit the expression of the majority of LPS-induced 
cytokines, nor the expression of many classic annotated inflammatory genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, this analysis demonstrates clear differences in the
ability of different Francisella strains to modulate TLR4 signaling and
identifies genes/pathways that are specifically targeted by virulent Type A
Francisella.

Development in Zebrafish.

Growth-arrest-specific 7 (Gas7) is preferentially expressed in the nervous system
and plays an important role during neuritogenesis in vertebrates. We recently
demonstrated that gas7 is highly expressed in zebrafish neurons, where it
regulates neural development. The possibility that gas7 may also regulate the
development of other tissues remains to be examined. In this study, we
investigate the role of Gas7 in the development of craniofacial tissues.
Knockdown of gas7 using morpholino oligomers produced abnormal phenotypes in
neural crest (NC) cells and their derivatives. NC-derived cartilage maturation
was altered in Gas7 morphants as revealed by aberrant sox9b and dlx2 expression, 
a phenotype that could be rescued by coinjection of gas7 mRNA. While rhombomere
morphology remained normal in Gas7 morphants, we observed reduced expression of
the prechondrogenic genes sox9b and dlx2 in cells populating the posterior
pharyngeal arches, but the fundamental structure of pharyngeal arches was
preserved. In addition, NC cell sublineages that migrate to form neurons, glial
cells, and melanocytes were altered in Gas7 morphants as revealed by aberrant
expression of neurod, foxd3, and mitfa, respectively. Development of NC
progenitors was also examined in Gas7 morphants at 12<U+2009>hpf, and we observed that
the reduction of cell precursors in Gas7 morphants was due to increased apoptosis
level. These results indicate that the formation of NC progenitors and
derivatives depends on Gas7 expression. Our observations also suggest that Gas7
regulates the formation of NC derivatives constituting the internal tissues of
pharyngeal arches, without affecting the fundamental structure of
mesodermal-derived pharyngeal arches.

The transcription factor forkhead box D3 (FOXD3), widely studied as a
transcriptional repressor in embryogenesis, participates in the carcinogenesis of
many cancers. However, the expression pattern and role of FOXD3 in non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) have not been well characterized. We report that FOXD3 is
significantly downregulated in NSCLC cell lines and clinical tissues. FOXD3
overexpression significantly inhibits cell growth and results in G1 cell cycle
arrest in NSCLC A549 and H1299 cells. In a xenograft tumor model, FOXD3
overexpression inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis. Remarkably, expression of 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was reduced in FOXD3 overexpression
models both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that FOXD3 plays a
potential tumor suppressor role in NSCLC progression and represents a promising
clinical prognostic marker and therapeutic target for this disease.

Test systems to identify developmental toxicants are urgently needed. A
combination of human stem cell technology and transcriptome analysis was to
provide a proof of concept that toxicants with a related mode of action can be
identified and grouped for read-across. We chose a test system of developmental
toxicity, related to the generation of neuroectoderm from pluripotent stem cells 
(UKN1), and exposed cells for 6 days to the histone deacetylase inhibitors
(HDACi) valproic acid, trichostatin A, vorinostat, belinostat, panobinostat and
entinostat. To provide insight into their toxic action, we identified HDACi
consensus genes, assigned them to superordinate biological processes and mapped
them to a human transcription factor network constructed from hundreds of
transcriptome data sets. We also tested a heterogeneous group of 'mercurials'
(methylmercury, thimerosal, mercury(II)chloride, mercury(II)bromide,
4-chloromercuribenzoic acid, phenylmercuric acid). Microarray data were compared 
at the highest non-cytotoxic concentration for all 12 toxicants. A support vector
machine (SVM)-based classifier predicted all HDACi correctly. For validation, the
classifier was applied to legacy data sets of HDACi, and for each exposure
situation, the SVM predictions correlated with the developmental toxicity.
Finally, optimization of the classifier based on 100 probe sets showed that eight
genes (F2RL2, TFAP2B, EDNRA, FOXD3, SIX3, MT1E, ETS1 and LHX2) are sufficient to 
separate HDACi from mercurials. Our data demonstrate how human stem cells and
transcriptome analysis can be combined for mechanistic grouping and prediction of
toxicants. Extension of this concept to mechanisms beyond HDACi would allow
prediction of human developmental toxicity hazard of unknown compounds with the
UKN1 test system.

CONTEXT: Vitiligo frequently coincides with autoimmune endocrinopathies,
particularly Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). Genetic susceptibility may underlie
this coincident occurrence. One candidate region is the autoimmunity
susceptibility locus on chromosome 1, which encompasses forkhead transcription
factor D3 (FoxD3), a gene involved in embryonal melanogenesis. We identified a
promotor variant (rs78645479) in an index case of vitiligo + HT + candidiasis and
evaluated its clinical and functional relevance.
DESIGN: We genotyped 281 patients with variable autoimmune endocrinopathies: HT, 
Graves' disease (GD), type 1 diabetes (T1D), Addison's disease (AD), autoimmune
polyglandular syndrome (APS), and/or vitiligo and 1858 controls. Furthermore, we 
experimentally assessed the effect of the variant on promotor activity and
assessed the expression of FoxD3 in human thyroid tissue samples.
RESULTS: Patients with vitiligo had a higher frequency of the risk allele (30%)
compared with healthy controls (18.2%). In addition, the variant was associated
with the incidence of elevated anti-TPO antibodies and anti-Tg antibodies, but
not with TSH, FT3, or FT4 levels and also not with GD, T1D, AD, or APS.
Functionally, the variant increased transcriptional activity in Jurkat and in
Hek293 cells. We confirmed gene expression of FoxD3 in human thyroid tissue,
which seemed elevated in thyroid tissue samples of some patients with GD and
nonautoimmune goiter but not in patients with HT.
CONCLUSION: In addition to a possible association of rs78645479 in FoxD3 with
vitiligo, our data on the association of this FoxD3 variant with thyroid
autoantibodies suggest a potential involvement of FoxD3 in thyroid
immunoregulation.

Axud1 Integrates Wnt Signaling and Transcriptional Inputs to Drive Neural Crest
Formation.

Neural crest cells are induced at the neural plate border by the combined action 
of transcription factors and signaling molecules. Here, we show that Axud1, a
downstream effector of Wnt signaling, represents a critical missing link that
integrates signaling and transcriptional cues to mediate neural crest formation. 
Axud1 is a transcription factor expressed in neural crest progenitors in a
Wnt1/ß-catenin-dependent manner. Axud1 loss leads to downregulation of multiple
genes involved in neural crest specification, similar to the effects of Wnt1
knockdown. Importantly, Axud1 is sufficient to rescue neural crest formation
after disruption of Wnt signaling. Furthermore, it physically interacts with
neural plate border genes Pax7 and Msx1 in vivo to directly activate
transcription of stem cell factor FoxD3, initiating the neural crest program.
Thus, Axud1 integrates Wnt signaling with transcriptional inputs to endow the
neural crest with its unique molecular signature.

FOXD3 Promotes PAX3 Expression in Melanoma Cells.

Several key transcription factors regulate cell growth, survival, and
differentiation during neural crest and melanoblast development in the embryo,
and these same pathways may be reactivated in tumors arising from the progenitors
of these cells. The transcription factors PAX3 and FOXD3 have essential roles in 
melanoblasts and melanoma. In this study, we define a regulatory pathway where
FOXD3 promotes the expression of PAX3. Both factors are expressed in melanoma
cells and there is a positive correlation between the transcript levels of PAX3
and FOXD3. The PAX3 gene contains two FOX binding motifs within highly conserved 
enhancer regulatory elements that are essential for neural crest development.
FOXD3 binds to both of these motifs in vitro but only one of these sites is
preferentially utilized in melanoma cells. Overexpression of FOXD3 upregulates
PAX3 levels while inhibition of FOXD3 function does not alter PAX3 protein
levels, supporting that FOXD3 is sufficient but not necessary to drive PAX3
expression in melanoma cells. Here, we identify a molecular pathway where FOXD3
upregulates PAX3 expression and therefore contributes to melanoma progression. J.

Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive and deadly disease. The chemokine receptor
CXCR4 is active in melanoma metastasis, although the mechanism for the promotion 
and maintenance of CXCR4 expression in these cells is mostly unknown. Here, we
find melanoma cells express two CXCR4 isoforms, the common version and a variant 
that is normally restricted to cells during development or to mature blood cells.
CXCR4 expression is driven through a highly conserved intronic enhancer element
by the transcription factors PAX3 and FOXD3. Inhibition of these transcription
factors slows melanoma cell growth, migration, and motility, as well as reduces
CXCR4 expression. Overexpression of these transcription factors drives the
production of increased CXCR4 levels. Loss of PAX3 and FOXD3 transcription factor
activity results in a reduction in cell motility, migration, and chemotaxis, all 
of which are rescued by CXCR4 overexpression. Here, we discover a molecular
pathway wherein PAX3 and FOXD3 promote CXCR4 gene expression in melanoma.

This study compared the efficiency of two embryo culture media (SOF1/SOF2 and
G1.2/G2.2) for pre- and post-implantation development of somatic cell nuclear
transfer goat embryos derived from non-transgenic and transgenic (for htPA and
hrcfIX genes) fibroblasts. Despite similar cleavage rates, G1.2/G2.2 supported
significantly higher blastocyst development than SOF1/SOF2 (30-35% versus 21%; P 
< 0.05), irrespective of cell transgenesis. However, following embryo transfer,
pregnancy outcomes (establishment, full-term development and live birth) were all
significantly higher (P < 0.05) for embryos developed in SOF1/SOF2 versus
G1.2/G2.2. Gene expression profiling of 17 developmentally important genes
revealed that: (i) SOX2, FOXD3, IFNT, FZD, FGFR4, ERK1, GCN5, PCAF, BMPR1, SMAD5,
ALK4, CDC25 and LIFR were significantly induced in blastocysts developed in
SOF1/SOF2 but not G1.2/G2.2; (ii) OCT4, CTNNB and CDX2 were similarly expressed
in both groups; and (iii) AKT was significantly higher in G1.2/G2.2 than
SOF1/SOF2 (P < 0.05). Following IVF, although blastocyst development in G1.2/G2.2
was significantly higher than SOF1/SOF2 counterparts, the majority of assessed
genes were similarly expressed in blastocysts developed in both groups. It was
concluded that the long-term programming effects of embryo culture medium and/or 
embryo production method may irreversibly affect post-implantation development of
cloned embryos through defined molecular pathways.

As a transcriptional repressor, forkhead box D3 (FOXD3) plays an important role
in tumorigenesis and progression of several tumors. However, the function and
methylation status of FOXD3 remain unknown in the progression of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we found that FOXD3 was decreased in HCC tissues 
and correlated with differentiation, AFP and poor survival of HCC patients
(p<0.05). Down-regulation of FOXD3 in HCC tissues was mainly due to promoter
hypermethylation. In vitro and in vivo functional results showed that ectopic
FOXD3 inhibited the proliferation, migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) and invasion in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells, and FOXD3 depletion in HepG2 and
QGY-7701 cells showed the adverse effects (p<0.05). Moreover, FOXD3 was
sufficient to suppress tumor growth and pulmonary metastatic potential in mice.
Our findings suggest that down-regulation of FOXD3, due to promoter
hypermethylation plays an important role in the progression of HCC and may be a
promising prognostic biomarker for HCC patients.

BACKGROUND: The transcription factor forkhead box D3 (FOXD3) plays important
roles in the development of neural crest and has been shown to suppress the
development of various cancers. However, the expression and its potential
biological roles of FOXD3 in high-grade gliomas (HGGs) remain unknown.
METHODS: The mRNA and protein expression levels of FOXD3 were examined using
real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting in 23 HGG and 13 normal brain
samples, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was used to validate the expression
FOXD3 protein in 184 HGG cases. The association between FOXD3 expression and the 
prognosis of HGG patients were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and
Cox proportional hazards regression models. In addition, we further examined the 
effects of FOXD3 on the proliferation and serum starvation-induced apoptosis of
glioma cells.
RESULTS: In comparison to normal brain tissues, FOXD3 expression was
significantly decreased in HGG tissues at both mRNA and protein levels.
Immunohistochemistry further validated the expression of FOXD3 in HGG tissues.
Moreover, low FOXD3 expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis
in HGG patients. Depletion of FOXD3 expression promoted glioma cell proliferation
and inhibited serum starvation-induced apoptosis, whereas overexpression of FOXD3
inhibited glioma cell proliferation and promoted serum starvation-induced
apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that FOXD3 might serve as an independent
prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for HGGs, which warrant
further investigation.

BACKGROUND: Population-based studies have demonstrated an association of single
nucleotide polymorphisms close to the thyroid transcription factor forkhead box
E1 (FOXE1) gene with thyroid cancer. The dysregulation of forkhead proteins is
increasingly recognized to play a role in the development and progression of
cancer. The objective of the study was to seek to identify novel mutations in
FOXE1 in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and to assess the effect of these
mutations on protein expression and transcriptional function on FOXE1 responsive 
promoters.
METHODS: The study was conducted at two tertiary referral hospitals. The coding
region of FOXE1 was sequenced in tissue-derived DNA or RNA from 120 patients with
PTC and 110 patients with multinodular goiter (MNG). In vitro studies were
performed to examine the protein expression and transcriptional function of FOXE1
mutants. A molecular model of the forkhead domain (FHD) of FOXE1 was generated
using the SWISS-MODEL online server with the three-dimensional structure of FOXD3
as a template.
RESULTS: Three somatic missense mutations were detected in PTC resulting in the
amino acid substitutions P54Q, K95Q, and L112F. One additional mutation was
detected in a MNG (G140R). In vitro studies demonstrated marked impairment in
transcriptional activation by all four FOXE1 mutants, which was not explained by 
differences in protein expression. Molecular modeling localized three of the
mutations to highly conserved regions of the FHD.
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified novel somatic mutations of FOXE1 in PTC.
Mutational inactivation of FOXE1 is an uncommon event in thyroid tumors but may
contribute to thyroid carcinogenesis and dedifferentiation in concert with other 
oncogenic drivers.

Tumor suppression function of FoxD3 in lung cancer.

Wang C(1), Huang Y, Dai W.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, NO. 38 Guangji Road,
Hangzhou, 310022, China.

INTRODUCTION: The transcription factor forkhead box D3 (FoxD3) is a forkhead
protein and serves as a transcriptional repressor. The functions of FoxD3 in
embryogenesis and in the development of neural crest cells have been diversely
studied. Its role associated with tumor development has attracted attention just 
in recent years. However, little is known about its regulation and functions in
the tumorigenesis and progression of lung cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We did a pioneer study to identify the function of FoxD3
in lung cancer by knocking down FoxD3 expression in lung adenocarcinoma cell
lines.
RESULTS: The result showed that silencing FoxD3 in lung cancer cell lines
stimulated cell growth and inhibited cell apoptosis. Through quantified PCR
analysis, we observed marked gene expression increase of insulin-like growth
factor receptor 1 and BRAF under the condition of FoxD3 silencing. In contrast,
cell cycle negative regulator P21 expression decreased after FoxD3 silencing.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to identify the tumor suppressor function of 
FoxD3 in lung cancer.

Here we report the successful generation and long-term expansion of
SOX9-expressing CD271(+)PDGFRa(+)CD73(+) chondrogenic ectomesenchymal cells from 
the PAX3/SOX10/FOXD3-expressing MIXL1(-)CD271(hi)PDGFRa(lo)CD73(-) neural
crest-like progeny of human pluripotent stem cells in a chemically defined medium
supplemented with Nodal/Activin/transforming growth factorß (TGFß) inhibitor and 
fibroblast growth factor (FGF). When "primed" with TGFß, such cells efficiently
formed translucent cartilage particles, which were completely mineralized in
12 weeks in immunocompromized mice. The ectomesenchymal cells were expandable
without loss of chondrogenic potential for at least 16 passages. They maintained 
normal karyotype for at least 10 passages and expressed genes representing
embryonic progenitors (SOX4/12, LIN28A/B), cranial mesenchyme (ALX1/3/4), and
chondroprogenitors (SOX9, COL2A1) of neural crest origin (SOX8/9, NGFR, NES).
Ectomesenchyme is a source of many craniofacial bone and cartilage structures.
The method we describe for obtaining a large quantity of human ectomesenchymal
cells will help to model craniofacial disorders in vitro and potentially provide 
cells for the repair of craniofacial damage.

Neural crest cells (NC) are a group of multipotent stem cells uniquely present in
vertebrates. They are destined to form various organs according to their
anterior-posterior (A-P) levels of origin in the neural tube (NT). They develop
into a wide spectrum of cell lineages under the influence of signaling cascades, 
neural plate border genes and NC specifier genes. Although this complex gene
regulatory network (GRN) specifies the fate of NC and the combinatory action of
Hox genes executed at the time of NC induction governs the patterning of NC for
the formation of specific structures along the A-P axis, not much information on 
how GRN and Hox genes directly interact and orchestrate is available. This review
summarizes recent findings on the multiple roles of Hoxb5 on the survival and
cell lineage differentiation of vagal and trunk NC cells during early
development, by direct transcriptional regulation of NC specifier genes (Sox9 and
Foxd3) of the GRN. We will also review findings on the transcriptional regulation
of Ret by Hoxb5 in the population of the vagal NC that are committed to the
enteric neuron and glia lineages. Functional redundancy between Hox proteins
(Hoxa5 and Hoxc5) from the same paralogue group as Hoxb5, and the cooperative
effects of Hox cofactors, collaborators and transcription factors in the Hoxb5
transcriptional regulation of target genes will also be discussed.

In vertebrates, pre-placodal ectoderm and neural crest development requires
morphogen gradients and several transcriptional factors, while the involvement of
histone modification remains unclear. Here, we report that histone-modifying
factors play crucial roles in the development of pre-placodal ectoderm and neural
crest in Xenopus. During the early neurula stage, PRDM12 was expressed in the
lateral pre-placodal ectoderm and repressed the expression of neural crest
specifier genes via methylation of histone H3K9. ChIP-qPCR analyses indicated
that PRDM12 promoted the occupancy of the trimethylated histone H3K9 (H3K9me3) on
the Foxd3, Slug, and Sox8 promoters. Injection of the PRDM12 MO inhibited the
expression of presumptive trigeminal placode markers and decreased the occupancy 
of H3K9me3 on the Foxd3 promoter. Histone demethylase Kdm4a also inhibited the
expression of presumptive trigeminal placode markers in a similar manner to
PRDM12 MO and could compensate for the effects of PRDM12. ChIP-qPCR analyses
revealed that promotion of the occupancy of H3K9me3 on the Foxd3, Slug, and Sox8 
promoters was inhibited by Kdm4a overexpression. Taken together, these data
indicate that histone modification was essential for pre-placodal ectoderm and
neural crest development.

Treatment of BRAF mutant melanomas with specific BRAF inhibitors leads to tumor
remission. However, most patients eventually relapse due to drug resistance.
Therefore, we designed an integrated strategy using (phospho)proteomic and
functional genomic platforms to identify drug targets whose inhibition sensitizes
melanoma cells to BRAF inhibition. We found many proteins to be induced upon
PLX4720 (BRAF inhibitor) treatment that are known to be involved in BRAF
inhibitor resistance, including FOXD3 and ErbB3. Several proteins were
down-regulated, including Rnd3, a negative regulator of ROCK1 kinase. For our
genomic approach, we performed two parallel shRNA screens using a kinome library 
to identify genes whose inhibition sensitizes to BRAF or ERK inhibitor treatment.
By integrating our functional genomic and (phospho)proteomic data, we identified 
ROCK1 as a potential drug target for BRAF mutant melanoma. ROCK1 silencing
increased melanoma cell elimination when combined with BRAF or ERK inhibitor
treatment. Translating this to a preclinical setting, a ROCK inhibitor showed
augmented melanoma cell death upon BRAF or ERK inhibition in vitro. These data
merit exploration of ROCK1 as a target in combination with current BRAF mutant
melanoma therapies.

In this study we describe the molecular and cellular characterization of a
zebrafish mutant that develops tumors in the optic pathway. Heterozygous
Tg(flk1:RFP)is18 transgenic adults develop tumors of the retina, optic nerve and 
optic tract. Molecular and genetic mapping demonstrate the tumor phenotype is
linked to a high copy number transgene array integrated in the lincRNA gene
lincRNAis18/Zv9_00007276 on chromosome 3. TALENs were used to isolate a 147 kb
deletion allele that removes exons 2-5 of the lincRNAis18 gene. Deletion allele
homozygotes are viable and do not develop tumors, indicating loss of function of 
the lincRNAis18 locus is not the trigger for tumor onset. Optic pathway tumors in
the Tg(flk1:RFP)is18 mutant occur with a penetrance of 80-100% by 1 year of age. 
The retinal tumors are highly vascularized and composed of rosettes of various
sizes embedded in a fibrous matrix. Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased
expression of the glial markers GFAP and BLBP throughout retinal tumors and in
dysplastic optic nerve. We performed transcriptome analysis of pre-tumorous
retina and retinal tumor tissue and found changes in gene expression signatures
of radial glia and astrocytes (slc1a3), activated glia (atf3, blbp, apoeb),
proliferating neural progenitors (foxd3, nestin, cdh2, her9/hes1), and glioma
markers (S100ß, vim). The transcriptome also revealed activation of cAMP, Stat3
and Wnt signal transduction pathways. qRT-PCR confirmed >10-fold overexpression
of the Wnt pathway components hbegfa, ascl1a, and insm1a. Together the data
indicate Müller glia and/or astrocyte-derived progenitors could contribute to the
zebrafish Tg(flk1:RFP)is18 optic pathway tumors.

Growth of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells Using Functional Human Extracellular
Matrix.

The use of animal products in the derivation and maintenance of human pluripotent
stem cells (hPSCs) limits their possible applications in research and in clinics.
Thus, one of the major goals in regenerative medicine is the establishment of
animal-free conditions to support the culture and differentiation of human stem
cells. Human fibroblasts produce an extracellular matrix (ECM) which can be
extracted without the use of detergents, sterilized, and then used to coat tissue
culture plates. We have shown that human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) grown on
this matrix maintain their pluripotency in the presence of medium conditioned by 
fibroblast cells, and that these cells maintain expression of surface proteins
(SSEA4, Tra1-60, Tra1-81), alkaline phosphatase activity, and specific
intracellular markers (Nanog, Oct-4, Tert, FoxD3) in hESCs. This growth system
reduces exposure of hPSCs to feeder layers and animal ingredients, thereby
limiting the risk of pathogenic contamination and additionally, facilitating
their manipulation. Herein we present an improved version of our previous
protocol for extracting ECM from human foreskin fibroblast using a different
buffer. Our new hypotonic shock method is detergent-free, reduces costs, and
preserves the integrity of the extracted ECM. This improved protocol has been
validated for undifferentiated-state hPSC maintenance (more than 40 passages),
stem cell differentiation, and for cell migration assays.

Pluripotency-associated transcription factor Foxd3 is required for maintaining
pluripotent cells. However, molecular mechanisms underlying its function are
largely unknown. Here, we report that Foxd3 suppresses differentiation induced by
calcineurin-NFAT signaling to maintain the ESC identity. Mechanistically, Foxd3
interacts with NFAT proteins and recruits co-repressor Tle4, a member of the Tle 
repressor family highly expressed in undifferentiated ESCs, to suppress NFATc3's 
transcriptional activities. Furthermore, global transcriptome analysis shows that
Foxd3 and NFATc3 co-regulate a set of differentiation-associated genes in ESCs.
Collectively, our study establishes a molecular and functional link between a
pluripotency-associated factor and an important ESC differentiation-inducing
pathway.

Neural crest specification and migration independently require NSD3-related
lysine methyltransferase activity.

Neural crest precursors express genes that cause them to become migratory,
multipotent cells, distinguishing them from adjacent stationary neural
progenitors in the neurepithelium. Histone methylation spatiotemporally regulates
neural crest gene expression; however, the protein methyltransferases active in
neural crest precursors are unknown. Moreover, the regulation of methylation
during the dynamic process of neural crest migration is unclear. Here we show
that the lysine methyltransferase NSD3 is abundantly and specifically expressed
in premigratory and migratory neural crest cells. NSD3 expression commences
before up-regulation of neural crest genes, and NSD3 is necessary for expression 
of the neural plate border gene Msx1, as well as the key neural crest
transcription factors Sox10, Snail2, Sox9, and FoxD3, but not gene expression
generally. Nevertheless, only Sox10 histone H3 lysine 36 dimethylation requires
NSD3, revealing unexpected complexity in NSD3-dependent neural crest gene
regulation. In addition, by temporally limiting expression of a dominant negative
to migratory stages, we identify a novel, direct requirement for NSD3-related
methyltransferase activity in neural crest migration. These results identify NSD3
as the first protein methyltransferase essential for neural crest gene expression
during specification and show that NSD3-related methyltransferase activity
independently regulates migration.

Emerging evidence suggests that Nanog is involved in cervical tumorigenesis.
However, the regulating role of Nanog in tumorigenesis and chemosensitivity are
still poorly understood. In this study, Nanog was disrupted by transcription
activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) in Hela cells and its expression was
significantly decreased in a single-cell derived sub-clone with biallelic
mutations. The disruption of Nanog not only induced down regulation of some other
core transcription factor genes for cell self-renewal, such as Oct4, Sox2 and
FoxD3, but also led to the down regulation of some mesenchymal representative
genes, vimentin and N-adherin, and up regulation of the epithelial gene,
E-cadherin. In addition, the invasiveness and clonogenicity of the Hela cells
were obviously affected, and surprisingly their sensitivities to anti-cancer
drugs were also significantly increased in vitro. After Xenograft into nude mice,
the growth volumes of the neoplasms from the Nanog disrupted Hela cells were
significantly smaller compared with those from wild type ones. In conclusion,
these results suggest that disruption of Nanog may reverse the status of
epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which is critical in tumorigenesis, and
alleviate chemoresistance, as well as their invasiveness, in cervical cancer
cells.

Patterning of neural crest (NC) for the formation of specific structures along
the anterio-posterior (A-P) body axis is governed by a combinatorial action of
Hox genes, which are expressed in the neuroepithelium at the time of NC
induction. Hoxb5 was expressed in NC at both induction and migratory stages, and 
our previous data suggested that Hoxb5 played a role in the NC development.
However, the underlying mechanisms by which Hoxb5 regulates the early NC
development are largely unknown. Current study showed that both the human and
mouse Foxd3 promoters were bound and trans-activated by Hoxb5 in NC-derived
neuroblastoma cells. The binding of Hoxb5 to Foxd3 promoter in vivo was further
confirmed in the brain and neural tube of mouse embryos. Moreover, Wnt1-Cre
mediated perturbation of Hoxb5 signaling at the dorsal neural tube in mouse
embryos resulted in Foxd3 down-regulation. In ovo, Foxd3 alleviated the apoptosis
of neural cells induced by perturbed Hoxb5 signaling, and Hoxb5 induced ectopic
Foxd3 expression in the chick neural tube. This study demonstrated that Hoxb5 (an
A-P patterning gene) regulated the NC development by directly inducing Foxd3 (a
NC specifier and survival gene).

INTRODUCTION: Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is a heterogeneous group of
pregnancy-related disorders. Hydatidiform mole (HM) is the most common type of
GTD, whereas gestational choriocarcinoma is the most aggressive. Non-receptor
tyrosine kinase c-Src contributes to the transformation to a malignant phenotype 
in various cancers. However, the role of c-Src in the pathogenesis of GTD remains
largely unknown.
METHODS: The expression level of phosphorylated c-Src was determined by
immunohistochemistry and Western blotting assay. JAR and JEG-3 cells were treated
with hCG, specific c-Src inhibitor saracatinib and PP2, and PKA specific
inhibitor, PKI. Cell growth rate and cell migration/invasion ability was
determined by cell proliferation and transwell assays respectively.
RESULTS: c-Src was highly activated in HM tissues and choriocarcinoma cells (JAR 
and JEG-3). c-Src was activated by hCG in a time and concentration-dependent
manner, which was abrogated by specific c-Src and PKA inhibitors. Inhibition of
c-Src activity in JAR and JEG-3 cells by saracatinib leaded to a decrease in the 
rate of cell growth and cell migration/invasion ability. Furthermore, inhibition 
of c-Src phosphorylation induced cell cycle arrest and reduced expressions of
cyclin A2, cyclin B1, cyclin E1, FOXD3 and NANOG. Moreover, inhibition of c-Src
activity resulted in decreased p-FAK(Tyr397) phosphorylation.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate an important role of c-Src in
the pathogenesis of GTD, and we propose that c-Src inhibitors are potential
adjuvant chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of GTD.

The neural crest is a multipotent, highly migratory cell population that gives
rise to diverse cell types, including melanocytes. Factors regulating the
development of the neural crest and emigration of its cells are likely to
influence melanoma metastasis. The transcription factor FOXD3 plays an essential 
role in premigratory neural crest development and has been implicated in melanoma
cell dormancy and response to therapeutics. FOXD3 is downregulated during the
migration of the melanocyte lineage from the neural crest, and our previous work 
supports a role for FOXD3 in suppressing melanoma cell migration and invasion.
Alternatively, TWIST1 is known to have promigratory and proinvasive roles in a
number of cancers, including melanoma. Using ChIP-seq analysis, TWIST1 was
identified as a potential transcriptional target of FOXD3. Mechanistically, FOXD3
directly binds to regions of the TWIST1 gene locus, leading to transcriptional
repression of TWIST1 in human mutant BRAF melanoma cells. In addition, depletion 
of endogenous FOXD3 promotes upregulation of TWIST1 transcripts and protein.
Finally, FOXD3 expression leads to a significant decrease in cell migration that 
can be efficiently reversed by the overexpression of TWIST1. These findings
uncover the novel interplay between FOXD3 and TWIST1, which is likely to be
important in the melanoma metastatic cascade.IMPLICATIONS: FOXD3 and TWIST1
define distinct subgroups of cells within a heterogeneous tumor.

Peripheral glia have a pivotal role in the initial response to axon degeneration 
of peripheral sensory neurons in zebrafish.

University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America.

Axon degeneration is a feature of many peripheral neuropathies. Understanding the
organismal response to this degeneration may aid in identifying new therapeutic
targets for treatment. Using a transgenic zebrafish line expressing a bacterial
nitroreductase (Ntr)/mCherry fusion protein in the peripheral sensory neurons of 
the V, VII, IX, and X cranial nerves, we were able to induce and visualize the
pathology of axon degeneration in vivo. Exposure of 4 days post fertilization Ntr
larvae to the prodrug metronidazole (Met), which Ntr metabolizes into cytotoxic
metabolites, resulted in dose-dependent cell death and axon degeneration. This
was limited to the Ntr-expressing sensory neurons, as neighboring glia and motor 
axons were unaffected. Cell death was rapid, becoming apparent 3-4 hours after
Met treatment, and was followed by phagocytosis of soma and axon debris by cells 
within the nerves and ganglia beginning at 4-5 hours of exposure. Although
neutrophils appear to be activated in response to the degenerating neurons, they 
did not accumulate at the sites of degeneration. In contrast, macrophages were
found to be attracted to the sites of the degenerating axons, where they
phagocytosed debris. We demonstrated that peripheral glia are critical for both
the phagocytosis and inflammatory response to degenerating neurons: mutants that 
lack all peripheral glia (foxD3-/-; Ntr) exhibit a much reduced reaction to
axonal degeneration, resulting in a dramatic decrease in the clearance of debris,
and impaired macrophage recruitment. Overall, these results show that this
zebrafish model of peripheral sensory axon degeneration exhibits many aspects
common to peripheral neuropathies and that peripheral glia play an important role
in the initial response to this process.

microRNAs, frequently deregulated in human cancer, have been implicated in the
progression of hepatocarcinogenesis. Here, we show that microRNA (miR)-137 is
significantly down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Its decreased
expression is associated with vein invasion, incomplete Involucrum, and distant
metastasis. Multivariate analysis suggests that miR-137 is an independent
indicator for poor survival. We next show that over-expression of miR-137
suppresses cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro. Conversely,
miR-137 inhibition promotes HCC cell growth. We also identify AKT2 as a key
target of miR-137 in this context. Statistical data reveal a reverse correlation 
of AKT2 and miR-137 expression in HCC patients. Silencing of AKT2 phenotypically 
copied miR-137-induced phenotypes, whereas re-expression of AKT2 reversed the
suppressive effects of miR-137. Further investigations showed that miR-137
exerted its anti-tumour activity via inhibiting the AKT2/mTOR pathway. Moreover, 
we demonstrate that FoxD3 directly binds to the promoter of miR-137 and activates
its transcription. In vivo studies confirm that FoxD3-regulated miR-137 inhibited
HCC growth and metastasis via targeting AKT2. Together, our findings indicate
that miR-137 is a valuable biomarker for HCC prognosis and the FoxD3/miR-137/AKT2
regulatory network plays an important role in HCC progression.

The transcription factor forkhead box D3 (FOXD3) plays an important role in the
development of neural crest and gastric cancer cells. However, the function and
mechanisms of FOXD3 in the breast tumorigenesis and progression is still limited.
Here, we report that FOXD3 is a tumor suppressor of breast cancer tumorigenicity 
and aggressiveness. We found that FOXD3 is down-regulated in breast cancer
tissues. Patients with low FOXD3 expression have a poor outcome. Depletion of
FOXD3 expression promotes breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion in vitro,
whereas overexpression of FOXD3 inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation and
invasion both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, depletion of FOXD3 is linked to 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like phenotype. Our results indicate
FOXD3 exhibits tumor suppressive activity and may be useful for breast therapy.

Efficient gene silencing in mesenchymal stem cells by substrate-mediated RNA
interference.

Hsu SH(1), Huang GS, Ho TT, Feng F.

Author information: 
(1)1 Institute of Polymer Science and Engineering, National Taiwan University ,
Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China .

We described a novel substrate-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) technology to
investigate the effect of neural crest marker expression on the multipotency of
human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs). HGFs showed significantly higher neural and
chondrogenic differentiation potentials compared with adult bone-marrow-derived
mesenchymal stem cells and stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth. By
sending target-specific RNAi agents with the conventional vehicle (PolyFect), we 
observed that the multipotency of HGFs was closely associated with the expression
of neural crest marker gene Forkhead box D3 (FoxD3). Using the novel chitosan
substrate-mediated method, we successfully delivered short-hairpin RNA constructs
to HGFs grown on chitosan without the use of conventional vehicles. The delivery 
efficiency measured by flow cytometry showed a 10-fold increase for HGFs on
chitosan versus those on culture dish, and the cell viability was >95%. Moreover,
HGFs with FoxD3 gene knockdown did not form spheroids on chitosan. Based on this 
working principle, we further selected the gene-silenced population from HGFs.
The nonsilenced HGFs showed much higher neural differentiation ability with the
nestin expression 40-fold greater than FoxD3-silenced population after induction,
suggesting the feasibility of the method to silence genes. The new
substrate-mediated gene silencing platform that combines the use of substrate and
RNAi can be used to clarify the functions of important genes without suffering
the toxicity.

An attempt was made to study the efficiency of chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)
egg extract (EE) to reprogram buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) foetal fibroblasts (bFFs)
without incorporation of ectopic transcription factors. The isolated bFFs were
cultured in media supplemented with 2%, 4%, 6% and 10% EE to induce
reprogramming. It was observed that fewer but larger sized alkaline phosphatase
positive (AP(+ve)) colonies developed in culture system containing 2% EE whereas,
more but smaller sized colonies developed in 4%, 6% and 10% EE. The developed
colonies expressed pluripotency markers like Oct4, Nanog, SSEA1, TRA-1-60,
TRA-1-81 and RT-PCR study revealed relative expression of genes indicating
pluripotency (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and FoxD3) increased as the concentration of EE
increased in culture systems confirming the reprogramming capability of chicken
EE.

Differential expression of transcription factors and inflammation-, ROS-, and
cell death-related genes in organotypic cultures in the modiolus, the organ of

Cells respond to injury and hypoxia by changing gene expression. To study how the
main compartments of the cochlea, the stria vascularis (SV), the organ of Corti
(OC), and the modiolus (MOD), respond to such stress, we analyzed the expression 
of selected genes using microarray analysis. Organotypic cultures of SV, OC, and 
MOD from newborn rats were used as an experimental model. In the present study,
we compare the expression of a total of 50 genes involved in apoptosis and
necrosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism, inflammation as well as
selected transcription factors (TF) and analyze their role for the different cell
death patterns observed in the three regions. MOD, OC, and SV differ not only in 
their basal gene profiles but also in their ability to respond to injury and
hypoxia. The results provide two coexpression clusters across the three regions, 
a Hif-1a coexpression cluster and a cluster around the cell death-associated
transcripts Casp3, Capn1, Capn2, and Capns1. These clusters include the TF Jun,
Bmyc, Nfyc, Foxd3, Hes1, the ROS-associated molecules Sod3, and Nos2, and the
inflammatory chemokine Ccl20. The evidence of both clusters indicates the complex
and regulated character of gene expression following injury and hypoxia across
the three regions SV, OC, and MOD. The high vulnerability of spiral ganglion
neurons in the MOD region, previously explained on the basis of the availability 
of neuro-trophic factors, is associated with the increased endogenous production 
of ROS and nitric oxide and inadequate activation of protective acting genes.

The scaffolding protein tetraspanin18 (Tspan18) maintains epithelial cadherin-6B 
(Cad6B) to antagonize chick cranial neural crest epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT). For migration to take place, Tspan18 must be downregulated.
Here, we characterize the role of the winged-helix transcription factor FoxD3 in 
the control of Tspan18 expression. Although we previously found that Tspan18 mRNA
persists several hours past the stage it would normally be downregulated in
FoxD3-deficient neural folds, we now show that Tspan18 expression eventually
declines. This indicates that while FoxD3 is crucial for initial downregulation
of Tspan18, other factors subsequently impact Tspan18 expression. Remarkably, the
classical EMT transcription factor Snail2 is not one of these factors. As in
other vertebrates, FoxD3 is required for chick cranial neural crest specification
and migration, however, FoxD3 has surprisingly little impact on chick cranial
neural crest cell survival. Strikingly, Tspan18 knockdown rescues FoxD3-dependent
neural crest migration defects, although neural crest specification is still
deficient. This indicates that FoxD3 promotes cranial neural crest EMT by
eliciting Tspan18 downregulation separable from its Tspan18-independent activity 
during neural crest specification and survival.

Downregulation of the transcription factor, FoxD3, is associated with lymph node 
metastases in invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast.

FoxD3 is a transcription factor of the forkhead gene family. We investigated its 
expression in invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC) of the breast and its association 
with metastasis. The expression of FoxD3, human epidermal growth factor
receptor-2 (HER-2), estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and Ki67
was examined by immunohistochemistry in samples from 121 patients with IDC.
Non-tumorous breast adenosis tissues served as controls. HER2 expression was
confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The expression levels of 
FoxD3 in IDC tissues and the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were
additionally measured by western blotting. A greater percentage of total IDC
patients and patients with lymph node metastases showed reduced FoxD3 expression 
compared to adenosis controls (p<0.05). Overall, FoxD3 was associated with
metastatic status of IDC but not with age, pathological or clinical staging, or
status of HER-2, ER, or PR. In particular, FoxD3 protein expression was
down-regulated in the tumor epithelia of IDC samples from patients with
metastases. Furthermore, FoxD3 protein expression was decreased in the metastatic
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line relative to the non-metastatic cell line,
MCF-7. A greater number of patients with invasive, triple-negative breast cancer 
were also negative for FoxD3 expression than in other, non-triple-negative tumor 
types. These results suggest an inverse relationship between FoxD3 expression and
tumor metastasis and warrants further investigation.

The transcription factor cMyb has well known functions in vertebrate
hematopoiesis, but little was known about its distribution or function at early
developmental stages. Here, we show that cMyb transcripts are present at the
neural plate during gastrulation in chick embryos. cMyb expression then resolves 
to the cranial neural folds and is maintained in early migrating cranial neural
crest cells during and after neurulation. Morpholino-mediated knock-down of cMyb 
reduces expression of Pax7 and Twist at the neural plate border, as well as
reducing expression of neural crest specifier gene Slug/Snail2 and completely
eliminating expression of Ets1. On the other hand, its loss results in abnormal
maintenance of Zic1, but little or no effect on other neural crest specifier
genes like FoxD3 or Sox9. These results place cMyb in a critical hierarchical
position within the cranial neural crest cell gene regulatory network, likely
directly inhibiting Zic1 and upstream of Ets1 and some, but not all, neural crest
specifier genes.

Dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) supplementation is postulated
to have positive effects on fertility. The impact of dietary n-3 PUFA
supplementation on physiological and biochemical processes involved in
reproduction is likely to be associated with significant alterations in gene
expression in key reproductive tissues which is in turn regulated by
transcription factors. Beef heifers were supplemented with a rumen protected
source of either a saturated fatty acid or high n-3 PUFA diet per animal per day 
for 45 days and uterine endometrial tissue was harvested post slaughter. A
microarray analysis was conducted and bioinformatic tools were employed to
evaluate the effect of n-3 PUFA supplementation on gene expression in the bovine 
endometrium. Clustering of microarray gene expression data was performed to
identify co-expressed genes. Functional annotation of each cluster of genes was
carried out using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Furthermore, oPOSSUM was employed
to identify transcription factors involved in gene expression changes due to
supplementary PUFA. Gene functions which showed a significant response to n-3
PUFA supplementation included tissue development, immune function and
reproductive function. Numerous transcription factors such as FOXD1, FOXD3,
NFKB1, ESR1, PGR, FOXA2, NKX3-1 and PPARa were identified as potential regulators
of gene expression in the endometrium of cattle supplemented with n-3 PUFA. This 
study demonstrates the complex nature of the alterations in the transcriptional
regulation process in the uterine endometrium of cattle following dietary
supplementation which may positively influence the uterine environment.

Heat shock factor binding protein 1 (HSBP1) is a 76 amino acid polypeptide that
contains two arrays of hydrophobic heptad repeats and was originally identified
through its interaction with the oligomerization domain of heat shock factor 1
(Hsf1), suppressing Hsf1's transcriptional activity following stress. To examine 
the function of HSBP1 in vivo, we generated mice with targeted disruption of the 
hsbp1 gene and examined zebrafish embryos treated with HSBP1-specific morpholino 
oligonucleotides. Our results show that hsbp1 is critical for preimplantation
embryonic development. Embryonic stem (ES) cells deficient in hsbp1 survive and
proliferate normally into the neural lineage in vitro; however, lack of hsbp1 in 
embryoid bodies (EBs) leads to disorganization of the germ layers and a reduction
in the endoderm-specific markers (such as a-fetoprotein). We further show that
hsbp1-deficient mouse EBs and knockdown of HSBP1 in zebrafish leads to an
increase in the expression of the neural crest inducers Snail2, Tfap2a and Foxd3,
suggesting a potential role for HSBP1 in the Wnt pathway. The hsbp1-deficient ES 
cells, EBs and zebrafish embryos with reduced HSBP1 levels exhibit elevated
levels of Hsf1 activity and expression of heat shock proteins (Hsps). We conclude
that HSBP1 plays an essential role during early mouse and zebrafish embryonic
development.

The neural crest (NC) is a multipotent population of migratory cells unique to
the vertebrate embryo, contributing to the development of multiple organ systems.
Transcription factors pax3 and zic1 are among the earliest genes activated in NC 
progenitors, and they are both necessary and sufficient to promote NC fate. In
order to further characterize the function of these transcription factors during 
NC development we have used hormone inducible fusion proteins in a Xenopus animal
cap assay, and DNA microarray to identify downstream targets of Pax3 and Zic1.
Here we present the results of this screen and the initial validation of these
targets using quantitative RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and morpholinos-mediated
knockdown. Among the targets identified we found several well-characterized
NC-specific genes, including snail2, foxd3, gbx2, twist, sox8 and sox9, which
validate our approach. We also obtained several factors with no known function in
Xenopus NC, which represent novel regulators of NC fate. The comprehensive
characterization of Pax3 and Zic1 targets function in the NC gene regulatory
network, are essential to understanding the mechanisms regulating the emergence
of this important cell population.

Neural crest development is orchestrated by a complex and still poorly understood
gene regulatory network. Premigratory neural crest is induced at the lateral
border of the neural plate by the combined action of signaling molecules and
transcription factors such as AP2, Gbx2, Pax3 and Zic1. Among them, Pax3 and Zic1
are both necessary and sufficient to trigger a complete neural crest
developmental program. However, their gene targets in the neural crest regulatory
network remain unknown. Here, through a transcriptome analysis of frog
microdissected neural border, we identified an extended gene signature for the
premigratory neural crest, and we defined novel potential members of the
regulatory network. This signature includes 34 novel genes, as well as 44 known
genes expressed at the neural border. Using another microarray analysis which
combined Pax3 and Zic1 gain-of-function and protein translation blockade, we
uncovered 25 Pax3 and Zic1 direct targets within this signature. We demonstrated 
that the neural border specifiers Pax3 and Zic1 are direct upstream regulators of
neural crest specifiers Snail1/2, Foxd3, Twist1, and Tfap2b. In addition, they
may modulate the transcriptional output of multiple signaling pathways involved
in neural crest development (Wnt, Retinoic Acid) through the induction of key
pathway regulators (Axin2 and Cyp26c1). We also found that Pax3 could maintain
its own expression through a positive autoregulatory feedback loop. These
hierarchical inductions, feedback loops, and pathway modulations provide novel
tools to understand the neural crest induction network.

Biphasic influence of Miz1 on neural crest development by regulating cell
survival and apical adhesion complex formation in the developing neural tube.

Kerosuo L(1), Bronner ME.

Author information:

Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125.

Myc interacting zinc finger protein-1 (Miz1) is a transcription factor known to
regulate cell cycle- and cell adhesion-related genes in cancer. Here we show that
Miz1 also plays a critical role in neural crest development. In the chick, Miz1
is expressed throughout the neural plate and closing neural tube. Its
morpholino-mediated knockdown affects neural crest precursor survival, leading to
reduction of neural plate border and neural crest specifier genes Msx-1, Pax7,
FoxD3, and Sox10. Of interest, Miz1 loss also causes marked reduction of adhesion
molecules (N-cadherin, cadherin6B, and a1-catenin) with a concomitant increase of
E-cadherin in the neural folds, likely leading to delayed and decreased neural
crest emigration. Conversely, Miz1 overexpression results in up-regulation of
cadherin6B and FoxD3 expression in the neural folds/neural tube, leading to
premature neural crest emigration and increased number of migratory crest cells. 
Although Miz1 loss effects cell survival and proliferation throughout the neural 
plate, the neural progenitor marker Sox2 was unaffected, suggesting a neural
crest-selective effect. The results suggest that Miz1 is important not only for
survival of neural crest precursors, but also for maintenance of integrity of the
neural folds and tube, via correct formation of the apical adhesion complex
therein.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although ES cells have been derived from very early
stage embryos in different species, but, so far ES cell line could be derived
from early stage IVF embryos in buffalo. The present experiment was carried out
to study the effects of different growth factors on attachment, formation of ES
cell colonies, their extent of passaging and relative expression of pluripotency 
marker in these colonies in buffalo.
METHODS AND RESULTS: For this, 8~16 cell stages zona free IVF embryos were
cultured with different culture condition viz. Control, Media-I: (Control+SCF),
Media-II: (Control+SCF+bFGF) and Media-III: (Control+SCF+bFGF+IGF1). A total of
25 number of embryos were cultured in each medium. The efficiency (%) of
blastomere attachment, % stem cell colony formation were recorded and number of
passaging were evaluated in each culture condition. The results indicated that
the efficiency of embryonic blastomere attachment, % stem cell colonies formation
and propagation were significantly higher when medium was supplemented with
growth factors viz. SCF, bFGF and IGF-1 (Media-III) than when supplemented with
either SCF or SCF+bFGF. The expression of pluripotent genes viz Oct4, Nanog,
FoxD3 and KLF4 were significantly higher (p<0.005) when medium was supplemented
with three growth factors.
CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that when 8~16 cell stages zona free IVF embryos
of buffalo was cultured on feeder,the %of blastomere attachment, % of ES cell
colony formation and their further propagation were higher in ES cell medium
supplemented with SCF+bFGF+IGF1 which may be due to high expression of
pluripotent stem cell markers.

The neural crest, an embryonic stem cell population, initially resides within the
dorsal neural tube but subsequently undergoes an epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) to commence migration. Although neural crest and cancer EMTs are
morphologically similar, little is known regarding conservation of their
underlying molecular mechanisms. We report that Sip1, which is involved in cancer
EMT, plays a critical role in promoting the neural crest cell transition to a
mesenchymal state. Sip1 transcripts are expressed in premigratory/migrating crest
cells. After Sip1 loss, the neural crest specifier gene FoxD3 was abnormally
retained in the dorsal neuroepithelium, whereas Sox10, which is normally required
for emigration, was diminished. Subsequently, clumps of adherent neural crest
cells remained adjacent to the neural tube and aberrantly expressed E-cadherin
while lacking N-cadherin. These findings demonstrate two distinct phases of
neural crest EMT, detachment and mesenchymalization, with the latter involving a 
novel requirement for Sip1 in regulation of cadherin expression during completion
of neural crest EMT.

Understanding gene regulatory networks controlling properties of pluripotent stem
cells will facilitate development of stem cell-based therapies. The transcription
factor Foxd3 is critical for maintenance of self-renewal, survival, and
pluripotency in murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Using a conditional deletion 
of Foxd3 followed by gene expression analyses, we demonstrate that genes required
for several developmental processes including embryonic organ development,
epithelium development, and epithelial differentiation were misregulated in the
absence of Foxd3. Additionally, we identified 6 novel targets of Foxd3 (Sox4,
Safb, Sox15, Fosb, Pmaip1 and Smarcd3). Finally, we present data suggesting that 
Foxd3 functions upstream of genes required for skeletal muscle development.
Together, this work provides further evidence that Foxd3 is a critical regulator 
of murine development through the regulation of lineage specific differentiation.

FOXD3 is a novel tumor suppressor that affects growth, invasion, metastasis and
angiogenesis of neuroblastoma.

The transcription factor forkhead box D3 (FOXD3) plays a crucial role in the
development of neural crest cells. However, the function and underlying
mechanisms of FOXD3 in the progression of neuroblastoma (NB), an embryonal tumor 
that is derived from the neural crest, still remain largely unknown. Here, we
report that FOXD3 is an important oncosuppressor of NB tumorigenicity and
aggressiveness. We found that FOXD3 was down-regulated in NB tissues and cell
lines. Patients with high FOXD3 expression have greater survival probability.
Over-expression or knockdown of FOXD3 responsively altered both the protein and
mRNA levels of N-myc downstream regulated 1 (NDRG1) and its downstream genes,
vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase 9, in cultured NB
cell lines SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH. Luciferase reporter and chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays indicated that FOXD3 directly targeted the binding
site within NDRG1 promoter to facilitate its transcription. Ectopic expression of
FOXD3 suppressed the growth, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis of SH-SY5Y and
SK-N-SH cells in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, knockdown of FOXD3 promoted the
growth, migration, invasion and angiogenesis of NB cells. In addition, rescue
experiments in FOXD3 over-expressed or silenced NB cells showed that restoration 
of NDRG1 expression prevented the tumor cells from FOXD3-mediated changes in
these biological features. Our results indicate that FOXD3 exhibits tumor
suppressive activity that affects the growth, aggressiveness and angiogenesis of 
NB through transcriptional regulation of NDRG1.

The neural crest is unique to vertebrates and has allowed the evolution of their 
complicated craniofacial structures. During vertebrate evolution, the acquisition
of the neural crest must have been accompanied by the emergence of a new gene
regulatory network (GRN). Here, to investigate the role of protein evolution in
the emergence of the neural crest GRN, we examined the neural crest cell (NCC)
differentiation-inducing activity of chordate FoxD genes. Amphioxus and
vertebrate (Xenopus) FoxD proteins both exhibited transcriptional repressor
activity in Gal4 transactivation assays and bound to similar DNA sequences in
vitro. However, whereas vertebrate FoxD3 genes induced the differentiation of
ectopic NCCs when overexpressed in chick neural tube, neither amphioxus FoxD nor 
any other vertebrate FoxD paralogs exhibited this activity. Experiments using
chimeric proteins showed that the N-terminal portion of the vertebrate FoxD3
protein is critical to its NCC differentiation-inducing activity. Furthermore,
replacement of the N-terminus of amphioxus FoxD with a 39-amino-acid segment from
zebrafish FoxD3 conferred neural crest-inducing activity on amphioxus FoxD or
zebrafish FoxD1. Therefore, fixation of this N-terminal amino acid sequence may
have been crucial in the evolutionary recruitment of FoxD3 to the vertebrate
neural crest GRN.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of resveratrol (RV) in reprogramming mouse 
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and the 
related mechanism.
METHODS: Primary MEFs were isolated from E13.5 embryos and used within three
passages. Retroviruses expressing Sox2 and Oct4 were produced by transfecting
GP2-293t cells with recombinant plasmids (MSCV)-Sox2 and MSCV-Oct4. Supernatants 
containing retroviruses were obtained after 48-hour transfection and MEFs were
then infected. Different concentrations (0, 5, 10 and 20 µmol/L) of RV were added
to embryonic stem cell (ESC) medium to culture MEFs 48 h post-infection. iPSC
clones emerged and were further cultured. Expression of pluripotent markers of
iPSCs was identified by cell immunofluorescence and reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Both cytotoxicity and cell proliferation
were assayed by Western blot analysis after RV was added into ESC medium. The
ultrastructure change of mitochondria was observed by electron microscopy.
RESULTS: More than 2.9-fold and 1.3-fold increases in colony number were observed
by treatment with RV at 5 and 10 µmol/L, respectively. The reprogramming
efficiency was significantly decreased by treatment with 20 µmol/L RV. The
proliferation effect on MEFs or MEFs infected by two factors Sox2/Oct4 (2
factors-MEFs, 2F-MEFs) was investigated after RV treatment. At 20 µmol/L RV,
induced cell apoptosis and proliferation inhibition were more obvious than those 
of 5 and 10 µmol/L treatments. Clones were selected from the 10 µmol/L RV-treated
group and cultured. Green fluorescent protein expression from one typical clone
was silenced one month later which expressed ESC-associated marker genes Gdf3,
Nanog, Ecat1, Fgf4 and Foxd3. Electron transmission microscope showed obvious
cavitations in mitochondria. The expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a was
up-regulated when 2F-MEFs were treated with RV compared to the control group.
CONCLUSION: RV improved the efficiency of reprogramming 2F-MEFs into iPSCs at low
and moderate concentrations (5 and 10 µmol/L). The effect of 10 µmol/L RV on
reprogramming was much greater than that of 5 µmol/L RV. However, high
concentration of RV (20 µmol/L) led to more severe cavitations in mitochondria
and caused cytotoxic effects. Taken together, these findings suggest that RV
mimics hypoxia in cells and promotes reprogramming at a low concentration.

Grb2 is regulated by foxd3 and has roles in preventing accumulation and
aggregation of mutant huntingtin.

Growth factor receptor protein binding protein 2 (Grb2) is known to be associated
with intracellular growth and proliferation related signaling cascades.
Huntingtin (Htt), a ubiquitously expressed protein, when mutated, forms toxic
intracellular aggregates - the hallmark of Huntington's disease (HD). We observed
an elevated expression of Grb2 in neuronal cells in animal and cell models of HD.
Grb2 overexpression was predominantly regulated by the transcription factor
Forkhead Box D3 (Foxd3). Exogenous expression of Grb2 also reduced aggregation of
mutant Htt in Neuro2A cells. Grb2 is also known to interact with Htt, depending
on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. Grb2- mutant Htt
interaction in the contrary, took place in vesicular structures, independent of
EGFR activation that eventually merged with autophagosomes and activated the
autophagy machinery helping in autophagosome and lysosome fusion. Grb2, with its 
emerging dual role, holds promise for a survival mechanism for HD.

The integration of multiple morphogenic signalling pathways and transcription
factor networks is essential to mediate neural crest (NC) cell induction,
delamination, survival, stem-cell properties, fate choice and differentiation.
Although the transcriptional control of NC development is well documented in
mammals, the role of post-transcriptional modifications, and in particular
ubiquitination, has not been explored. Here we report an essential role for the
ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 in cranial NC cell development. Our analysis of Nedd4(-/-)
embryos identified profound deficiency of cranial NC cells in the absence of
structural defects in the neural tube. Nedd4 is expressed in migrating cranial NC
cells and was found to positively regulate expression of the NC transcription
factors Sox9, Sox10 and FoxD3. We found that in the absence of these factors, a
subset of cranial NC cells undergo apoptosis. In accordance with a lack of
cranial NC cells, Nedd4(-/-) embryos have deficiency of the trigeminal ganglia,
NC derived bone and malformation of the craniofacial skeleton. Our analyses
therefore uncover an essential role for Nedd4 in a subset of cranial NC cells and
highlight E3 ubiquitin ligases as a likely point of convergence for multiple NC
signalling pathways and transcription factor networks.

Predicting distinct organization of transcription factor binding sites on the
promoter regions: a new genome-based approach to expand human embryonic stem cell
regulatory network.

Self-proliferation and differentiation into distinct cell types have been made
stem cell as a promising target for regenerative medicine. Several key genes can 
regulate self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (hESCs). They work
together and build a transcriptional hierarchy. Coexpression and coregulation of 
genes control by common regulatory elements on the promoter regions.
Consequently, distinct organization and combination of transcription factor
binding sites (TFBSs modules) on promoter regions, in view of order and distance,
lead to a common specific expression pattern within a set of genes. To gain
insights into transcriptional regulation of hESCs, we selected promoter regions
of eleven common expressed hESC genes including SOX2, LIN28, STAT3, NANOG, LEFTB,
TDGF1, POU5F1, FOXD3, TERF1, REX1 and GDF3 to predict activating regulatory
modules on promoters and discover key corresponding transcription factors. Then, 
promoter regions in human genome were explored for modules and 328 genes
containing the same modules were detected. Using microarray data, we verified
that 102 of 328 genes commonly upregulate in hESCs. Also, using output data of
DNA-protein interaction assays, we found that 42 of all predicted genes are
targets of SOX2, NANOG and POU5F1. Additionally, a protein interaction network of
hESC genes was constructed based on biological processes, and interestingly, 126 
downregulated genes along with upregulated ones identified by promoter analysis
were predicted in the network. Based on the results, we suggest that the
identified genes, coregulating with common hESC genes, represent a novel approach
for gene discovery based on whole genome promoter analysis irrespective of gene
expression. Altogether, promoter profiling can be used to expand hESC
transcriptional regulatory circuitry by analysis of shared functional sequences
between genes. This approach provides a clear image on underlying regulatory
mechanism of gene expression profile and offers a novel approach in designing
gene networks of stem cell.

Normal function of Myf5 during gastrulation is required for pharyngeal arch
cartilage development in zebrafish embryos.

Myf5, a myogenic regulatory factor, plays a key role in regulating muscle
differentiation. However, it is not known if Myf5 has a regulatory role during
early embryogenesis. Here, we used myf5-morpholino oligonucleotides [MO] to knock
down myf5 expression and demonstrated a series of results pointing to the
functional roles of Myf5 during early embryogenesis: (1) reduced head size
resulting from abnormal morphology in the cranial skeleton; (2) decreased
expressions of the cranial neural crest (CNC) markers foxd3, sox9a, dlx2, and
col2a1; (3) defect in the chondrogenic neural crest similar to that of fgf3
morphants; (4) reduced fgf3/fgf8 transcripts in the cephalic mesoderm rescued by 
co-injection of myf5 wobble-mismatched mRNA together with myf5-MO1 during 12 h
postfertilization; (5) abnormal patterns of axial and non-axial mesoderm causing 
expansion of the dorsal organizer, and (6) increased bmp4 gradient, but reduced
fgf3/fgf8 marginal gradient, during gastrulation. Interestingly, overexpression
of fgf3 could rescue the cranial cartilage defects caused by myf5-MO1, suggesting
that Myf5 modulates craniofacial cartilage development through the fgf3 signaling
pathway. Together, the loss of Myf5 function results in a cascade effect that
begins with abnormal formation of the dorsal organizer during gastrulation,
causing, in turn, defects in the CNC and cranial cartilage of myf5-knockdown
embryos.

Identification and dissection of a key enhancer mediating cranial neural crest
specific expression of transcription factor, Ets-1.

Neural crest cells form diverse derivatives that vary according to their level of
origin along the body axis, with only cranial neural crest cells contributing to 
facial skeleton. Interestingly, the transcription factor Ets-1 is uniquely
expressed in cranial but not trunk neural crest, where it functions as a direct
input into neural crest specifier genes, Sox10 and FoxD3. We have isolated and
interrogated a cis-regulatory element, conserved between birds and mammals, that 
drives reporter expression in a manner that recapitulates that of endogenous
Ets-1 expression in the neural crest. Within a minimal Ets-1 enhancer region,
mutation of putative binding sites for SoxE, homeobox, Ets, TFAP2 or Fox proteins
results in loss or reduction of neural crest enhancer activity.
Morpholino-mediated loss-of-function experiments show that Sox9, Pax7, Msx1/2,
Ets-1, TFAP2A and FoxD3, all are required for enhancer activity. In contrast,
mutation of a putative cMyc/E-box sequence augments reporter expression,
consistent with this being a repressor binding site. Taken together, these
results uncover new inputs into Ets-1, revealing critical links in the cranial
neural crest gene regulatory network.

Prdm1a directly activates foxd3 and tfap2a during zebrafish neural crest
specification.

The neural crest comprises multipotent precursor cells that are induced at the
neural plate border by a series of complex signaling and genetic interactions.
Several transcription factors, termed neural crest specifiers, are necessary for 
early neural crest development; however, the nature of their interactions and
regulation is not well understood. Here, we have established that the PR/SET
domain-containing transcription factor Prdm1a is co-expressed with two essential 
neural crest specifiers, foxd3 and tfap2a, at the neural plate border. Through
rescue experiments, chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assays, we have
determined that Prdm1a directly binds to and transcriptionally activates
enhancers for foxd3 and tfap2a and that they are functional, direct targets of
Prdm1a at the neural plate border. Additionally, analysis of dominant activator
and dominant repressor Prdm1a constructs suggests that Prdm1a is required both as
a transcriptional activator and transcriptional repressor for neural crest
development in zebrafish embryos.

Skin melanocytes arise from two sources: either directly from neural crest

colonization of peripheral nerves. The relationship between these two melanocyte 
populations and the factors controlling their specification remains poorly
understood. Direct lineage tracing reveals that neural crest and Schwann cell
progenitor-derived melanocytes are differentially restricted to the epaxial and
hypaxial body domains, respectively. Furthermore, although both populations are
initially part of the Foxd3 lineage, hypaxial melanocytes lose Foxd3 at late
stages upon separation from the nerve, whereas we recently found that epaxial
melanocytes segregate earlier from Foxd3-positive neural progenitors while still 
residing in the dorsal neural tube. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments in
avians and mice, respectively, reveal that Foxd3 is both sufficient and necessary
for regulating the balance between melanocyte and Schwann cell development. In
addition, Foxd3 is also sufficient to regulate the switch between neuronal and
glial fates in sensory ganglia. Together, we propose that differential fate
acquisition of neural crest-derived cells depends on their progressive
segregation from the Foxd3-positive lineage.

The engineered Fc-nonbinding (crystallizable fragment-nonbinding) CD3 antibody
has lower mitogenicity and a precise therapeutic window for disease remission in 
patients with type 1 diabetes. Before anti-CD3 can be considered for use in
transplantation, the most effective timing of treatment relative to
transplantation needs to be elucidated. In this study anti-CD3F(ab')2 fragments
or saline were administered intravenously for 5 consecutive days (early: d1-3 or 
delayed: d3-7) to mice transplanted with a cardiac allograft (H2(b)-to-H2(k);
d0). Survival of allografts was prolonged in mice treated with the early protocol
(MST = 48 days), but most were rejected by d100. In contrast, in mice treated
with the delayed protocol allografts continued to survive long term. The delayed 
protocol significantly inhibited donor alloreactivity at d30 as compared to the
early protocol. A marked increase in Foxp3(+) T cells (50.3 ± 1.6%) infiltrating 
the allografts in mice treated with the delayed protocol was observed (p < 0.0001
vs. early (24.9 ± 2.1%)) at d10; a finding that was maintained in the accepted
cardiac allografts at d100. We conclude that the timing of treatment with
anti-CD3 therapy is critical for inducing long-term graft survival. Delaying
administration effectively inhibits the alloreactivity and promotes the dominance
of intragraft Foxp3(+) T cells allowing long-term graft acceptance.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that play crucial roles
in numerous biological processes. However, the role of miRNAs in skin color
determination in fish has not been completely determined. Here, we identified
that 13 miRNAs are differentially expressed between red and white skin. The
analysis of miRNA spatial and temporal expression patterns suggests that miR-429 
is a potential regulator of skin pigmentation. miR-429 silencing results in an
obvious change in skin pigmentation. Bioinformatics analysis and a luciferase
reporter assay show that miR-429 directly regulates expression of Foxd3 by
targeting its 3'-untranslated (3'-UTR) region. miR-429 silencing leads to a
substantial increase in the expression of Foxd3 in vivo, thereby repressing the
transcription of MITF and its downstream genes, such as TYR, TYRP1 or TYRP2.
These findings would provide a novel insight into the determination of skin color
in fish.

Human embryonic stem cells (hESc) are known for its pluripotency and self renewal
capability, thus possess great potential in regenerative medicine. However, the
lack of suitable xenofree extracellular matrix substrate inhibits further
applications or the use of hESc in cell-based therapy. In this study, we
described a new differentiation method, which generates a homogeneous population 
of mesenchymal progenitor cells (hESc-MPC) from hESc via epithelial-mesenchymal
transition. The extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins from hESc-MPC had in turn
supported the undifferentiated expansion of hESc. Immunocytochemistry and flow
cytometry characterization of hESc-MPC revealed the presence of early mesenchymal
markers. Tandem mass spectometry analysis of ECM produced by hESc-MPC revealed
the presence of a mixture of extracellular proteins which includes tenascin C,
fibronectin, and vitronectin. The pluripotency of hESc (MEL-1) cultured on the
ECM was maintained as shown by the expression of pluripotent genes (FoxD3, Oct-4,
Tdgf1, Sox-2, Nanog, hTERT, Rex1), protein markers (SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-81,
TRA-1-60, Oct-4) and the ability to differentiate into cells representative of
ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. In summary, we have established a xeno-free
autogenic feeder free system to support undifferentiated expansion of hESc, which
could be of clinical relevance.

A dynamic code of dorsal neural tube genes regulates the segregation between
neurogenic and melanogenic neural crest cells.

Understanding when and how multipotent progenitors segregate into diverse fates
is a key question during embryonic development. The neural crest (NC) is an
exemplary model system with which to investigate the dynamics of progenitor cell 
specification, as it generates a multitude of derivatives. Based on 'in ovo'
lineage analysis, we previously suggested an early fate restriction of
premigratory trunk NC to generate neural versus melanogenic fates, yet the timing
of fate segregation and the underlying mechanisms remained unknown. Analysis of
progenitors expressing a Foxd3 reporter reveals that prospective melanoblasts
downregulate Foxd3 and have already segregated from neural lineages before
emigration. When this downregulation is prevented, late-emigrating avian
precursors fail to upregulate the melanogenic markers Mitf and MC/1 and the
guidance receptor Ednrb2, generating instead glial cells that express P0 and
Fabp. In this context, Foxd3 lies downstream of Snail2 and Sox9, constituting a
minimal network upstream of Mitf and Ednrb2 to link melanogenic specification
with migration. Consistent with the gain-of-function data in avians, loss of
Foxd3 function in mouse NC results in ectopic melanogenesis in the dorsal tube
and sensory ganglia. Altogether, Foxd3 is part of a dynamically expressed gene
network that is necessary and sufficient to regulate fate decisions in
premigratory NC. Their timely downregulation in the dorsal neural tube is thus
necessary for the switch between neural and melanocytic phases of NC development.

Genetic reprogramming of adult cells to generate induced pluripotent stem (iPS)
cells is a new and important step in sidestepping some of the ethical issues and 
risks involved in the use of embryonic stem cells. iPS cells can be generated by 
introduction of transcription factors, such as OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and CMYC. iPS
cells resemble embryonic stem cells in their properties and differentiation
potential. The mechanisms that lead to induced pluripotency and the effect of
each transcription factor are not completely understood. We performed a critical 
evaluation of the effect of overexpressing OCT4 in mesenchymal stem cells and
fibroblasts and found that OCT4 can activate the expression of other stemness
genes, such as SOX2, NANOG, CMYC, FOXD3, KLF4, and ßCATENIN, which are not
normally or are very weakly expressed in mesenchymal stem cells. Transient
expression of OCT4 was also performed to evaluate whether these genes are
affected by its overexpression in the first 48 h. Transfected fibroblast cells
expressed around 275-fold more OCT4 than non-transfected cells. In transient
expression, in which cells were analyzed after 48 h, we detected only the
up-regulation of FOXD3, SOX2, and KLF4 genes, suggesting that these genes are the
earlier targets of OCT4 in this cellular type. We conclude that forced expression
of OCT4 can alter cell status and activate the pluripotent network. Knowledge
gained through study of these systems may help us to understand the kinetics and 
mechanism of cell reprogramming.

TCF1 belongs to the family of LEF1/TCF transcription factors that regulate gene
expression downstream of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling, which is crucial for embryonic 
development and is involved in adult stem cell regulation and tumor growth. In
early Xenopus embryos, tcf1 plays an important role in mesoderm induction and
patterning. Foxd3 emerged as a potential tcf1 target gene in a microarray
analysis of gastrula stage embryos. Because foxd3 and tcf1 are coexpressed during
gastrulation, we investigated whether foxd3 is regulated by tcf1. By using
morpholino-mediated knockdown, we show that during gastrulation foxd3 expression 
is dependent on tcf1. By chromatin immunoprecipitation, we also demonstrate
direct interaction of ß-catenin/tcf complexes with the foxd3 gene locus. Hence,
our results indicate that tcf1 acts as an essential activator of foxd3, which is 
critical for dorsal mesoderm formation in early embryos.

The mechanisms underlying adaptive resistance of melanoma to targeted therapies
remain unclear. By combining ChIP sequencing with microarray-based gene
profiling, we determined that ERBB3 is upregulated by FOXD3, a transcription
factor that promotes resistance to RAF inhibitors in melanoma. Enhanced ERBB3
signaling promoted resistance to RAF pathway inhibitors in cultured melanoma cell
lines and in mouse xenograft models. ERBB3 signaling was dependent on ERBB2;
targeting ERBB2 with lapatinib in combination with the RAF inhibitor PLX4720
reduced tumor burden and extended latency of tumor regrowth in vivo versus
PLX4720 alone. These results suggest that enhanced ERBB3 signaling may serve as a
mechanism of adaptive resistance to RAF and MEK inhibitors in melanoma and that
cotargeting this pathway may enhance the clinical efficacy and extend the
therapeutic duration of RAF inhibitors.

Zebrafish transgenic lines are important experimental tools for lineage tracing
and imaging studies. It is crucial to precisely characterize the cell lineages
labeled in transgenic lines to understand their limitations and thus properly
interpret the data obtained from their use; only then can we confidently select a
line appropriate for our particular research objectives. Here we profiled the
cell lineages labeled in the closely related neural crest transgenic lines
Tg(foxd3:GFP), Tg(sox10:eGFP) and Tg(sox10:mRFP). These fish were crossed to
generate embryos, in which foxd3 and sox10 transgenic neural crest labeling could
be directly compared at the cellular level using live confocal imaging. We have
identified key differences in the cell lineages labeled in each line during early
neural crest development and demonstrated that the most anterior cranial neural
crest cells initially migrating out of neural tube at the level of forebrain and 
anterior midbrain express sox10:eGFP and sox10:mRFP, but not foxd3:GFP. This
differential profile was robustly maintained in the differentiating progeny of
the neural crest lineages until 3.5dpf. Our data will enable researchers to make 
an informed choice in selecting transgenic lines for future neural crest
research.

Tetraspanin18 is a FoxD3-responsive antagonist of cranial neural crest
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition that maintains cadherin-6B protein.

During epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), tightly associated, polarized 
epithelial cells become individual mesenchymal cells capable of migrating. Here, 
we investigate the role of the transmembrane protein tetraspanin18 (Tspan18) in
chick cranial neural crest EMT. Tspan18 mRNA is expressed in premigratory cranial
neural crest cells, but is absent from actively migrating neural crest cells.
Tspan18 knockdown leads to a concomitant loss of cadherin-6B (Cad6B) protein,
whereas Cad6B protein persists when Tspan18 expression is extended. The temporal 
profile of Cad6B mRNA downregulation is unaffected in these embryos, which
indicates that Tspan18 maintains Cad6B protein levels and reveals that Cad6B is
regulated by post-translational mechanisms. Although downregulation of Tspan18 is
necessary, it is not sufficient for neural crest migration: the timing of neural 
crest emigration, basal lamina breakdown and Cad7 upregulation proceed normally
in Tspan18-deficient cells. This emphasizes the need for coordinated
transcriptional and post-translational regulation of Cad6B during EMT and
illustrates that Tspan18-antagonized remodeling of cell-cell adhesions is only
one step in preparation for cranial neural crest migration. Unlike Cad6B, which
is transcriptionally repressed by Snail2, Tspan18 expression is downstream of the
winged-helix transcription factor FoxD3, providing a new transcriptional input
into cranial neural crest EMT. Together, our data reveal post-translational
regulation of Cad6B protein levels by Tspan18 that must be relieved by a
FoxD3-dependent mechanism in order for cranial neural crest cells to migrate.
These results offer new insight into the molecular mechanisms of cranial neural
crest EMT and expand our understanding of tetraspanin function relevant to
metastasis.

Stem cells (SC) are able to self-renew and to differentiate into many types of
committed cells, making SCs interesting for cellular therapy. However, the pool
of SCs in vivo and in vitro consists of a mix of cells at several stages of
differentiation, making it difficult to obtain a homogeneous population of SCs
for research. Therefore, it is important to isolate and characterize unambiguous 
molecular markers that can be applied to SCs. Here, we review classical and new
candidate molecular markers that have been established to show a molecular
profile for human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),
and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The commonly cited markers for embryonic
ESCs are Nanog, Oct-4, Sox-2, Rex-1, Dnmt3b, Lin-28, Tdgf1, FoxD3, Tert, Utf-1,
Gal, Cx43, Gdf3, Gtcm1, Terf1, Terf2, Lefty A, and Lefty B. MSCs are primarily
identified by the expression of CD13, CD29, CD44, CD49e, CD54, CD71, CD73, CD90, 
CD105, CD106, CD166, and HLA-ABC and lack CD14, CD31, CD34, CD45, CD62E, CD62L,
CD62P, and HLA-DR expression. HSCs are mainly isolated based on the expression of
CD34, but the combination of this marker with CD133 and CD90, together with a
lack of CD38 and other lineage markers, provides the most homogeneous pool of
SCs. Here, we present new and alternative markers for SCs, along with microRNA
profiles, for these cells.

BRAF mutation-specific promoter methylation of FOX genes in colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND: Cancer-specific hypermethylation of (promoter) CpG islands is common 
during the tumorigenesis of colon cancer. Although associations between certain
genetic aberrations, such as BRAF mutation and microsatellite instability, and
the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), have been found, the mechanisms by
which these associations are established are still unclear. We studied
genome-wide DNA methylation differences between colorectal tumors carrying a BRAF
mutation and BRAF wildtype tumors.
RESULTS: Using differential methylation hybridization on oligonucleotide
microarrays representing 32,171 CpG-rich regions, we identified 1,770 regions
with differential methylation between colorectal tumor and paired normal colon.
Next, we compared the tumor/normal methylation ratios between different groups of
patients. Related to CIMP, we identified 749 differentially methylated regions,
of which 86% had a higher tumor/normal methylation ratio in the CIMP-positive
group. We identified 758 regions with a BRAF mutation-specific methylation
change, of which 96% had a higher tumor/normal methylation ratio in the BRAF
mutant group. Among the genes affected by BRAF mutation-specific methylation
changes, we found enrichment of several cancer-related pathways, including the
PI3 kinase and Wnt signaling pathways. To focus on genes that are silenced in a
tumor-specific rather than a lineage-specific manner, we used information on the 
epigenetic silencing mark H3K27me3 in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Among the genes 
showing BRAF mutation-specific promoter methylation but no H3K27me3 mark in ES
cells were forkhead box (FOX) transcription factors associated with the PI3
kinase pathway, as well as MLH1 and SMO. Repression of FOXD3 gene expression in
tumors could be related to its promoter hypermethylation.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified new BRAF mutation-specific methylation changes in
colorectal cancer. Epigenetic downregulation of these targets may contribute to
mutationally active BRAF-driven tumorigenesis, explaining its association with
aberrant DNA methylation.

Skin-derived precursors (SKPs) are an attractive stem cell model for cell-based
therapies. SKPs can be readily generated from embryonic and adult mice and adult 
humans, exhibit a high degree of multipotency, and have the potential to serve as
a patient autologous stem cell. The advancement of these cells toward therapeutic
use depends on the ability to control precisely the self-renewal and
differentiation of SKPs. Here we show that two well-known stem cell factors,
Foxd3 and Sox2, are critical regulators of the stem cell properties of SKPs.
Deletion of Foxd3 completely abolishes the sphere-forming potential of these
cells. In the absence of Sox2, SKP spheres can be formed, but with reduced size
and frequency. Our results provide entry points into the gene regulatory networks
dictating SKP behavior, and pave the way for future studies on a therapeutically 
relevant stem cell.

Dynamic and differential regulation of stem cell factor FoxD3 in the neural crest
is Encrypted in the genome.

The critical stem cell transcription factor FoxD3 is expressed by the
premigratory and migrating neural crest, an embryonic stem cell population that
forms diverse derivatives. Despite its important role in development and stem
cell biology, little is known about what mediates FoxD3 activity in these cells. 
We have uncovered two FoxD3 enhancers, NC1 and NC2, that drive reporter
expression in spatially and temporally distinct manners. Whereas NC1 activity
recapitulates initial FoxD3 expression in the cranial neural crest, NC2 activity 
recapitulates initial FoxD3 expression at vagal/trunk levels while appearing only
later in migrating cranial crest. Detailed mutational analysis, in vivo chromatin
immunoprecipitation, and morpholino knock-downs reveal that transcription factors
Pax7 and Msx1/2 cooperate with the neural crest specifier gene, Ets1, to bind to 
the cranial NC1 regulatory element. However, at vagal/trunk levels, they function
together with the neural plate border gene, Zic1, which directly binds to the NC2
enhancer. These results reveal dynamic and differential regulation of FoxD3 in
distinct neural crest subpopulations, suggesting that heterogeneity is encrypted 
at the regulatory level. Isolation of neural crest enhancers not only allows
establishment of direct regulatory connections underlying neural crest formation,
but also provides valuable tools for tissue specific manipulation and
investigation of neural crest cell identity in amniotes.

Elk3 is essential for the progression from progenitor to definitive neural crest 
cell.

(1)Division of Biology 139-74, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA
91125, USA.

Elk3/Net/Sap2 (here referred to as Elk3) is an Ets ternary complex
transcriptional repressor known for its involvement in angiogenesis during
embryonic development. Although Elk3 is expressed in various tissues, additional 
roles for the protein outside of vasculature development have yet to be reported.
Here, we characterize the early spatiotemporal expression pattern of Elk3 in the 
avian embryo using whole mount in situ hybridization and quantitative RT-PCR and 
examine the effects of its loss of function on neural crest development. At early
stages, Elk3 is expressed in the head folds, head mesenchyme, intersomitic
vessels, and migratory cranial neural crest (NC) cells. Loss of the Elk3 protein 
results in the retention of Pax7+ precursors in the dorsal neural tube that fail 
to upregulate neural crest specifier genes, FoxD3, Sox10 and Snail2, resulting in
embryos with severe migration defects. The results putatively place Elk3
downstream of neural plate border genes, but upstream of neural crest specifier
genes in the neural crest gene regulatory network (NC-GRN), suggesting that it is
critical for the progression from progenitor to definitive neural crest cell.

Abstract  ß-Cell mass increases during pregnancy in adaptation to the insulin
resistance of pregnancy. This increase is accompanied by an increase in ß-cell
proliferation, a process that requires intact prolactin receptor (Prlr)
signalling. Previously, it was found that during pregnancy, heterozygous
prolactin receptor-null (Prlr(+/-)) mice had lower number of ß-cells, lower serum
insulin and higher blood glucose levels than wild-type (Prlr(+/+)) mice. An
unexpected observation was that the glucose homeostasis of the experimental mouse
depends on the genotype of her mother, such that within the Prlr(+/+) group, the 
Prlr(+/+) offspring derived from Prlr(+/+) mothers (Prlr(+/+(+/+))) had higher
ß-cell mass and lower blood glucose than those derived from Prlr(+/-) mothers
(Prlr(+/+(+/-))). Pathways that are known to regulate ß-cell proliferation during
pregnancy include insulin receptor substrate-2, Akt, menin, the serotonin
synthetic enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase-1, Forkhead box M1 and Forkhead box D3.
The aim of the present study was to determine whether dysregulation in these
signalling molecules in the islets could explain the maternal effect on the
phenotype of the offspring. It was found that the pregnancy-induced increases in 
insulin receptor substrate-2 and Akt expression in the islets were attenuated in 
the Prlr(+/+(+/-)) mice in comparison to the Prlr(+/+(+/+)) mice. The expression 
of Forkhead box D3, which plays a permissive role for ß-cell proliferation during
pregnancy, was also lower in the Prlr(+/+(+/-)) mice. In contrast, the
pregnancy-induced increases in phospho-Jak2, tryptophan hydroxylase-1 and FoxM1, 
as well as the pregnancy-associated reduction in menin expression, were
comparable between the two groups. There was also no difference in expression
levels of genes that regulate insulin synthesis and secretion (i.e. glucose
transporter 2, glucokinase and pancreatic and duodenal homeobox-1) between these 
two groups. Taken together, these results suggest that the in utero environment
of the Prlr(+/-) mother confers long-term changes in the pancreatic islets of her
offspring such that when the offspring themselves became pregnant, they cannot
adapt to the increased insulin demands of their own pregnancy.

Neural crest cells migrate extensively and contribute to diverse derivatives,
including the craniofacial skeleton, peripheral neurons and glia, and pigment
cells. Although several transgenic lines label neural crest subpopulations, few
are suited for studying early events in neural crest development. Here, we
present a zebrafish gene/protein trap line gt(foxd3-citrine)(ct110a) that
expresses a Citrine fusion protein with FoxD3, a transcription factor expressed
in premigratory and migrating neural crest cells. In this novel line, citrine
expression exactly parallels endogenous foxd3 expression. High-resolution
time-lapse imaging reveals the dynamic phases of precursor and migratory neural
crest cell movements from the neural keel stage to times of active cell
migration. In addition, Cre-recombination produces a variant line
FoxD3-mCherry-pA whose homozygosis generates a FoxD3 mutant. Taking advantage of 
the endogenously regulated expression of FoxD3-mCherry fusion protein, we
directly assess early effects of FoxD3 loss-of-function on specification and
morphogenesis of dorsal root ganglia, craniofacial skeleton and melanophores.
These novel lines provide new insights and useful new tools for studying
specification, migration and differentiation of neural crest cells.

Human fetal mesenchymal stem cells can be isolated from the amniotic membrane
(AM-hMSCs) by enzymatic digestion. The biological properties of this cell
population have been characterized; however, few studies have focused on the
presence of stem cell subpopulations and their differentiation potential. The aim
of the present study was to isolate homogeneous AM-hMSC subpopulations based on
the coexpression of surface markers. In addition, we aimed to characterize stem
cell subpopulations through the detection of typical stem cell markers and its
differentiation potential. In this study, fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) was used to positively select for the surface markers CD44, CD73, and
CD105. Two subpopulations were isolated: CD44+ / CD73+ / CD105+ (CD105+), and
CD44+ / CD73+ / CD105- (CD105-). To characterize the cell subpopulations, the
expression of pluripotency-associated markers was analyzed by reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence. Our results
showed positive expression of SOX2, SOX3, PAX6, OCT3/4, and NANOG in the CD105+
and CD105(-) cell subpopulations. In contrast, we did not detect expression of
SSEA4 or FOXD3 in either subpopulation. Immunophenotypes, such as mesenchymal and
hematopoietic markers, were studied by FACS analyses. Our data revealed the
expression of the CD49a, CD49d, CD29, integrin a9ß1, CD44, CD73, and CD105
antigens in both subpopulations. In contrast, CD90, CD45, CD34, CD14, and HLA-DR 
expression was not detected. The ability of both subpopulations to differentiate 
into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes was evidenced using Alizarin red, 
Oil-Red, and Alcian blue staining, respectively. Furthermore, neuronal
differentiation was demonstrated by the expression of GFAP and NEURO-D.
Interestingly, we observed a dissimilar osteoblastic differentiation potential
between the subpopulations. CD105- cells showed stronger expression of secreted
protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) and osteonectin, which was associated
with more effective calcium deposition, than CD105+ cells. In conclusion, we
described a systematic method for the isolation of hMSCs that was highly
reproducible and generated homogeneous cultures for osteoblast differentiation
with an efficient capacity for mineralization.

In this study, we describe the production of buffalo parthenogenetic blastocysts 
and subsequent isolation of parthenogenetic embryonic stem cell (PGESC)-like
cells. PGESC colonies exhibited dome-shaped morphology and were clearly
distinguishable from the feeder layer cells. Different stages of development of
parthenogenetic embryos and derived embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like cells
expressed key ESC-specific markers, including OCT-4, NANOG, SOX-2, FOXD3, REX-1, 
STAT-3, TELOMERASE, NUCLEOSTEMIN, and cMYC. Immunofluorescence-based studies
revealed that the PGESCs were positive for surface-based pluripotent markers,
viz., SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA 1-80, TRA 1-60, CD-9, and CD-90 and exhibited high
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. PGEC cell-like cells formed embryoid body
(EB)-like structures in hanging drop cultures and when cultured for extended
period of time spontaneously differentiated into derivatives of three embryonic
germ layers as confirmed by RT-PCR for ectodermal (CYTOKERATIN8, NF-68),
mesodermal (MSX1, BMP-4, ASA), and endodermal markers (AFP, HNF-4, GATA-4).
Differentiation of PGESCs toward the neuronal lineage was successfully directed
by supplementation of serum-containing media with retinoic acid. Our results
indicate that the isolated ESC-like cells from parthenogenetic blastocyst hold
properties of ESCs and express markers of pluripotency. The pluripotency markers 
were also expressed by early cleavage-stage of buffalo embryos.

Defective neural crest migration revealed by a Zebrafish model of Alx1-related
frontonasal dysplasia.

Frontonasal dysplasia (FND) refers to a class of midline facial malformations
caused by abnormal development of the facial primordia. The term encompasses a
spectrum of severities but characteristic features include combinations of ocular
hypertelorism, malformations of the nose and forehead and clefting of the facial 
midline. Several recent studies have drawn attention to the importance of Alx
homeobox transcription factors during craniofacial development. Most notably,
loss of Alx1 has devastating consequences resulting in severe orofacial clefting 
and extreme microphthalmia. In contrast, mutations of Alx3 or Alx4 cause milder
forms of FND. Whilst Alx1, Alx3 and Alx4 are all known to be expressed in the
facial mesenchyme of vertebrate embryos, little is known about the function of
these proteins during development. Here, we report the establishment of a
zebrafish model of Alx-related FND. Morpholino knock-down of zebrafish alx1
expression causes a profound craniofacial phenotype including loss of the facial 
cartilages and defective ocular development. We demonstrate for the first time
that Alx1 plays a crucial role in regulating the migration of cranial neural
crest (CNC) cells into the frontonasal primordia. Abnormal neural crest migration
is coincident with aberrant expression of foxd3 and sox10, two genes previously
suggested to play key roles during neural crest development, including migration,
differentiation and the maintenance of progenitor cells. This novel function is
specific to Alx1, and likely explains the marked clinical severity of Alx1
mutation within the spectrum of Alx-related FND.

    Gastroenterology. 2013 Jan;144(1):22-5.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Deregulation of forkhead box (Fox) proteins, an evolutionarily
conserved family of transcriptional regulators, leads to tumorigenesis. Little is
known about their regulation or functions in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. 
Promoter hypermethylation occurs during Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis. We
investigated whether the deregulated genes contribute to gastric tumorigenesis.
METHODS: We used integrative genome-wide scans to identify concomitant
hypermethylated genes in mice infected with H pylori and human gastric cancer
samples. We also analyzed epigenetic gene silencing in gastric tissues from
patients with H pylori infection and gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, gastric
tumors, or without disease (controls). Target genes were identified by chromatin 
immunoprecipitation microarrays and expression and luciferase reporter analyses.
RESULTS: Methylation profile analyses identified the promoter of FOXD3 as the
only genomic region with increased methylation in mice and humans during
progression of H pylori-associated gastric tumors. FOXD3 methylation also
correlated with shorter survival times of patients with gastric cancer. Genome
demethylation reactivated FOXD3 expression in gastric cancer cell lines.
Transgenic overexpression of FOXD3 significantly inhibited gastric cancer cell
proliferation and invasion, and reduced growth of xenograft tumors in mice, at
least partially, by promoting tumor cell apoptosis. FOXD3 bound directly to the
promoters of, and activated transcription of, genes encoding the cell death
regulators CYFIP2 and RARB. Levels of FOXD3, CYFIP2, and RARB messenger RNAs were
reduced in human gastric tumor samples, compared with control tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: FOXD3-mediated transcriptional control of tumor suppressors is
deregulated by H pylori infection-induced hypermethylation; this could perturb
the balance between cell death and survival. These findings identify a pathway by
which epigenetic changes affect gastric tumor suppression.

FGF signaling transforms non-neural ectoderm into neural crest.

University, P.O. Box 208103, New Haven, CT 06520-8103, USA.

The neural crest arises at the border between the neural plate and the adjacent
non-neural ectoderm. It has been suggested that both neural and non-neural
ectoderm can contribute to the neural crest. Several studies have examined the
molecular mechanisms that regulate neural crest induction in neuralized tissues
or the neural plate border. Here, using the chick as a model system, we address
the molecular mechanisms by which non-neural ectoderm generates neural crest. We 
report that in response to FGF the non-neural ectoderm can ectopically express
several early neural crest markers (Pax7, Msx1, Dlx5, Sox9, FoxD3, Snail2, and
Sox10). Importantly this response to FGF signaling can occur without inducing
ectopic mesodermal tissues. Furthermore, the non-neural ectoderm responds to FGF 
by expressing the prospective neural marker Sox3, but it does not express
definitive markers of neural or anterior neural (Sox2 and Otx2) tissues. These
results suggest that the non-neural ectoderm can launch the neural crest program 
in the absence of mesoderm, without acquiring definitive neural character.
Finally, we report that prior to the upregulation of these neural crest markers, 
the non-neural ectoderm upregulates both BMP and Wnt molecules in response to
FGF. Our results provide the first effort to understand the molecular events
leading to neural crest development via the non-neural ectoderm in amniotes and
present a distinct response to FGF signaling.

Cardiotoxicity is one of the leading causes of drug attrition. Current in vitro
models insufficiently predict cardiotoxicity, and there is a need for alternative
physiologically relevant models. Here we describe the gene expression profile of 
human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiocytes (iCC) postthaw over a
period of 42 days in culture and compare this profile to human fetal and adult as
well as adult cynomolgus nonhuman primate (NHP, Macaca fascicularis) heart
tissue. Our results indicate that iCC express relevant cardiac markers such as
ion channels (SCN5A, KCNJ2, CACNA1C, KCNQ1, and KCNH2), tissue-specific
structural markers (MYH6, MYLPF, MYBPC3, DES, TNNT2, and TNNI3), and
transcription factors (NKX2.5, GATA4, and GATA6) and lack the expression of stem 
cell markers (FOXD3, GBX2, NANOG, POU5F1, SOX2, and ZFP42). Furthermore, we
performed a functional evaluation of contractility of the iCC and showed
functional and pharmacological correlations with myocytes isolated from adult NHP
hearts. These results suggest that stem cell-derived cardiocytes may represent a 
novel in vitro model to study human cardiac toxicity with potential ex vivo and
in vivo translation.

Origin and plasticity of the subdivisions of the inferior olivary complex.

Author information: 
(1)Institut Cochin, Université Paris Descartes, CNRS (UMR 8104), Paris, France.

The precerebellar nuclei (PCN) originate from the rhombic lip, a germinal
neuroepithelium adjacent to the roof plate of the fourth ventricle. We first
report here that, in chicken, the Brn3a-expressing postmitotic medullary cells
that produce the inferior olive (ION, the source of cerebellar climbing fibres)
originate from a dorso-ventral domain roughly coinciding with the hindbrain
vestibular column. Whereas Foxd3 expression labels the whole mature ION but is
only detected in a subpopulation of ION neuroblasts initiating their migration,
we report that Brn3a allows the visualization of the whole population of ION
neurons from the very beginning of their migration. We show that Brn3a-positive
neurons migrate tangentially ventralwards through a characteristic dorso-ventral 
double submarginal stream. Cath1 expressing progenitors lying just dorsal to the 
ION origin correlated dorso-ventral topography with the prospective cochlear
column (caudal to it) and generate precerebellar nuclei emitting mossy-fiber
cerebellar afferents. We used the chick-quail chimaera technique with homotopic
grafts at HH10 to determine the precise fate map of ION precursors across the
caudal cryptorhombomeric subdivisions of the medullary hindbrain (r8-r11). We
demonstrate that each crypto-rhombomere contributes to two lamellae of the ION,
while each ION sub-nucleus originates from at least two contiguous
crypto-rhombomeres. We then questioned how rhombomere identity is related to the 
plasticity of cell type specification in the dorsal hindbrain. The potential
plasticity of ectopically HH10 grafted ION progenitors to change their original
fate in alternative rostrocaudal environments was examined. Heterotopic grafts
from the presumptive ION territory to the pontine region (r4-r5) caused a change 
of fate, since the migrated derivatives adopted a pontine phenotype. The reverse 
experiment caused pontine progenitors to produce derivatives appropriately
integrated into the ION complex. Grafts of ION progenitor domains to myelomeres
(my) 2-3 also showed complete fate regulation, reproducing spinal cord-like
structures, whereas the reverse experiment revealed the inability of my2-3 to
generate ION cell types. This was not the case with more caudal, relatively less 
specified myelomeres (my5-6). Interestingly, when heterotopically grafted cells
are integrated dorsally, they do not change their phenotype. Our results support 
the hypothesis that positional information present in the hindbrain and spinal
cord at early neural tube stages controls the specific fates of ventrally
migrating PCN precursors.

Paladin is an antiphosphatase that regulates neural crest cell formation and
migration.

Although a network of transcription factors that specifies neural crest identity 
in the ectoderm has been defined, expression of neural crest transcription
factors does not guarantee eventual migration as a neural crest cell. While much 
work has gone into determining regulatory relationships within the transcription 
factor network, the ability of protein modifications like phosphorylation to
modulate the function of neural crest regulatory factors and determine when and
where they are active also has crucial implications. Paladin, which was
previously classified as a phosphatase based on sequence similarity, is expressed
in chick neural crest precursors and is maintained throughout their epithelial to
mesenchymal transition and migration. Loss of Paladin delays the expression of
transcription factors Snail2 and Sox10 in premigratory neural crest cells, but
does not affect accumulation of FoxD3, Cad6B or RhoB, indicating that Paladin
differentially modulates the expression of genes previously thought to be
coregulated within the neural crest gene regulatory network. Both gain and loss
of Paladin function result in disrupted neural crest migration, reinforcing the
importance of precisely regulated phosphorylation for neural crest migration.
Mutation of critical, catalytic cysteine residues within Paladin's predicted
phosphatase active site motifs did not abolish the function of Paladin in the
neural crest. Collectively, these data indicate that Paladin is an
antiphosphatase that modulates the activity of specific neural crest regulatory
factors during neural crest development. Our work identifies a novel regulator of
phosphorylation status that provides an additional layer of regulation in the
neural crest.

Modulation of FOXD3 activity in human embryonic stem cells directs pluripotency
and paraxial mesoderm fates.

Arduini BL(1), Brivanlou AH.

York, New York 10065, USA. arduib@rpi.edu

Transcription factor Foxd3 has been described in model systems as a key member of
the pluripotency network in mice as well as being involved in the formation of
many critical vertebrate cell types in vivo. Yet virtually nothing is known about
roles of FOXD3 in human development and conflicting reports exist regarding its
expression in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We find that FOXD3 is expressed
at both the RNA and protein levels in undifferentiated hESCs and report a Foxd3
expression domain in paraxial mesoderm derivatives of wild-type mouse embryos.
Furthermore, increasing FOXD3 activity in hESCs is sufficient for rapid and
specific generation of mesenchymal cell types of the paraxial mesoderm, even
under pluripotency maintenance conditions. Gene expression diagnostic of
chondroblasts, skeletal myoblasts, osteoblasts, and adipoblast is observed within
48 hours of FOXD3 induction, as are morphological and genetic hallmarks of
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. FOXD3-overexpressing cells can be
maintained for several passages, while downregulation of the transgene leads to
further differentiation. Loss-of-function also leads to differentiation, toward
endoderm and mesoderm. Taken together, these data indicate that a balance of
FOXD3 activity is required to maintain pluripotency.

Wisconsin and Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.

PURPOSE: The migratory neural crest cell population makes a significant
contribution to the anterior segment structures of the eye. Consequently, several
anterior segment dysgenesis phenotypes are associated with mutations in genes
expressed during neural crest development. The forkhead box D3 (FOXD3) gene
encodes a forkhead transcription factor that plays an important role in neural
crest specification in vertebrates and therefore may be involved in human eye
disease.
METHODS: We screened 310 probands with developmental ocular conditions for
variations in FOXD3.
RESULTS: Six nonsynonymous FOXD3 variants were identified. Four of these changes,
c.47C>T (p.Thr16Met), c.359C>T (p.Pro120Leu), c.517A>C (p.Asn173His), and
c.818_829dup (p.Arg273_Gly276dup), affected conserved regions and were observed
primarily in probands with aniridia or Peters anomaly; out of these four
variants, one, p.Arg273_Gly276dup, was not detected in control populations and
two, p.Pro120Leu and p.Asn173His, were statistically enriched in cases with
aniridia or Peters anomaly. The p.Arg273_Gly276dup variant was seen in a proband 
with aniridia as well as two additional unrelated probands affected with
anophthalmia or congenital cataracts. The p.Asn173His variant affects Helix 2 of 
the DNA-binding domain and was observed in two unrelated patients with Peters
anomaly or aniridia; in both cases, one parent carried the same allele.
CONCLUSIONS: FOXD3 variants increase the risk of anterior segment dysgenesis
phenotypes in humans. The p.Asn173His mutation affects a residue in the forkhead 
domain that is 100% conserved among vertebrate orthologs and is predicted to
participate in protein-protein interactions. Its phenotypic effects may be
modulated by transcriptional cofactors which have yet to be identified.

When buffalo embryonic stem (ES) cell-like cells that expressed surface markers
SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, CD9 and CD90 and intracellular markers OCT4, SOX2 and
FOXD3, as shown by immunofluorescence, and that expressed REX-1 and NUCLEOSTEMIN 
as confirmed by RT-PCR, were subjected to suspension culture in hanging drops in 
absence of LIF and buffalo foetal fibroblast feeder layer support, they
differentiated to form three-dimensional embryoid bodies (EBs). Of 231 EBs
examined on Day 3 of suspension culture, 141 (61.3 ± 3.09%) were of compact type,
whereas 90 (38.4 ± 3.12%) were of cystic type. The cells obtained from EBs were
found to express NF-68 and NESTIN (ectodermal lineage), BMP-4 and a-skeletal
actin (mesodermal lineage), and a-fetoprotein, GATA-4 and HNF-4 (endodermal
lineage). When these EBs were cultured on gelatin-coated dishes, they
spontaneously differentiated to several cell types such as epithelial- and
neuron-like cells. When EBs were cultured in the presence of 1 or 2% DMSO or
10(-8) M or 10(-7) M retinoic acid for 25 days, ES cells could be directed to
form muscle cell-like cells, the identity of which was confirmed by expression of
a-actinin by immunofluorescence and of MYF-5, MYOD and MYOGENIN genes by RT-PCR. 
MYOD was first detected on Day 10 in both treatment groups and on Day 15 in
controls, whereas MYOGENIN was first detected on Day 10, Day 15 and Day 25 in the
presence of retinoic acid, in the presence of DMSO and in controls, respectively.
The present study demonstrates the ability of buffalo ES cell-like cells to
undergo directed differentiation to cells of skeletal myogenic lineage.

Human endothelial cells (ECs) have the ability to make up the lining of blood
vessels. These cells are also capable of neovascularization and revascularization
and have been applied in various clinical situations. With the aim of
understanding the effect of NANOG superexpression on ECs, we transduced the Nanog
gene into the ECs. Nanog is highly expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and
is essential for pluripotency and self-renewal. However, Nanog can also be
expressed in somatic stem cells, and this gene is related to great expansion
capacity in vitro. We found that ECs expressing Nanog showed expression of other 
stemness genes, such as Sox2, FoxD3, Oct4, Klf4, c-myc, and ß-catenin, that are
not normally expressed or are expressed at very low levels in ECs. Nanog is one
of the stemness genes that can activate other stemness genes, and the
upregulation of the Nanog gene seems to be critical for reprogramming cells. In
this study, the introduction of Nanog was sufficient to alter the expression of
key genes of the pluripotent pathway. The functional importance of Nanog for
altering the cell expression profile and morphology was clearly demonstrated by
our results.

laevis.

Aromatase, encoded by the cyp19a1 gene, is the key enzyme for estrogen
biosynthesis. Exon I.f of aromatase transcripts in the Xenopus brain is driven in
a brain-specific manner. In this study, we cloned brain aromatase with a 5'-end
of various lengths by 5'-RACE and detected the expression pattern of the
aromatase mRNA. In Xenopus at the larval stage, the brain aromatase mRNA
expression was five-fold higher than those in the gonad and liver, and was
upregulated from stage 42 to stage 50. After isolating the brain-specific
promoter I.f, which was located ~6.5 kb upstream from gonad-specific exon PII, we
observed this promoter in a potential cis-elements for several transcriptional
factors, such as Oct-1, c-Myc, the GATA gene family, C/EBPalpha, Sox5, p300,
XFD-1, AP1, the STAT gene family, FOXD3, and the Smad gene family. In addition,
the core promoter elements of two initiators and an atypical TATA box were found 
around the 5'-RACE products. In the 5'-flanking region of exon I.f, the binding
sites for nuclear extracts suggested that the followings are important: the STAT 
gene family, a 38-bp conserved region among five species, FOXD3, and the Smad
gene family within the region 200 bp upstream from the transcription initiation
site. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that the foxd3, smad2 and smad4.1/4.2
mRNAs are specifically expressed in the brain. Furthermore, the expression change
of foxd3, which has been reported as a repressor, indicated that expression
decreased to stage 50 from stage 42, contrary to that of aromatase mRNA. These
results may imply that foxd3 expression decreases and aromatase expression
increases as a result of the contribution to promoter I.f by transcriptional
activators such as smads. However, since these putative cis-elements and
transcription initiation sites are not conserved in the brain-specific promoter
of other species, this transcriptional regulatory mechanism of exon I.f may be
characteristic of Xenopus.

This study was aimed at establishing buffalo embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from in 
vitro fertilized (IVF), parthenogenetic, and hand-made cloned (HMC) embryos and
to check their equivalency in terms of stem cell marker expression, longevity,
proliferation, and differentiation pattern. ESCs derived from all three sources
were found by immunofluorescence to express the pluripotency markers SSEA-4,
TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, OCT4, and SOX2 and were able to form embryoid bodies
containing cells expressing genes specific to endoderm (AFP, HNF4, and GATA4),
mesoderm (MSX1, BMP4, and ASA), and ectoderm (cytokeratin 8 and NF68). Reverse
transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) showed cells from all sources to be positive for
pluripotency markers OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, STAT3, REX1, FOXD3, NUCLEOSTEMIN, and
TELOMERASE. Pluripotency markers OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and c-MYC were also analyzed 
by real-time PCR. No significant differences were observed among ESCs from all
three sources for all these genes except NANOG, whose expression was higher
(p<0.05) in HMC-derived ESCs (6.897±2.3) compared to that in parthenogenesis- and
IVF-derived cells (1.603±0.315 and 1±0, respectively). Pluripotent, stable
buffalo ESC lines derived from IVF, parthenogenesis, and HMC embryos may be
genetically manipulated to provide a powerful tool for studies involving
embryonic development, genomic imprinting, gene targeting, cloning, chimera
formation, and transgenic animal production.

Current perspectives of the signaling pathways directing neural crest induction.

Stuhlmiller TJ(1), García-Castro MI.

The neural crest is a migratory population of embryonic cells with a tremendous
potential to differentiate and contribute to nearly every organ system in the
adult body. Over the past two decades, an incredible amount of research has given
us a reasonable understanding of how these cells are generated. Neural crest
induction involves the combinatorial input of multiple signaling pathways and
transcription factors, and is thought to occur in two phases from gastrulation to
neurulation. In the first phase, FGF and Wnt signaling induce NC progenitors at
the border of the neural plate, activating the expression of members of the Msx, 
Pax, and Zic families, among others. In the second phase, BMP, Wnt, and Notch
signaling maintain these progenitors and bring about the expression of definitive
NC markers including Snail2, FoxD3, and Sox9/10. In recent years, additional
signaling molecules and modulators of these pathways have been uncovered,
creating an increasingly complex regulatory network. In this work, we provide a
comprehensive review of the major signaling pathways that participate in neural
crest induction, with a focus on recent developments and current perspectives. We
provide a simplified model of early neural crest development and stress
similarities and differences between four major model organisms: Xenopus, chick, 
zebrafish, and mouse.

c-Maf is required for the development of dorsal horn laminae III/IV neurons and
mechanoreceptive DRG axon projections.

Establishment of proper connectivity between peripheral sensory neurons and their
central targets is required for an animal to sense and respond to various
external stimuli. Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons convey sensory signals of
different modalities via their axon projections to distinct laminae in the dorsal
horn of the spinal cord. In this study, we found that c-Maf was expressed
predominantly in the interneurons of laminae III/IV, which primarily receive
inputs from mechanoreceptive DRG neurons. In the DRG, c-Maf<U+207A> neurons also
coexpressed neurofilament-200, a marker for the medium- and large-diameter
myelinated afferents that transmit non-noxious information. Furthermore, mouse
embryos deficient in c-Maf displayed abnormal development of dorsal horn laminae 
III/IV neurons, as revealed by the marked reduction in the expression of several 
marker genes for these neurons, including those for transcription factors MafA
and Rora, GABA(A) receptor subunit a5, and neuropeptide cholecystokinin. In
addition, among the four major subpopulations of DRG neurons marked by expression
of TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, and MafA/GFRa2/Ret, c-Maf was required selectively for the
proper differentiation of MafA<U+207A>/Ret<U+207A>/GFRa2<U+207A> low-threshold mechanoreceptors
(LTMs). Last, we found that the central and peripheral projections of
mechanoreceptive DRG neurons were compromised in c-Maf deletion mice. Together,
our results indicate that c-Maf is required for the proper development of
MafA<U+207A>/Ret<U+207A>/GFRa2<U+207A> LTMs in the DRG, their afferent projections in the dorsal horn 
and Pacinian corpuscles, as well as neurons in laminae III/IV of the spinal cord.

BACKGROUND: Omphalocele is a congenital birth defect characterised by the
presence of internal organs located outside of the ventral abdominal wall. The
purpose of this study was to identify the underlying genetic mechanisms of a
large autosomal dominant Caucasian family with omphalocele.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A genetic linkage study was conducted in a large family
with an autosomal dominant transmission of an omphalocele using a genome-wide
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. The analysis revealed significant
evidence of linkage (non-parametric NPL = 6.93, p=0.0001; parametric logarithm of
odds (LOD) = 2.70 under a fully penetrant dominant model) at chromosome band
1p31.3. Haplotype analysis narrowed the locus to a 2.74 Mb region between markers
rs2886770 (63014807 bp) and rs1343981 (65757349 bp). Molecular characterisation
of this interval using array comparative genomic hybridisation followed by
quantitative microsphere hybridisation analysis revealed a 710 kb duplication
located at 63.5-64.2 Mb. All affected individuals who had an omphalocele and
shared the haplotype were positive for this duplicated region, while the
duplication was absent from all normal individuals of this family. Multipoint
linkage analysis using the duplication as a marker yielded a maximum LOD score of
3.2 at 1p31.3 under a dominant model. The 710 kb duplication at 1p31.3 band
contains seven known genes including FOXD3, ALG6, ITGB3BP, KIAA1799, DLEU2L,
PGM1, and the proximal portion of ROR1. Importantly, this duplication is absent
from the database of genomic variants.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that development of an omphalocele in
this family is controlled by overexpression of one or more genes in the
duplicated region. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported
association of an inherited omphalocele condition with a chromosomal
rearrangement.

Zebrafish arl6ip1 is required for neural crest development during embryogenesis.

Tu CT(1), Yang TC, Huang HY, Tsai HJ.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, National Taiwan University,
Taipei, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: Although the embryonic expression pattern of ADP ribosylation
factor-like 6 interacting protein 1 (Arl6ip1) has been reported, its function in 
neural crest development is unclear.
METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found that knockdown of Arl6ip1 caused defective
embryonic neural crest derivatives that were particularly severe in craniofacial 
cartilages. Expressions of the ectodermal patterning factors msxb, dlx3b, and
pax3 were normal, but the expressions of the neural crest specifier genes foxd3, 
snai1b, and sox10 were greatly reduced. These findings suggest that arl6ip1 is
essential for specification of neural crest derivatives, but not neural crest
induction. Furthermore, we revealed that the streams of crestin- and
sox10-expressing neural crest cells, which migrate ventrally from neural tube
into trunk, were disrupted in arl6ip1 morphants. This migration defect was not
only in the trunk neural crest, but also in the enteric tract where the
vagal-derived neural crest cells failed to populate the enteric nervous system.
We found that this migration defect was induced by dampened Shh signaling, which 
may have resulted from defective cilia. These data further suggested that arl6ip1
is required for neural crest migration. Finally, by double-staining of TUNEL and 
crestin, we confirmed that the loss of neural crest cells could not be attributed
to apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Therefore, we concluded that arl6ip1 is required for
neural crest migration and sublineage specification.

Prostaglandin E2 maintains mouse ESC undifferentiated state through regulation of
connexin31, connexin43 and connexin45 expression: involvement of glycogen
synthase kinase 3ß/ß-catenin.

National University, Gwangju 500-757, Republic of Korea.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Although previous reports have examined the function of
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on gap junctions and undifferentiated stem cells, its
effects on the reciprocal action of connexin (Cx) isoforms and undifferentiation 
in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are unclear. Therefore, we investigated the role
of PGE2 on Cx isoforms and maintenance of mouse ESC undifferentiated state.
RESULTS: We have analysed 10 Cx genes, but found nine of them. PGE2 (50<U+2009>µM)
stimulated Cx31, Cx32, Cx40, Cx43 and Cx45 mRNA expression. Amongst them, PGE2
maximally stimulated the Cx43 mRNA expression and gap junction inter-cellular
coupling. Therefore, we investigated the effect of PGE2 on Cx43 expression. PGE2 
activated cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)/Akt phosphorylation. In addition, treatments of adenylate cyclase
activators increased Cx43 expression, but not PI3K/Akt phosphorylation. PGE2 also
inactivated GSK-3ß and stimulated active-ß-catenin. Furthermore, a ChiP assay
demonstrated the association of ß-catenin with the Cx26 (as control) and Cx43
promoter. Finally, down-regulation of PGE2-induced Cx isoforms by AH 6809, Cx31-,
Cx43-, Cx45 small interfering (si)RNA and 18a-glycyrrhetinic acid decreased
levels of undifferentiated markers of ESCs, including Oct4, FoxD3, Sox2 and
SSEA-1, but Nanog did not be down-regulated by Cx43 siRNA.
CONCLUSIONS: PGE2 stimulates Cx isoforms via GSK-3ß/ß-catenin via
EP2-receptor-dependent cAMP/PKA and PI3K/Akt in mouse ESCs, thereby partially
contributing to the maintenance of their undifferentiated state.

Ectopically, expression of defined factors could reprogram mammalian somatic
cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which initiates a new strategy
to obtain pluripotent stem cell lines. Attempts have been made to generate
buffalo pluripotent stem cells by culturing primary germ cells or inner cell
mass, but the efficiency is extremely low. Here, we report a successful method to
reprogram buffalo fetal fibroblasts (BFFs) into pluripotent stem cells [buffalo
induced pluripotent stem cell (biPSCs)] by transduction of buffalo defined
factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) using retroviral vectors. The established
biPSCs displayed typical morphological characteristics of pluripotent stem cells,
normal karyotype, positive staining of alkaline phosphatase, and expressed
pluripotent markers including Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Lin28, E-Cadherin, SSEA-1,
SSEA-4, TRA-1-81, STAT3, and FOXD3. They could form embryoid bodies (EBs) in
vitro and teratomas after injecting into the nude BALB/C mice, and 3 germ layers 
were identified in the EBs and teratomas. Methylation assay revealed that the
promoters of Oct4 and Nanog were hypomethylated in biPSCs compared with BFFs and 
pre-biPSCs, while the promoters of Sox2 and E-Cadherin were hypomethylated in
both BFFs and biPSCs. Further, inhibiting p53 expression by coexpression of SV40 
large T antigen and buffalo defined factors in BFFs or treating BFFs with p53
inhibitor pifithrin-a (PFT) could increase the efficiency of biPSCs generation up
to 3-fold, and nuclear transfer embryos reconstructed with biPSCs could develop
to blastocysts. These results indicate that BFFs can be reprogrammed into biPSCs 
by buffalo defined factors, and the generation efficiency of biPSCs can be
increased by inhibition of p53 expression. These efforts will provide a feasible 
approach for investigating buffalo stem cell signal pathways, establishing
buffalo stem cell lines, and producing genetic modification buffaloes in the
future.

Reciprocal effects of NNK and SLURP-1 on oncogene expression in target epithelial
cells.

Kalantari-Dehaghi M(1), Bernard HU, Grando SA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Dermatology, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697, USA.

AIMS: To elucidate how the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed on
bronchial and oral epithelial cells targeted by the tobacco nitrosamine
(4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone) (NNK) facilitate carcinogenic
transformation.
MAIN METHODS: Since NNK-dependent transformation can be abolished by the
nicotinergic secreted mammalian Ly-6/urokinase plasminogen activator receptor
related protein-1 (SLURP-1), we compared effects of NNK and recombinant
(r)SLURP-1 on the expression of genes related to tumorigenesis in human
immortalized bronchial and oral epithelial cell lines BEP2D and Het-1A,
respectively.
KEY FINDINGS: NNK stimulated expression of oncogenic genes, including MYB and
PIK3CA in BEP2D, ETS1, NRAS and SRC in Het-1A, and AKT1, KIT and RB1 in both cell
types, which could be abolished in the presence of rSLURP-1. Other cancer-related
genes whose upregulation by NNK was abolishable by rSLURP-1 were the growth
factors EGF in BEP2D cells and HGF in Het-1A cells, and the transcription factors
CDKN2A and STAT3 (Het-1A only). NNK also upregulated the anti-apoptotic BCL2
(Het-1A) and downregulated the pro-apoptotic TNF (Het-1A), BAX and CASP8 (BEP2D),
all of which could be abolished, in part, by rSLURP-1. NNK decreased expression
of the CTNNB1 gene encoding the intercellular adhesion molecule ß-catenin
(BEP2D), as well as tumor suppressors CDKN3 and FOXD3 in BEP2D cells and SERPINB5
in Het-1A cells. These pro-oncogenic effects of NNK were abolished by rSLURP-1
that also upregulated RUNX3.
SIGNIFICANCE: The obtained results identified target genes for both NNK and
SLURP-1 and shed light on the molecular mechanism of their reciprocal effects on 
tumorigenic transformation of bronchial and oral epithelial cells.

Formation of higher-order structure of nucleic acids (hairpins or loops, for
example) may impact not only gene regulation, but also molecular biology
techniques and approaches critical for design and production of vectors needed
for genetic engineering approaches. In the course of designing vectors aimed to
modify the murine Foxd3 locus through homologous recombination in embryonic stem 
cells, we discovered a 370 nucleotide segment of DNA resistant to polymerase
read-through. In addition to sequencing and PCR disruptions, we were unable to
use BAC recombineering strategies to exchange sequences within the Foxd3 locus.
This segment corresponds to a putative DNA hairpin region just upstream of the 5'
untranslated region of Foxd3. This region is also highly conserved across
vertebrate species, suggesting possible functional significance. Our findings
provide a cautionary note for researchers experiencing technical challenges with 
BAC recombineering or other molecular biology methods requiring recombination or 
polymerase activity.

Identification of Rhit as a novel transcriptional repressor of human Mpv17-like
protein with a mitigating effect on mitochondrial dysfunction, and its
transcriptional regulation by FOXD3 and GABP.

Mpv17-like protein (M-LP) is a protein that has been suggested to be involved in 
the metabolism of reactive oxygen species. To elucidate the molecular basis of
M-LP expression, we recently searched for regulatory elements of M-LP and
identified a novel mouse KRAB-containing protein, Rhit (regulator of heat-induced
transcription), as a repressor of the transcriptional regulation of M-LP. In this
study, we identified zinc-finger protein 205 as a candidate human Rhit (RhitH)
and subsequently confirmed its participation in transcriptional regulation of
human M-LP (M-LPH). To clarify the functions of RhitH and M-LPH, we searched for 
cis-regulatory elements in the promoter region of RhitH and identified two
transcription factors: forkhead box D3, as a negative regulatory element, and
GA-binding protein, one of the key regulators of the mitochondrial electron
transport system, as a positive regulatory element. Additionally, it was
demonstrated that knockdown of RhitH or overexpression of M-LPH reduces the
generation of intracellular H(2)O(2) and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential
caused by an inhibitor of the respiratory chain, antimycin A. These results
suggest that M-LPH functions to protect cells from oxidative stress and/or
initiation of the mitochondrial apoptotic cascade under stressed conditions.

Enteric nervous system specific deletion of Foxd3 disrupts glial cell
differentiation and activates compensatory enteric progenitors.

The enteric nervous system (ENS) arises from the coordinated migration, expansion
and differentiation of vagal and sacral neural crest progenitor cells. During
development, vagal neural crest cells enter the foregut and migrate in a
rostro-to-caudal direction, colonizing the entire gastrointestinal tract and
generating the majority of the ENS. Sacral neural crest contributes to a subset
of enteric ganglia in the hindgut, colonizing the colon in a caudal-to-rostral
wave. During this process, enteric neural crest-derived progenitors (ENPs)
self-renew and begin expressing markers of neural and glial lineages as they
populate the intestine. Our earlier work demonstrated that the transcription
factor Foxd3 is required early in neural crest-derived progenitors for
self-renewal, multipotency and establishment of multiple neural crest-derived
cells and structures including the ENS. Here, we describe Foxd3 expression within
the fetal and postnatal intestine: Foxd3 was strongly expressed in ENPs as they
colonize the gastrointestinal tract and was progressively restricted to enteric
glial cells. Using a novel Ednrb-iCre transgene to delete Foxd3 after vagal
neural crest cells migrate into the midgut, we demonstrated a late temporal
requirement for Foxd3 during ENS development. Lineage labeling of Ednrb-iCre
expressing cells in Foxd3 mutant embryos revealed a reduction of ENPs throughout 
the gut and loss of Ednrb-iCre lineage cells in the distal colon. Although mutant
mice were viable, defects in patterning and distribution of ENPs were associated 
with reduced proliferation and severe reduction of glial cells derived from the
Ednrb-iCre lineage. Analyses of ENS-lineage and differentiation in mutant embryos
suggested activation of a compensatory population of Foxd3-positive ENPs that did
not express the Ednrb-iCre transgene. Our findings highlight the crucial roles
played by Foxd3 during ENS development including progenitor proliferation, neural
patterning, and glial differentiation and may help delineate distinct molecular
programs controlling vagal versus sacral neural crest development.

The spinal cord contains a diverse array of physiologically distinct interneuron 
cell types that subserve specialized roles in somatosensory perception and motor 
control. The mechanisms that generate these specialized interneuronal cell types 
from multipotential spinal progenitors are not known. In this study, we describe 
a temporally regulated transcriptional program that controls the differentiation 
of Renshaw cells (RCs), an anatomically and functionally discrete spinal
interneuron subtype. We show that the selective activation of the Onecut
transcription factors Oc1 and Oc2 during the first wave of V1 interneuron
neurogenesis is a key step in the RC differentiation program. The development of 
RCs is additionally dependent on the forkhead transcription factor Foxd3, which
is more broadly expressed in postmitotic V1 interneurons. Our demonstration that 
RCs are born, and activate Oc1 and Oc2 expression, in a narrow temporal window
leads us to posit that neuronal diversity in the developing spinal cord is
established by the composite actions of early spatial and temporal determinants.

(B-RAF) are highly resistant to chemotherapeutic treatments. Recent phase 1
results with PLX4032/RG7204/vemurafenib, which selectively inhibits
B-RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling in mutant B-RAF cells, has given
encouragement to this struggling field. Nearly all patients in the phase 1-3
studies saw at least some response and the overall response rates ranged from 48 
and 81%. However, despite initial tumor shrinkage, most responders in the trial
experienced tumor relapse over time. These findings indicate that both intrinsic 
and acquired resistance may affect the clinical efficacy of PLX4032. It is
critical to optimize PLX4032 activity to improve response rates and understand
why some patients with the B-RAF mutation do not respond. We have previously
shown that the stemness factor, Forkhead box D3 (FOXD3), is upregulated following
inhibition of B-RAF-MEK signaling in mutant B-RAF melanoma cells. Here, we show
that upregulation of FOXD3 following treatment with PLX4032 and PLX4720 (the
non-clinical tool compound for PLX4032) confers resistance to cell death. Small
interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of FOXD3 significantly enhanced the cell death
response after PLX4032/4720 treatment in mutant B-RAF melanoma cell lines.
Additionally, upregulation of FOXD3 after PLX4720 treatment was attenuated in
non-adherent conditions and correlated with enhanced cell death. Ectopic
expression of FOXD3 in non-adherent cells significantly reduced cell death in
response to PLX4720 treatment. Together, these data indicate that upregulation of
FOXD3 is an adaptive response to RAF inhibitors that promotes a state of drug
resistance.

Tfap2a and Foxd3 regulate early steps in the development of the neural crest
progenitor population.

The neural crest is a stem cell-like population exclusive to vertebrates that
gives rise to many different cell types including chondrocytes, neurons and
melanocytes. Arising from the neural plate border at the intersection of Wnt and 
Bmp signaling pathways, the complexity of neural crest gene regulatory networks
has made the earliest steps of induction difficult to elucidate. Here, we report 
that tfap2a and foxd3 participate in neural crest induction and are necessary and
sufficient for this process to proceed. Double mutant tfap2a (mont blanc, mob)
and foxd3 (mother superior, mos) mob;mos zebrafish embryos completely lack all
neural crest-derived tissues. Moreover, tfap2a and foxd3 are expressed during
gastrulation prior to neural crest induction in distinct, complementary, domains;
tfap2a is expressed in the ventral non-neural ectoderm and foxd3 in the dorsal
mesendoderm and ectoderm. We further show that Bmp signaling is expanded in
mob;mos embryos while expression of dkk1, a Wnt signaling inhibitor, is increased
and canonical Wnt targets are suppressed. These changes in Bmp and Wnt signaling 
result in specific perturbations of neural crest induction rather than general
defects in neural plate border or dorso-ventral patterning. foxd3 overexpression,
on the other hand, enhances the ability of tfap2a to ectopically induce neural
crest around the neural plate, overriding the normal neural plate border limit of
the early neural crest territory. Although loss of either Tfap2a or Foxd3 alters 
Bmp and Wnt signaling patterns, only their combined inactivation sufficiently
alters these signaling gradients to abort neural crest induction. Collectively,
our results indicate that tfap2a and foxd3, in addition to their respective roles
in the differentiation of neural crest derivatives, also jointly maintain the
balance of Bmp and Wnt signaling in order to delineate the neural crest induction
domain.

Loss of Foxd3 results in decreased ß-cell proliferation and glucose intolerance
during pregnancy.

A complete molecular understanding of ß-cell mass expansion will be useful for
the improvement of therapies to treat diabetic patients. During normal periods of
metabolic challenges, such as pregnancy, ß-cells proliferate, or self-renew, to
meet the new physiological demands. The transcription factor Forkhead box D3
(Foxd3) is required for maintenance and self-renewal of several diverse
progenitor cell lineages, and Foxd3 is expressed in the pancreatic primordium
beginning at 10.5 d postcoitum, becoming localized predominantly to ß-cells after
birth. Here, we show that mice carrying a pancreas-specific deletion of Foxd3
have impaired glucose tolerance, decreased ß-cell mass, decreased ß-cell
proliferation, and decreased ß-cell size during pregnancy. In addition, several
genes known to regulate proliferation, Foxm1, Skp2, Ezh2, Akt2, and Cdkn1a, are
misregulated in islets isolated from these Foxd3 mutant mice. Together, these
data place Foxd3 upstream of several pathways critical for ß-cell mass expansion 
in vivo.

Transcription factor Sox10 orchestrates activity of a neural crest-specific
enhancer in the vicinity of its gene.

The Sox10 transcription factor is a central regulator of vertebrate neural crest 
and nervous system development. Its expression is likely controlled by multiple
enhancer elements, among them U3 (alternatively known as MCS4). Here we analyze
U3 activity to obtain deeper insights into Sox10 function and expression in the
neural crest and its derivatives. U3 activity strongly depends on the presence of
Sox10 that regulates its own expression as commonly observed for important
developmental regulators. Sox10 bound directly as monomer to at least three sites
in U3, whereas a fourth site preferred dimers. Deletion of these sites
efficiently reduced U3 activity in transfected cells and transgenic mice. In
stimulating the U3 enhancer, Sox10 synergized with many other transcription
factors present in neural crest and developing peripheral nervous system
including Pax3, FoxD3, AP2a, Krox20 and Sox2. In case of FoxD3, synergism
involved Sox10-dependent recruitment to the U3 enhancer, while Sox10 and AP2a
each had to bind to the regulatory region. Our study points to the importance of 
autoregulatory activity and synergistic interactions for maintenance of Sox10
expression and functional activity of Sox10 in the neural crest regulatory
network.

Transcriptional changes of secreted Wnt antagonists in hindlimb skeletal muscle
during the lifetime of the C57BL/6J mouse.

The canonical Wnt pathway plays a critical role in myogenesis and age-related
inefficient muscle regeneration. To gain insights into changes in Wnt signaling
in muscle during the lifetime of a mouse, mRNA levels of secreted Wnt antagonists
were investigated. Among 13 analyzed antagonists, seven genes were found to be
down-regulated in skeletal muscles of adult and old mice. Epigenetic
modifications at the promoter regions of these seven Wnt antagonists were then
examined to understand how these correlate with this transcriptional repression. 
DNA methylation was stably maintained, while chromatin modifications changed to
transcriptionally inactive states over the course of a lifetime. Similar patterns
of changes in chromatin modifications were observed at the promoters of all of
the studied genes. The observations indicated that an upstream factor might
regulate the chromatin states and the transcriptional repression of Wnt
antagonists. Several bioinformatic analyses revealed that a FOXD3 binding motif
is present within promoter regions of the seven antagonists. Furthermore,
age-dependent differential FOXD3 binding is observed at the motifs of the seven
gene promoters. Our results suggest that FOXD3 as a potential epigenetic
regulator may mediate the transcriptional repression of the seven antagonists,
possibly through regulation of histone modifications.

Identification of novel Hoxa1 downstream targets regulating hindbrain, neural
crest and inner ear development.

Makki N(1), Capecchi MR.

Author information: 
(1)Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Human Genetics, UT, USA.

Hox genes play a crucial role during embryonic patterning and organogenesis. Of
the 39 Hox genes, Hoxa1 is the first to be expressed during embryogenesis and the
only anterior Hox gene linked to a human syndrome. Hoxa1 is necessary for the
proper development of the brainstem, inner ear and heart in humans and mice;
however, almost nothing is known about the molecular downstream targets through
which it exerts its function. To gain insight into the transcriptional network
regulated by this protein, we performed microarray analysis on tissue
microdissected from the prospective rhombomere 3-5 region of Hoxa1 null and wild 
type embryos. Due to the very early and transient expression of this gene,
dissections were performed on early somite stage embryos during an eight-hour
time window of development. Our array yielded a list of around 300 genes
differentially expressed between the two samples. Many of the identified genes
play a role in a specific developmental or cellular process. Some of the
validated targets regulate early neural crest induction and specification.
Interestingly, three of these genes, Zic1, Hnf1b and Foxd3, were down-regulated
in the posterior hindbrain, where cardiac neural crest cells arise, which pattern
the outflow tract of the heart. Other targets are necessary for early inner ear
development, e.g. Pax8 and Fgfr3 or are expressed in specific hindbrain neurons
regulating respiration, e.g. Lhx5. These findings allow us to propose a model
where Hoxa1 acts in a genetic cascade upstream of genes controlling specific
aspects of embryonic development, thereby providing insight into possible
mechanisms underlying the human HoxA1-syndrome.

Diverse mechanisms for assembly of branchiomeric nerves.

Author information:

University School of Medicine, 1402 S. Grand Blvd, St. Louis, MO 63104, USA.

The formation of branchiomeric nerves (cranial nerves V, VII, IX and X) from
their sensory, motor and glial components is poorly understood. The current model
for cranial nerve formation is based on the Vth nerve, in which sensory afferents
are formed first and must enter the hindbrain in order for the motor efferents to
exit. Using transgenic zebrafish lines to discriminate between motor neurons,
sensory neurons and peripheral glia, we show that this model does not apply to
the remaining three branchiomeric nerves. For these nerves, the motor efferents
form prior to the sensory afferents, and their pathfinding show no dependence on 
sensory axons, as ablation of cranial sensory neurons by ngn1 knockdown had no
effect. In contrast, the sensory limbs of the IXth and Xth nerves (but not the
Vth or VIIth) were misrouted in gli1 mutants, which lack hindbrain bmn,
suggesting that the motor efferents are crucial for appropriate sensory axon
projection in some branchiomeric nerves. For all four nerves, peripheral glia
were the intermediate component added and had a critical role in nerve integrity 
but not in axon guidance, as foxd3 null mutants lacking peripheral glia exhibited
defasciculation of gVII, gIX, and gX axons. The bmn efferents were unaffected in 
these mutants. These data demonstrate that multiple mechanisms underlie formation
of the four branchiomeric nerves. For the Vth, sensory axons initiate nerve
formation, for the VIIth the sensory and motor limbs are independent, and for the
IXth/Xth the motor axons initiate formation. In all cases the glia are patterned 
by the initiating set of axons and are needed to maintain axon fasciculation.
These results reveal that coordinated interactions between the three neural cell 
types in branchiomeric nerves differ according to their axial position.

Update on the genetics characterization of vitiligo.

Al-Shobaili HA(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Dermatology, College of Medicine, Qassim University, Saudi
Arabia.

Vitiligo is an autoimmune skin disorder in which autoimmune-mediated destruction 
of melanocytes caused depigmentation of skin patches. The complex genetics of
vitiligo involves multiple susceptibility loci, genetic heterogeneity and
incomplete penetrance with gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. In order 
to clarify the genetic factors, two different principal approaches have applied
for the identification of genomic regions or candidate genes that mediate
susceptibility to vitiligo. First approach is the genome-wide linkage analyses,
which is conducted by scanning of entire human genome for genomic regions that
are linked to the development of vitiligo. The other approach is functional
candidate gene association (FCGA) analyses that detect specific candidate genes, 
which are expected to involve in disease on the basis of their priori biological 
functions. Genomic-wide scans have provided a strong support for vitiligo
susceptibility genes on chromosomes 4q13-q21, 1p31, 7q22, 8p12 and 17p13, while
loci of interest at 6p, 6q, 14q, 9q, 13q, 19p and 22q required further follow-up.
Whereas, FCGA studies have identified some candidate genes which are associated
with vitiligo, such as HLA, AIRE, VIT1, CAT, FOXD3, ESR1, COMT, PTPN22, NALP1,
PDGFRA, MYG1, MITF, CD117, XBP1, FAS, COX2, EDN1 and ACE, but few of them reports
now appear to be false-positive. This review will provides an update on genetics 
of vitiligo based on the identification of novel candidate genes that represent, 
in my opinion as optimal utility for future therapeutic targets in the
pathogenesis of vitiligo.

OBJECTIVE: The molecular mechanisms that maintain human pluripotent stem (PS)
cells are not completely understood. Here we sought to identify new candidate PS 
cell regulators to facilitate future improvements in their generation, expansion,
and differentiation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used bioinformatic analyses of multiple
serial-analysis-of-gene-expression libraries (generated from human PS cells and
their differentiated derivatives), together with small interfering RNA (siRNA)
screening to identify candidate pluripotency regulators. Validation of candidate 
regulators involved promoter analyses, Affymetrix profiling, real-time PCR, and
immunoprecipitation.
RESULTS: Promoter analysis of genes differentially expressed across multiple
serial-analysis-of-gene-expression libraries identified E2F motifs in the
promoters of many PS cell-specific genes (e.g., POU5F1, NANOG, SOX2, FOXD3).
siRNA analyses identified two retinoblastoma binding proteins (RBBP4, RBBP9) as
required for maintenance of multiple human PS cell types. Both RBBPs were bound
to RB in human PS cells, and E2F motifs were present in the promoters of genes
whose expression was altered by decreasing RBBP4 and RBBP9 expression. Affymetrix
and real-time PCR studies of siRNA-treated human PS cells showed that reduced
RBBP4 or RBBP9 expression concomitantly decreased expression of POU5F1, NANOG,
SOX2, and/or FOXD3 plus certain cell cycle genes (e.g., CCNA2, CCNB1), while
increasing expression of genes involved in organogenesis (particularly
neurogenesis).
CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal new candidate positive regulators of human PS
cells, providing evidence of their ability to regulate expression of
pluripotency, cell cycle, and differentiation genes in human PS cells. These data
provide valuable new leads for further elucidating mechanisms of human
pluripotency.

Activin/Nodal signaling controls divergent transcriptional networks in human
embryonic stem cells and in endoderm progenitors.

Activin/Nodal signaling is necessary to maintain pluripotency of human embryonic 
stem cells (hESCs) and to induce their differentiation toward endoderm. However, 
the mechanisms by which Activin/Nodal signaling achieves these opposite functions
remain unclear. To unravel these mechanisms, we examined the transcriptional
network controlled in hESCs by Smad2 and Smad3, which represent the direct
effectors of Activin/Nodal signaling. These analyses reveal that Smad2/3
participate in the control of the core transcriptional network characterizing
pluripotency, which includes Oct-4, Nanog, FoxD3, Dppa4, Tert, Myc, and UTF1. In 
addition, similar experiments performed on endoderm cells confirm that a broad
part of the transcriptional network directing differentiation is downstream of
Smad2/3. Therefore, Activin/Nodal signaling appears to control divergent
transcriptional networks in hESCs and in endoderm. Importantly, we observed an
overlap between the transcriptional network downstream of Nanog and Smad2/3 in
hESCs; whereas, functional studies showed that both factors cooperate to control 
the expression of pluripotency genes. Therefore, the effect of Activin/Nodal
signaling on pluripotency and differentiation could be dictated by tissue
specific Smad2/3 partners such as Nanog, explaining the mechanisms by which
signaling pathways can orchestrate divergent cell fate decisions.

Peter Pan functions independently of its role in ribosome biogenesis during early
eye and craniofacial cartilage development in Xenopus laevis.

The Xenopus oocyte possesses a large maternal store of ribosomes, thereby
uncoupling early development from the de novo ribosome biosynthesis required for 
cell growth. Brix domain-containing proteins, such as Peter Pan (PPan), are
essential for eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that 
PPan is expressed maternally as well as in the eye and cranial neural crest cells
(NCCs) during early Xenopus laevis development. Depletion of PPan and
interference with rRNA processing using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides
resulted in eye and cranial cartilage malformations. Loss of PPan, but not
interference with rRNA processing, led to an early downregulation of specific
marker genes of the eye, including Rx1 and Pax6, and of NCCs, such as Twist, Slug
and FoxD3. We found that PPan protein is localized in the nucleoli and
mitochondria and that loss of PPan results in increased apoptosis. These findings
indicate a novel function of PPan that is independent of its role in ribosome
biogenesis.

Regulation of melanocyte pivotal transcription factor MITF by some other
transcription factors.

College, Xichang Road 295#, Kunming, 650032 Yunnan, China. wanpingdr@163.com

The microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF) is discussed as the master gene
for melanocytic survival and a key transcription factor regulating the expression
of tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1), and tyrosinase-related
protein-2 (TRP-2). MITF is influenced in a complex manner by a large number of
different extracellular and intracellular proteins. Many transcription factors
are able to modulate the expression and/or transcriptional activity of MITF in
vivo. In this review, we summarize these transcription factors that regulate MITF
and their interactions. The Sry-related HMG box 10 (SOX10) can directly
transactivate the MITF gene and cooperate with MITF to activate TRP-2 expression.
The Paired box 3 (PAX3) can increase MITF expression by binding to its promoter
and simultaneously prevent MITF from activating downstream genes by competition
for enhancer occupancy. Activated signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT3) and protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3) are able
to regulate transcriptional activity of MITF through their interaction. Activated
cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) can bind the cAMP response element
to increase the MITF gene expression. MITF expression can also be initiated by
lymphoid-enhancing factor-1 (LEF-1) and be temporally facilitated by the synergy 
of LEF-1 and MITF. Both immunoglobulin transcription factor-2 (ITF2) and
forkhead-box transcription factor D3 (FOXD3) can negatively regulate MITF
expression. All the above-mentioned transcription factors constitute a regulatory
network that precisely modulates the MITF.

ErbB signaling has a role in radial sorting independent of Schwann cell number.

Raphael AR(1), Lyons DA, Talbot WS.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Developmental Biology, Stanford University, Stanford,
California, USA.

In the peripheral nervous system, Schwann cells make myelin, a specialized sheath
that is essential for rapid axonal conduction of action potentials. Immature
Schwann cells initially interact with many axons, but, through a process termed
radial sorting, eventually interact with one segment of a single axon as
promyelinating Schwann cells. Previous studies have identified genes that are
required for Schwann cell process extension and proliferation during radial
sorting. Previous analyses also show that ErbB signaling is required for Schwann 
cell proliferation, myelination, radial sorting, and the proper formation of
unmyelinated Remak bundles. Because ErbB signaling and Schwann cell proliferation
are both required during radial sorting, we sought to determine if the primary
function of ErbB signaling in this process is to regulate Schwann cell
proliferation or if ErbB signaling also controls other aspects of radial sorting.
To address this question, we applied small molecule inhibitors in vivo in
zebrafish to independently block ErbB signaling and proliferation.
Ultrastructural analysis of treated animals revealed that both ErbB signaling and
Schwann cell proliferation are required for radial sorting in vivo. ErbB
signaling, however, is required for Schwann cell process extension, while Schwann
cell proliferation is not. These results provide in vivo evidence that ErbB
signaling plays a direct role in process extension during radial sorting, in
addition to its role in regulating Schwann cell proliferation.

As one member of winged helix domain transcription factors, FoxD3 plays an
important role in the regulation of neural crest development and maintenance of
mammalian stem cell lineages. A recent study showed that zebrafish FoxD3 is a
downstream gene of Pax3 and can mediate the expression of Myf5. To further
understand the function of FoxD3 in fish muscle development, we isolated the
FoxD3 gene from flounder, and analyzed its expression pattern and function in
regulating myogenic regulatory factors, MyoD and Myf5. In situ hybridization
showed that flounder FoxD3 was firstly detected in the premigratory neural crest 
cells at 90% epiboly stage. The FoxD3 was expressed not only in neural crest
cells but also in somite cells that will form muscle in the future. When flounder
FoxD3 was over-expressed in zebrafish by microinjection, the expressions of
zebrafish Myf5 and MyoD were both affected. It is possible that FoxD3 is involved
in myogenesis by regulating the expression of Myf5 and MyoD. Also,
over-expression of flounder FoxD3 in zebrafish inhibits the expression of
zebrafish endogenic FoxD3.

FOXD3 regulates migration properties and Rnd3 expression in melanoma cells.

Katiyar P(1), Aplin AE.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cancer Biology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Jefferson Medical College,
Thomas Jefferson University, 233 South 10th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.

Forkhead transcription factor, Foxd3, plays a critical role during development by
controlling the lineage specification of neural crest cells. Notably, Foxd3 is
highly expressed during the wave of neural crest cell migration that forms
peripheral neurons and glial cells but is downregulated prior to migration of
cells that give rise to the melanocytic lineage. Melanoma is the deadliest form
of skin cancer and is derived from melanocytes. Recently, we showed that FOXD3
expression is elevated following the targeted inhibition of the B-RAF-MEK
(MAP/ERK kinase)-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase)1/2 pathway in mutant
B-RAF melanoma cells. Because melanoma cells are highly migratory and invasive in
a B-RAF-dependent manner, we explored the role of FOXD3 in these processes. In
this study, we show that ectopic FOXD3 expression inhibits the migration,
invasion, and spheroid outgrowth of mutant B-RAF melanoma cells. Upregulation of 
FOXD3 expression following inhibition of B-RAF and MEK correlates with the
downregulation of Rnd3, a Rho GTPase and inhibitor of RhoA-ROCK signaling.
Indeed, expression of FOXD3 alone was sufficient to downregulate Rnd3 expression 
at the mRNA and protein levels. Mechanistically, FOXD3 was found to be recruited 
to the Rnd3 promoter. Inhibition of ROCK partially restored migration in
FOXD3-expressing cells. These data show that FOXD3 expression downregulates
migration and invasion in melanoma cells and Rnd3, a target known to be involved 
in these properties.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the methylation patterns of four pluripotency gene promoters
in mouse oocytes after in vivo maturation, in vitro maturation (IVM), and
vitrification followed by IVM.
DESIGN: Experimental study.
SETTING: Research laboratory.
ANIMAL(S): Three populations of metaphase II mouse oocytes were analyzed after in
vivo maturation, IVM, and vitrification followed by IVM (V-IVM). Cumulus cells
and blastocyst embryos were controls.
INTERVENTION(S): The CpG methylation patterns (overall and CpG specific) in the
promoters of four pluripotency genes (Oct4, Nanog, Foxd3, and Sox2) were analyzed
for each cell type by traditional DNA bisulfite sequencing.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Differences for overall methylation were evaluated using
the Student's t-test and for individual CpG sites by <U+03C7>2 analysis.
RESULT(S): Significantly lower levels of overall methylation in promoters of Oct4
(25%) and Sox2 (4.5%) were noted in V-IVM oocytes compared with in vivo-matured
oocytes (62.5% and 8.5%, respectively). Cumulus cell promoters were generally
hypomethylated at Nanog, Foxd3. and Sox2, but hypermethylated at Oct4.
CONCLUSION(S): The methylation status of Oct4 and Sox2 promoters of V-IVM mouse
oocytes are altered when compared with in vivo-matured oocytes. The biological
risk and significance of these changes are unknown and this study indicates
caution and that further analyses are warranted.

The neural crest is a transient structure in vertebrate embryos that generates
multiple neural and mesenchymal cell types as well as melanocytes. Melanocytes in
the skin either derive directly from neural crest cells populating the skin via a
dorsolateral migratory pathway or arise by detaching from nerves innervating the 
skin. Several transcription factors, such as FoxD3, Sox10, Pax3, and Mitf, take
part in a genetic network regulating melanocyte formation from the neural crest. 
The activity of these intrinsic factors is controlled and modulated by
extracellular signals including canonical Wnt, Edn, Kitl, and other signals that 
remain to be identified. Here, we summarize the current view of how melanocytes
are specified from the neural crest and put this process into the context of
spatiotemporal lineage decisions in neural crest cells.

The PI3K-Akt pathway regulates calpain 6 expression, proliferation, and
apoptosis.

The calpains are a family of cysteine proteases involved in some biological
processes whose activities are highly dependent on Ca(2+). Calpain 6 (CAPN6), one
member of the family, is unique in that it lacks the active-site cysteine
residues for protease activity. According to the data that CAPN6 was up-regulated
in the Akt transformed mouse embryonic fibroblast cells by cDNA chip, the
mechanisms underlying elevated CAPN6 expression by PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and
its biological functions were studied. The results showed that CAPN6 was
down-regulated on transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by the PI3K
inhibitor or Akt deletion. CAPN6 protein was stabilized by PI3K-GSK-3ß pathway.
Deleted CAPN6 promoters activity were assessed by dual-luciferase reporter
system, and the founding indicated that -93/+200 DNA fragment was the core
promoter of it. Transcription factor binding sites in the CAPN6 promoter were
mutated and the results showed that AP1, Oct-1, and FoxD3 were the critical
transcription factors in regulation of CAPN6 expression. In addition, CAPN6
promoted cancer cell proliferation and inhibited its apoptosis. The finding
demonstrates that CAPN6 is regulated by the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and
provides evidence that it may be a therapeutic target of cancer.

Functional interaction between Foxd3 and Pax3 in cardiac neural crest
development.

Biology, Center for Stem Cell Biology, Program in Developmental Biology,
Nashville, Tennessee, USA.

The transcription factors Foxd3 and Pax3 are important early regulators of neural
crest (NC) progenitor cell properties. Homozygous mutations of Pax3 or a
homozygous NC-specific deletion of Foxd3 cause marked defects in most NC
derivatives, but neither loss of both Foxd3 alleles nor loss of one Pax3 allele
alone greatly affects overall development of cardiac NC derivatives. In contrast,
compound mutant embryos homozygous for a NC-specific Foxd3 mutation and
heterozygous for Pax3 have fully penetrant persistent truncus arteriosus, severe 
thymus hypoplasia, and midgestation lethality. Foxd3; Pax3 compound mutant
embryos have increased cell death in the neural folds and a drastic early
reduction of NC cells, with an almost complete absence of NC caudal to the first 
pharyngeal arch. The genetic interaction between these genes implicates gene
dosage-sensitive roles for Foxd3 and Pax3 in cardiac NC progenitors. Foxd3 and
Pax3 act together to affect survival and maintenance of cardiac NC progenitors,
and loss of these progenitors catastrophically affects key aspects of later
cardiovascular development.

Neural crest stem cell multipotency requires Foxd3 to maintain neural potential
and repress mesenchymal fates.

Mundell NA(1), Labosky PA.

Author information: 
(1)Center for Stem Cell Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine,
Nashville, TN 37232-0494, USA.

Neural crest (NC) progenitors generate a wide array of cell types, yet molecules 
controlling NC multipotency and self-renewal and factors mediating cell-intrinsic
distinctions between multipotent versus fate-restricted progenitors are poorly
understood. Our earlier work demonstrated that Foxd3 is required for maintenance 
of NC progenitors in the embryo. Here, we show that Foxd3 mediates a fate
restriction choice for multipotent NC progenitors with loss of Foxd3 biasing NC
toward a mesenchymal fate. Neural derivatives of NC were lost in Foxd3 mutant
mouse embryos, whereas abnormally fated NC-derived vascular smooth muscle cells
were ectopically located in the aorta. Cranial NC defects were associated with
precocious differentiation towards osteoblast and chondrocyte cell fates, and
individual mutant NC from different anteroposterior regions underwent fate
changes, losing neural and increasing myofibroblast potential. Our results
demonstrate that neural potential can be separated from NC multipotency by the
action of a single gene, and establish novel parallels between NC and other
progenitor populations that depend on this functionally conserved stem cell
protein to regulate self-renewal and multipotency.

PCL2 modulates gene regulatory networks controlling self-renewal and commitment
in embryonic stem cells.

Recent reports have better elucidated the components of the Polycomb Repressive
Complex 2 (PRC2) and its functional role in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and their
differentiated derivatives. The depletion of a newly described mammalian PRC2
associated protein, PCL2, leads to an increase in ESC self-renewal and a delay in
differentiation, a phenotype similar to knockouts of the core PRC2 members.
Genomic and cell biology data suggest that PCL2 is important in cell fate
decisions and may play a role in recruitment of PRC2 to target genes and histone 
methylation. Importantly, depletion of PCL2 in ESCs leads to a decrease in
3meH3K27 at the proximal promoter regions of pluripotency transcription factors
Tbx3, Klf4, Foxd3 and a concomitant increase in gene expression. These proteins
subsequently activate expression of Oct4, Nanog and Sox2 through a feed-forward
gene regulatory circuit, altering the core pluripotency network and driving cell 
fate decisions towards self-renewal. We propose a model whereby alteration of the
epigenetic state of Tbx3, Klf4, and Foxd3 results in the enforced expression of
the pluripotency network, preventing differentiation.

PAX3 and MITF are important transcriptional activators in the melanocyte lineage 
and PAX3 is thought to control MITF expression during normal melanocyte
differentiation. However, it is not clear whether this is still true in melanoma 
and whether the effects of knockdown of PAX3 on the inhibition of melanoma growth
or survival are by its regulation of MITF. By western blot and quantitative
real-time reverse transcription-PCR, we investigated the relationship between
PAX3 and MITF expression in 27 metastatic melanoma and one immortalized
melanocyte cell lines. All lines were found to express both PAX3 and MITF
proteins but levels varied by 15 fold and more than 100 fold, respectively. The
expression of PAX3 protein was correlated with that of MITF (r=0.75; P<0.001) but
the expression of PAX3 protein and MITF mRNA was not. Immunofluorescence
microscopy showed that individual cells expressed widely differing relative
amounts of PAX3 and MITF protein. By MTT cell proliferation and flow cytometry
assays, both MITF and PAX3 proteins seemed to be functional, as knockdown with
siRNA led to reduced proliferation and induction of apoptosis. However, knockdown
of PAX3 with small interfering RNA did not decrease MITF expression and vice
versa. In one cell line (NZM15), silencing of PAX3 induced terminal
differentiation whereas silencing of MITF induced expression of FOXD3, a
repressor of melanogenesis. The results suggest that the melanoma lines used in
this study show considerable phenotypic variation of expression of these two
transcriptional activators and reflect a deregulation of the developmental
process operating in the genesis of the melanocyte lineage, and that they
probably function independently to enhance the survival of melanoma cells.

Description of the CD133+ subpopulation of the human ovarian cancer cell line
OVCAR3.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) form a very rare population within tumors and possess
the ability to proliferate and self-renew indefinitely. The cluster of
differentiation (CD) 133+ ovarian CSCs (OCSCs) have been identified recently and 
their clinical implications are about to be clarified. In this context, we use
the CD133 antigen as a marker of OCSCs in OVCAR3 cells and show that microRNAs
(miRNAs) are aberrantly expressed in this subpopulation. The OCSCs in the OVCAR3 
cell line were identified by the monoclonal mouse anti-CD133-1 antibody (clone
CD133). Microarray and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) analyses were used to identify miRNAs with altered expression in CD133+ 
cells. The expression levels of dysregulated miRNAs, namely, miR-204, miR-206,
miR-223, miR-9, miR-100, and miR-200c, were examined using TaqMan PCR. The RNA
and protein levels of stem cell-specific genes were examined by real-time RT-PCR 
and western blot analyses. Our results of microarray and real-time RT-PCR
analyses revealed distinct miRNA expression profiles between CD133+ and CD133-
OVCAR3 cells. The expression of stem cell-specific genes, namely, Oct3/4, Sox2,
and Nanog, was higher in CD133+ cells than in CD133- cells while that of FoxD3,
was lower in CD133+ cells than in CD133- cells. In conclusion, our data indicate 
that CD133 expression defines a tumor-initiating subpopulation of cells in the
OVCAR3 cell line. The overall miRNA expression profile of CD133+ OVCAR3 cells was
clearly distinct from that of CD133- OVCAR3 cells, indicating that miRNAs are
involved in the development of this neoplasia and may serve as pertinent
chemotherapeutic targets.

Interactions between cells from the ectoderm and mesoderm influence development
of the endodermally-derived pancreas. While much is known about how mesoderm
regulates pancreatic development, relatively little is understood about how and
when the ectodermally-derived neural crest regulates pancreatic development and
specifically, beta cell maturation. A previous study demonstrated that signals
from the neural crest regulate beta cell proliferation and ultimately, beta cell 
mass. Here, we expand on that work to describe timing of neural crest arrival at 
the developing pancreatic bud and extend our knowledge of the non-cell autonomous
role for neural crest derivatives in the process of beta cell maturation. We
demonstrated that murine neural crest entered the pancreatic mesenchyme between
the 26 and 27 somite stages (approximately 10.0 dpc) and became intermingled with
pancreatic progenitors as the epithelium branched into the surrounding
mesenchyme. Using a neural crest-specific deletion of the Forkhead transcription 
factor Foxd3, we ablated neural crest cells that migrate to the pancreatic
primordium. Consistent with previous data, in the absence of Foxd3, and therefore
the absence of neural crest cells, proliferation of insulin-expressing cells and 
insulin-positive area are increased. Analysis of endocrine cell gene expression
in the absence of neural crest demonstrated that, although the number of
insulin-expressing cells was increased, beta cell maturation was significantly
impaired. Decreased MafA and Pdx1 expression illustrated the defect in beta cell 
maturation; we discovered that without neural crest, there was a reduction in the
percentage of insulin-positive cells that co-expressed Glut2 and Pdx1 compared to
controls. In addition, transmission electron microscopy analyses revealed
decreased numbers of characteristic insulin granules and the presence of abnormal
granules in insulin-expressing cells from mutant embryos. Together, these data
demonstrate that the neural crest is a critical regulator of beta cell
development on two levels: by negatively regulating beta cell proliferation and
by promoting beta cell maturation.

Prohibitin1 acts as a neural crest specifier in Xenopus development by repressing
the transcription factor E2F1.

Schneider M(1), Schambony A, Wedlich D.

Author information: 
(1)KIT, Campus South, Zoologicak Institute, Cell and Developmental Biology,
Kaiserstrasse 12, Karlsruhe, Germany.

Prohibitin 1 (phb1), which was initially described as an inhibitor of cell
proliferation, is a highly conserved protein found in multiple cellular
compartments. In the nucleus it interacts with the transcriptional regulators Rb 
and E2F1 and controls cell proliferation and apoptosis. Here we unravel an
unexpected novel function for phb1 in Xenopus cranial neural crest (CNC)
development. Xphb1 is maternally expressed; zygotically expressed neurula stage
transcripts accumulate in the CNC and the neural tube. Knockdown of Xphb1 by
antisense morpholino injection results in the loss of foxD3, snail2 and twist
expression, whereas expression of c-myc, AP-2 and snail1 remains unaffected.
Xphb2, its closest relative, cannot substitute for Xphb1, underlining the
specificity of Xphb1 function. Epistatic analyses place Xphb1 downstream of c-myc
and upstream of foxD3, snail2 and twist. To elucidate which subdomain in Xphb1 is
required for neural crest gene regulation we generated deletion mutants and
tested their rescue ability in Xphb1 morphants. The E2F1-binding domain was found
to be necessary for Xphb1 function in neural crest development. Gain- and
loss-of-function experiments reveal that Xphb1 represses E2F1 activity;
suppression of E2F1 through Xphb1 is required for twist, snail2 and foxD3
expression in the CNC. With the Xphb1 dependency of a subset of CNC specifiers
downstream of c-myc, we have identified a new branching point in the neural crest
gene regulatory network.

Blastomere fate and embryonic genome activation (EGA) during human embryonic
development are unsolved areas of high scientific and clinical interest.
Forty-nine blastomeres from 5- to 8-cell human embryos have been investigated
following an efficient single-cell cDNA amplification protocol to provide a
template for high-density microarray analysis. The previously described markers, 
characteristic of Inner Cell Mass (ICM) (n = 120), stemness (n = 190) and
Trophectoderm (TE) (n = 45), were analyzed, and a housekeeping pattern of 46
genes was established. All the human blastomeres from the 5- to 8-cell stage
embryo displayed a common gene expression pattern corresponding to ICM markers
(e.g., DDX3, FOXD3, LEFTY1, MYC, NANOG, POU5F1), stemness (e.g., POU5F1, DNMT3B, 
GABRB3, SOX2, ZFP42, TERT), and TE markers (e.g., GATA6, EOMES, CDX2, LHCGR). The
EGA profile was also investigated between the 5-6- and 8-cell stage embryos, and 
compared to the blastocyst stage. Known genes (n = 92) such as depleted maternal 
transcripts (e.g., CCNA1, CCNB1, DPPA2) and embryo-specific activation (e.g.,
POU5F1, CDH1, DPPA4), as well as novel genes, were confirmed. In summary, the
global single-cell cDNA amplification microarray analysis of the 5- to 8-cell
stage human embryos reveals that blastomere fate is not committed to ICM or TE.
Finally, new EGA features in human embryogenesis are presented.

Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) continue to draw
attention of researchers in the fields of basic science and medicine due to their
indispensible regenerative, reparative, angiogenic, anti-apoptotic, and
immunosuppressive properties, all of which collectively point out their enormous 
therapeutic potential. There is still, however, a need for further investigation 
of their characteristics to broaden their field of use and learn much more about 
how to control their fate and improve their therapeutic effectiveness. hBM-MSCs
were extensively characterized in terms of their growth characteristics, genetic 
stability, and differentiation capability to the mesodermal and ectodermal cell
lineages; a special emphasis was given to their phenotypic and ultrastructural
properties. Expression of embryonic stem cell markers Oct4, Rex-1, FoxD-3, Sox2, 
and Nanog was shown with real-time PCR. Transmission electron microscopy revealed
the ultrastructural characteristics of hBM-MSCs; they had pale, irregularly
shaped and large euchromatic nuclei, and two distinct areas in their cytoplasm:
an intensely stained inner zone rich in mitochondria and rough endoplasmic
reticulum (rER) with dilated cisternae and a relatively peripheral zone poor in
organelles. hBM-MSCs expressed adipogenic (adipophilin and PPAR<U+03B3>), myogenic
(desmin, myogenin, a-SMA), neurogenic (<U+03B3>-enolase, MAP2a,b, c-fos, nestin, NF-H,
NF-L, GFAP, ß3-tubulin), osteogenic (osteonectin, osteocalcin, osteopontin,
Runx-2, type I collagen), and chondrogenic (type II collagen, SOX9) markers
either at RNA or protein level even under basal conditions, without any
stimulation towards differentiation. The differentiation potential of hBM-MSCs to
adipogenic, osteogenic, and neurogenic lineages was shown by using the relevant
differentiation factors.

Modifications to the core histones are thought to contribute to ESC pluripotency 
by priming tissue-specific promoters and enhancers for later activation. However,
it is unclear how these marks are targeted in ESCs and maintained during
differentiation. Here, we show that the ESC factor Sox2 targets H3K4 methylation 
to monovalent and bivalent domains. In ESCs, Sox2 contributes to the formation of
a monovalent mark at an enhancer in the pro/pre-B cell-specific lambda5-VpreB1
locus. Binding of Foxd3 suppresses intergenic transcription of the enhancer and
surrounding sequences. In pro-B cells, enhancer activity is dependent on the Sox 
and Fox binding sites, and the enhancer is bound by Sox4, which is required for
efficient expression of lambda5. Our results lead us to propose a factor relay
model whereby ESC factors establish active epigenetic marks at tissue specific
elements before being replaced by cell type-specific factors as cells
differentiate.

Stabilization of ATF4 protein is required for the regulation of
epithelial-mesenchymal transition of the avian neural crest.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) permits neural crest cells to delaminate 
from the epithelial ectoderm and to migrate extensively in the embryonic
environment. In this study, we have identified ATF4, a basic-leucine-zipper
transcription factor, as one of the neural crest EMT regulators. Although ATF4
alone was not sufficient to drive the formation of migratory neural crest cells, 
ATF4 cooperated with Sox9 to induce neural crest EMT by controlling the
expression of cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion molecules. This
was likely, at least in part, by inducing the expression of Foxd3, which encodes 
another neural crest transcription factor. We also found that the ATF4 protein
level was strictly regulated by proteasomal degradation and p300-mediated
stabilization, allowing ATF4 protein to accumulate in the nuclei of neural crest 
cells undergoing EMT. Thus, our results emphasize the importance of the
regulation of protein stability in the neural crest EMT.

Interplay between Foxd3 and Mitf regulates cell fate plasticity in the zebrafish 
neural crest.

Pigment cells of the zebrafish, Danio rerio, offer an exceptionally tractable
system for studying the genetic and cellular bases of cell fate decisions. In the
zebrafish, neural crest cells generate three types of pigment cells during
embryogenesis: yellow xanthophores, iridescent iridophores and black
melanophores. In this study, we present evidence for a model whereby melanophores
and iridophores descend from a common precursor whose fate is regulated by an
interplay between the transcription factors Mitf and Foxd3. Loss of mitfa, a key 
regulator of melanophore development, resulted in supernumerary ectopic
iridophores while loss of foxd3, a mitfa repressor, resulted in fewer
iridophores. Double mutants showed a restoration of iridophores, suggesting that 
one of Foxd3's roles is to suppress mitfa to promote iridophore development.
Foxd3 co-localized with pnp4a, a novel marker of early iridophore development,
and was necessary for its expression. A considerable overlap was found between
iridoblast and melanoblast markers but not xanthoblast markers, which resolved as
cells began to differentiate. Cell lineage analyses using the photoconvertible
marker, EosFP, revealed that both melanophores and iridophores develop from a
mitfa+ precursor. Taken together, our data reveal a Foxd3/mitfa transcriptional
switch that governs whether a bi-potent pigment precursor will attain either an
iridophore or a melanophore fate.

Foxd3 is an essential Nodal-dependent regulator of zebrafish dorsal mesoderm
development.

Establishment of the embryonic mesoderm is dependent on integration of multiple
signaling and transcriptional inputs. We report that the transcriptional
regulator Foxd3 is essential for dorsal mesoderm formation in zebrafish, and that
this function is dependent on the Nodal pathway. Foxd3 gain-of-function results
in expanded dorsal mesodermal gene expression, including the Nodal-related gene
cyclops, and body axis dorsalization. Foxd3 knockdown embryos displayed reduced
expression of cyclops and mesodermal genes, axial defects similar to Nodal
pathway loss-of-function, and Nodal pathway activation rescued these phenotypes. 
In MZoep mutants inactive for Nodal signaling, Foxd3 did not rescue mesoderm
formation or axial development, indicating that the mesodermal function of Foxd3 
is dependent on an active downstream Nodal pathway. A previously identified foxd3
mutant, sym1, was described as a predicted null mutation with neural crest
defects, but no mesodermal or axial phenotypes. We find that Sym1 protein retains
activity and can induce strong mesodermal expansion and axial dorsalization. A
subset of sym1 homozygotes displays axial defects and reduced cyclops and
mesodermal gene expression, and penetrance of the mesodermal phenotypes is
enhanced by Foxd3 knockdown. Therefore, sym1 is a hypomorphic allele, and reduced
Foxd3 function results in a reduction of cyclops expression, and subsequent
mesodermal and axial defects. These results demonstrate that Foxd3 is an
essential upstream regulator of the Nodal pathway in zebrafish dorsal mesoderm
development and establish a broadly conserved role for Foxd3 in vertebrate
mesodermal development.

FOXD3 is a mutant B-RAF-regulated inhibitor of G(1)-S progression in melanoma
cells.

The forkhead box transcription factor FOXD3 is a stemness factor that prevents
the production of melanocyte progenitors from the developing neural crest;
however, its role in human cancers is not known. Transformation of melanocytes
gives rise to melanoma. In two thirds of melanomas, the serine/threonine kinase
B-RAF is mutated to a constitutively active form. Here, we show that FOXD3 levels
are upregulated following attenuation of B-RAF and mitogen-activated
protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) signaling in
mutant B-RAF harboring human melanoma cells. This effect was selective because
FOXD3 was not upregulated following MEK inhibition in wild-type B-RAF melanoma
cells and mutant B-RAF thyroid carcinoma cells. Ectopic FOXD3 expression potently
inhibited melanoma cell growth without altering mutant B-RAF activation of
ERK1/2. Inhibition of cell growth was due to a potent G(1) cell cycle arrest and 
was associated with p53-dependent upregulation of p21(Cip1). FOXD3-induced cell
cycle arrest was prevented by p53 depletion and, to a lesser extent, p21(Cip1)
depletion. These studies show that FOXD3 is suppressed by B-RAF, uncover a novel 
role and mechanism for FOXD3 as a negative cell cycle regulator, and have
implications for the repression of melanocytic lineage cells.

The transcription factor POU5f1/OCT4 controls pluripotency in mammalian ES cells,
but little is known about its functions in the early embryo. We used
time-resolved transcriptome analysis of zebrafish pou5f1 MZspg mutant embryos to 
identify genes regulated by Pou5f1. Comparison to mammalian systems defines
evolutionary conserved Pou5f1 targets. Time-series data reveal many Pou5f1
targets with delayed or advanced onset of expression. We identify two
Pou5f1-dependent mechanisms controlling developmental timing. First, several
Pou5f1 targets are transcriptional repressors, mediating repression of
differentiation genes in distinct embryonic compartments. We analyze her3 gene
regulation as example for a repressor in the neural anlagen. Second, the dynamics
of SoxB1 group gene expression and Pou5f1-dependent regulation of her3 and foxD3 
uncovers differential requirements for SoxB1 activity to control temporal
dynamics of activation, and spatial distribution of targets in the embryo. We
establish a mathematical model of the early Pou5f1 and SoxB1 gene network to
demonstrate regulatory characteristics important for developmental timing. The
temporospatial structure of the zebrafish Pou5f1 target networks may explain
aspects of the evolution of the mammalian stem cell networks.

platform for studying peripheral neuropathies.

BACKGROUND: The absence of a suitable cellular model is a major obstacle for the 
study of peripheral neuropathies. Human embryonic stem cells hold the potential
to be differentiated into peripheral neurons which makes them a suitable
candidate for this purpose. However, so far the potential of hESC to
differentiate into derivatives of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) was not
investigated enough and in particular, the few trials conducted resulted in low
yields of PNS neurons. Here we describe a novel hESC differentiation method to
produce enriched populations of PNS mature neurons. By plating 8 weeks hESC
derived neural progenitors (hESC-NPs) on laminin for two weeks in a defined
medium, we demonstrate that over 70% of the resulting neurons express PNS markers
and 30% of these cells are sensory neurons.
METHODS/FINDINGS: Our method shows that the hNPs express neuronal crest lineage
markers in a temporal manner, and by plating 8 weeks hESC-NPs into laminin coated
dishes these hNPs were promoted to differentiate and give rise to homogeneous PNS
neuronal populations, expressing several PNS lineage-specific markers.
Importantly, these cultures produced functional neurons with electrophysiological
activities typical of mature neurons. Moreover, supporting this physiological
capacity implantation of 8 weeks old hESC-NPs into the neural tube of chick
embryos also produced human neurons expressing specific PNS markers in vivo in
just a few days. Having the enriched PNS differentiation system in hand, we show 
for the first time in human PNS neurons the expression of IKAP/hELP1 protein,
where a splicing mutation on the gene encoding this protein causes the peripheral
neuropathy Familial Dysautonomia.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that this differentiation system to produce
high numbers of human PNS neurons will be useful for studying PNS related
neuropathies and for developing future drug screening applications for these
diseases.

In this study we demonstrated that neural rosettes derived from human ES cells
can give rise either to neural crest precursors, following expansion in presence 
of bFGF and EGF, or to dopaminergic precursors after exposure to ventralizing
factors Shh and FGF8. Both regionalised precursors are capable of extensive
proliferation and differentiation towards the corresponding terminally
differentiated cell types. In particular, peripheral neurons, cartilage, bone,
smooth muscle cells and also pigmented cells were obtained from neural crest
precursors while tyrosine hydroxylase and Nurr1 positive dopaminergic neurons
were derived from FGF8 and Shh primed rosette cells. Gene expression and
immunocytochemistry analyses confirmed the expression of dorsal and neural crest 
genes such as Sox10, Slug, p75, FoxD3, Pax7 in neural precursors from bFGF-EGF
exposed rosettes. By contrast, priming of rosettes with FGF8 and Shh induced the 
expression of dopaminergic markers Engrailed1, Pax2, Pitx3, floor plate marker
FoxA2 and radial glia markers Blbp and Glast, the latter in agreement with the
origin of dopaminergic precursors from floor plate radial glia. Moreover, in vivo
transplant of proliferating Shh/FGF8 primed precursors in parkinsonian rats
demonstrated engraftment and terminal dopaminergic differentiation. In
conclusion, we demonstrated the derivation of long-term self-renewing precursors 
of selected regional identity as potential cell reservoirs for cell therapy
applications, such as CNS degenerative diseases, or for the development of
toxicological tests.

Lipid rafts play an important role for maintenance of embryonic stem cell
self-renewal.

Lipid rafts are cholesterol-rich microdomains of cell membranes that have a
variety of roles in cellular processes including receptor-mediated signal
transduction. Lipid rafts also occur in embryonic stem (ES) cells, but their role
in ES cells is largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated the role of lipid
rafts in the maintenance of ES cell self-renewal. In the present study, we
observed that the presence of lipid rafts/caveolae. The results from sucrose
gradient fractionation showed that the expression of glycoprotein 130 (gp130) and
leukemia inhibitory factor receptor beta (LIFRbeta) was decreased by treatment
with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (Mbeta-CD) but, interestingly, was not affected by 
caveolin-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). In addition, LIF increased
phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and
Akt, and the expression level of c-Myc, which were attenuated by the pretreatment
with Mbeta-CD. However, caveolin-1 siRNA did not influence LIF-induced
phosphorylation of STAT3 and Akt, and expression of c-Myc. Treatment with
Mbeta-CD and caveolin-1 siRNA decreased expression levels of Oct4 protein and
Oct4, Sox2, FoxD3, and Rex1 mRNAs in normal culture conditions. Additionally,
Mbeta-CD and caveolin-1 siRNA decreased the expression levels of cyclin D1 and
cyclin E, and the proliferation index [(S + G2/M)/(G0/G1 + S + G2/M)] of ES
cells. We conclude that lipid raft/caveolae structures play important roles in
the self-renewal of ES cells.

Evidence for a dynamic spatiotemporal fate map and early fate restrictions of
premigratory avian neural crest.

Krispin S(1), Nitzan E, Kassem Y, Kalcheim C.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medical Neurobiology, IMRIC, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical 
School, Jerusalem, Israel.

Colonization of trunk neural crest derivatives in avians follows a ventral to
dorsal order beginning with sympathetic ganglia, Schwann cells, sensory ganglia
and finally melanocytes. Continuous crest emigration underlies this process,
which is accounted for by a progressive ventral to dorsal relocation of neural
tube progenitors prior to departure. This causes a gradual narrowing of FoxD3,
Sox9 and Snail2 expression domains in the dorsal tube that characterize the
neural progenitors of the crest and these genes are no longer transcribed by the 
time melanoblasts begin emigrating. Consistently, the final localization of crest
cells can be predicted from their relative ventrodorsal position within the
premigratory domain or by their time of delamination. Thus, a dynamic
spatiotemporal fate map of crest derivatives exists in the dorsal tube at flank
levels of the axis with its midline region acting as a sink for the ordered
ingression and departure of progenitors. Furthermore, discrete lineage analysis
of the dorsal midline at progressive stages generated progeny in single rather
than multiple derivatives, revealing early fate restrictions. Compatible with
this notion, when early emigrating ;neural' progenitors were diverted into the
lateral ;melanocytic' pathway, they still adopted neural traits, suggesting that 
initial fate acquisition is independent of the migratory environment and that the
potential of crest cells prior to emigration is limited.

A number of transcription factors have been identified as important in guiding
normal Schwann cell development. This study used immunohistochemistry on tissue
arrays to assess the expression of some of these transcription factors (Sox5,
Sox9, Sox10, AP-2a, Pax7, and FoxD3) on 76 schwannomas, 105 neurofibromas, and 34
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). Sox9 and Sox10 were found to
be widely expressed in all tumor types. FoxD3 reactivity was stronger and more
frequently found in schwannomas and MPNSTs than neurofibromas. AP-2a was positive
in 31% to 49% of all tumors, but strong reactivity was limited to MPNSTs and
schwannomas. Pax7 and Sox5 expression was restricted to subsets of MPNSTs.
Statistical analysis showed significant differences between the 3 tumor types in 
the expression of these markers. No differences were found in the analyzed tumor 
subgroups, including schwannomas of different sites, schwannomas with or without 
NF2 association, neurofibromas of different types, or sporadic versus
NF1-associated MPNSTs. These results suggest that the transcription factors that 
guide normal Schwann cell development also play a role in the biology of
neoplastic cells with Schwannian differentiation. FoxD3, AP-2a, Pax7, and Sox5
are upregulated in MPNSTs compared with neurofibromas and may be markers of
malignant transformation. Screening the expression of FoxD3, Sox9, and Sox10 on
23 cases of other spindle-cell proliferations that may be considered in the
differential diagnosis of MPNST, including synovial sarcoma and spindle cell
melanoma, suggests that these 3 are helpful markers of Schwannian differentiation
in the context of diagnosing MPNSTs.

Comment in
    Genes Dev. 2009 Dec 15;23(24):2793-8.

We reported previously that well-characterized enhancers but not promoters for
typical tissue-specific genes, including the classic Alb1 gene, contain
unmethylated CpG dinucleotides and evidence of pioneer factor interactions in
embryonic stem (ES) cells. These properties, which are distinct from the bivalent
histone modification domains that characterize the promoters of genes involved in
developmental decisions, raise the possibility that genes expressed only in
differentiated cells may need to be marked at the pluripotent stage. Here, we
demonstrate that the forkhead family member FoxD3 is essential for the
unmethylated mark observed at the Alb1 enhancer in ES cells, with FoxA1 replacing
FoxD3 following differentiation into endoderm. Up-regulation of FoxD3 and loss of
CpG methylation at the Alb1 enhancer accompanied the reprogramming of mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Studies
of two genes expressed in specific hematopoietic lineages revealed that the
establishment of enhancer marks in ES cells and iPS cells can be regulated both
positively and negatively. Furthermore, the absence of a pre-established mark
consistently resulted in resistance to transcriptional activation in the
repressive chromatin environment that characterizes differentiated cells. These
results support the hypothesis that pluripotency and successful reprogramming may
be critically dependent on the marking of enhancers for many or all
tissue-specific genes.

Early stages in the development of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have not
been explored mainly due to the inability to study normal B-cells en route to
transformation. In order to determine such early events of leukemogenesis, we
have used a well established mouse model for CLL. Over-expression of human TCL1, 
a known CLL oncogene in murine B-cells leads to the development of mature
CD19+/CD5+/IgM+ clonal leukemia with a disease phenotype similar to that seen in 
human CLL. Herein, we review our recent study using this TCL1-driven mouse model 
for CLL and corresponding human CLL samples in a cross-species epigenomics
approach to address the timing and relevance of epigenetic events occurring
during leukemogenesis. We demonstrated that the mouse model recapitulates the
epigenetic events that have been reported for human CLL, affirming the power and 
validity of this mouse model to study early epigenetic events in cancer
progression. Epigenetic alterations are detected as early as three months after
birth, far before disease manifests at about 11 months of age. These mice undergo
NFkappaB repressor complex mediated inactivation of the transcription factor
Foxd3, whose targets become aberrantly methylated and silenced in mouse and human
CLL. Overall, our data suggest the accumulated epigenetic alterations during CLL 
pathogenesis as a consequence of gene silencing through TCL1 and NFkappaB
repressor complex, suggesting the relevance for NFkappaB as a therapeutic target 
in CLL.

Cellular nucleic acid binding protein (CNBP) is a strikingly conserved
zinc-finger nucleic acid chaperone required for forebrain development. Its
depletion causes forebrain truncation mainly as a consequence of a reduction in
size of craniofacial structures and neural crest derivatives. The CNBP expression
pattern is complex and highly dynamic, but little is known of the underlying
mechanisms regulating its spatiotemporal pattern. CNBP expression is highly
conserved between all vertebrates characterized. In this study we have combined
comparative sequence analysis and in vivo testing of DNA fragments in zebrafish
to identify evolutionarily constrained regulatory motifs that likely control
expression of the cnbp gene in embryos. We found a novel exon sequence located 5'
upstream of the Exon1-sequence reported in most databases, and two transcription 
start sites that generate two primary-transcripts that differ in their 5'UTRs and
expression profile during zebrafish embryonic development. Furthermore, we found 
a region inside the intron1 sequence that controls the cnbp
developmental-specific transcriptional activation. Conserved binding sites for
neural crest transcription factors were identified in this region. Mutagenesis
analysis of the regulatory region revealed that Pax6/FoxD3 binding sites are
required for proper zygotic cnbp expression. This is the first study that
identifies, in vivo, cis-regulatory sequences inside intron sequences and typical
neural crest transcription factors involved in cnbp spatiotemporal specific
transcriptional control during vertebrate embryonic development.

Embryonic stem (ES) cells maintain pluripotency by self-renewal. Several
homeoproteins, including Oct3/4 and Nanog, are known to be key factors in
maintaining the self-renewal capacity of ES cells. However, other genes required 
for the mechanisms underlying this process are still unclear. Here we report the 
identification by in silico analysis of a homeobox-containing gene, CrxOS, that
is specifically expressed in murine ES cells and is essential for their
self-renewal. ES cells mainly express the short isoform of endogenous CrxOS.
Using a polyoma-based episomal expression system, we demonstrate that
overexpression of the CrxOS short isoform is sufficient for maintaining the
undifferentiated morphology of ES cells and stimulating their proliferation.
Finally, using RNA interference, we show that CrxOS is essential for the
self-renewal of ES cells, and provisionally identify foxD3 as a downstream target
gene of CrxOS. To our knowledge, ours is the first delineation of the
physiological role of CrxOS in ES cells.

The habenulae are part of an evolutionary conserved conduction system that
connects the limbic forebrain areas with midbrain structures and is implicated in
important functions such as feeding, mating, avoidance learning, and hormonal
response to stress. Very early during zebrafish neurogenesis the parapineal organ
migrates near to one habenula, commonly the left, inducing wide left-right
habenular asymmetries in gene expression and connectivity. It was posited that
this initial symmetry-breaking event determines the development of lateralized
brain functions and early differences in epithalamic left-right asymmetry give
rise to individual variation in coping styles and personality. We tested these
two hypotheses by sorting zebrafish with left or right parapineal at birth using 
a foxD3:GFP marker and by measuring visual and motor laterality and three
personality dimensions as they become adults. Significant differences between
fish with opposite parapineal position were found in all laterality tests while
the influence of asymmetry of the habenulae on personality was more complex. Fish
with atypical right parapineal position, tended to be bolder when inspecting a
predator, spent less time in the peripheral portion of an open field and covered 
a shorter distance when released in the dark. Activity in the open field was not 
associated to anatomical asymmetry but correlated with laterality of predator
inspection that in turn was influenced by parapineal position. One personality
dimension, sociality, appeared uncorrelated to both anatomical and functional
asymmetries and was instead influenced by the sex of the fish, thus suggesting
that other factors, i.e. hormonal, may be implicated in its development.

Generalized vitiligo is the most common pigmentation disorder, the result of
autoimmune loss of melanocytes from the skin and hair, with a high frequency of
other autoimmune diseases in vitiligo patients and their relatives. We previously
reported the linkage signals on chromosomes 1, 7, and 17 in Caucasian families
with generalized vitiligo and associated autoimmune diseases and identified the
risk loci of chromosomes 17 and 1 as NLRP1 (NALP1) and FOXD3, respectively. Here,
we describe fine-scale genetic association analyses in two independent series of 
Caucasian multiplex families, refining localization of the chromosome 7 locus and
a locus on chromosome 9. Three susceptibility signals, represented by
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs6960920 in 7p13, rs734930 in 7q11, and
rs4744411 in 9q22, were significantly associated with vitiligo and other
autoimmune diseases. We also detected significant three-way interaction effects
of chromosome 7 SNP rs6960920, chromosome 9 SNP rs4744411, and NLRP1 SNP
rs6502867 on both the vitiligo phenotype and an expanded autoimmune disease
phenotype, and significant three-way interaction effects of both chromosome 7
SNPs and NLRP1 SNP rs6502867 on the vitiligo phenotype. These support the
validity of the chromosomes 7 and 9 linkage/association signals and underscore
the utility of gene-gene interaction analysis in characterizing the genetic
effects of candidate association signals.

Epigenetic alterations, including gain or loss of DNA methylation, are a hallmark
of nearly every malignancy. Changes in DNA methylation can impact expression of
cancer-related genes including apoptosis regulators and tumor suppressors.
Because such epigenetic changes are reversible, they are being aggressively
investigated as potential therapeutic targets. Here we use the Emu-TCL1
transgenic mouse model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) to determine the
timing and patterns of aberrant DNA methylation, and to investigate the
mechanisms that lead to aberrant DNA methylation. We show that CLL cells from
Emu-TCL1 mice at various stages recapitulate epigenetic alterations seen in human
CLL. Aberrant methylation of promoter sequences is observed as early as 3 months 
of age in these animals, well before disease onset. Abnormally methylated
promoter regions include binding sites for the transcription factor FOXD3. We
show that loss of Foxd3 expression due to an NF-kappaB p50/p50:HDAC1 repressor
complex occurs in TCL1-positive B cells before methylation. Therefore, specific
transcriptional repression is an early event leading to epigenetic silencing of
target genes in murine and human CLL. These results provide strong rationale for 
the development of strategies to target NF-kappaB components in CLL and
potentially other B-cell malignancies.

This work reports the characterization and functional analysis of disrupted in
schizophrenia 1 (disc1), a well-documented schizophrenia-susceptibility gene, in 
zebrafish cranial neural crest (CNC). Our data demonstrated that disc1 was
expressed in zebrafish CNC cells. Loss of Disc1 resulted in persistent CNC cell
medial migration, dorsal to the developing neural epithelium, and hindered
migration away from the region dorsal to the neural rod. General CNC cell
motility was not affected by Disc1 knockdown, however, as the speed of CNC cells 
was indistinguishable from that of wild-type counterparts. We determined that the
failure of CNC cells to migrate away from the neural rod correlated with the
enhanced expression of two transcription factors, foxd3 and sox10. These
transcription factors have many functions in CNC cells, including the maintenance
of precursor pools, timing of migration onset, and the induction of cell
differentiation. Our work, in conjunction with previous studies, suggests that
the perpetuation of expression of these factors affects several aspects of CNC
cell development, leading to a loss of craniofacial cartilage and an expansion of
peripheral cranial glia. Based on our data, we propose a model in which Disc1
functions in the transcriptional repression of foxd3 and sox10, thus mediating
CNC cell migration and differentiation.

It is known that bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4) has a diverse effect on
ESCs. However, its precise mechanism in mouse ESCs is not fully understood. We
evaluated the effect of BMP-4 on ESC proliferation and its related signal
cascades in this study. BMP-4 significantly increased the level of
[(3)H]-thymidine incorporation in time- (> or =8 hours) and dose- (> or =10
ng/ml) dependent manners. Additionally, BMP-4 increased cyclin D1 and decreased
p27(kip1) expression values in a time-dependent manner. The increases in
BMP-4-induced [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation and cyclin D1 expression were
inhibited by the BMP-4 receptor antagonist noggin. BMP-4 increased Wnt1
expression. Wnt1 expression was attenuated by Smad4 small interfering RNA
(siRNA), and BMP-4-induced cyclin D1 expression was inhibited by Smad4 and Wnt1
siRNAs. BMP-4 also activated beta-catenin, which was blocked by Smad4 and Wnt1
siRNAs. In addition, BMP-4 induced Akt phosphorylation. BMP-4-induced
beta-catenin activation and cyclin D1 expression were attenuated by phosphatidyl 
inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) siRNA and Akt inhibitor. Additionally, downregulation of
Smad4, Wnt1, and PI3K expression by siRNA decreased the levels of pluripotency
marker mRNAs of ESCs, including Oct4, Sox2, and FoxD3. Our results suggested that
BMP-4-induced [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation was significantly attenuated by
Smad4, Wnt1, and PI3K knockdown. In conclusion, BMP-4 contributed to the
maintenance of cell proliferation and the pluripotent state by Smad, PI3K/Akt,
and Wnt1/beta-catenin in mouse ESCs.

Foxd3 controls melanophore specification in the zebrafish neural crest by
regulation of Mitf.

Curran K(1), Raible DW, Lister JA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-7420, USA.

We describe a mechanistic model whereby Foxd3, a forkhead transcription factor,
prevents neural crest-derived precursors from acquiring a melanophore fate. Foxd3
regulates this fate choice by repressing the mitfa promoter in a subset of neural
crest cells. mitfa is only expressed in a Foxd3-negative subset of neural crest
cells, and foxd3 mutants show an increase in the spatial domain of mitfa
expression, thereby suggesting that Foxd3 limits the mitfa domain. Furthermore,
foxd3:gfp transgenic zebrafish reveal foxd3 expression in xanthophore precursors 
and iridophores, but not in terminally differentiated melanophores. Luciferase
experiments and embryo mRNA injections indicate Foxd3 acts directly on the mitfa 
promoter to negatively regulate mitfa expression. Taken together, our data
suggests the presence of Foxd3 in a subset of precursors leads to mitfa
repression and suppression of melanophore fate. MITF, the human mitfa ortholog,
has recently been described as an oncogene and implicated in various forms of
melanoma. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate mitfa and melanophore
development could prove informative in the treatment and prevention of these
human diseases.

Lmx1b is essential for survival of periocular mesenchymal cells and influences
Fgf-mediated retinal patterning in zebrafish.

McMahon C(1), Gestri G, Wilson SW, Link BA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cell Biology, Neurobiology, and Anatomy, Medical College of
Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA.

To gain insight into the mechanisms of Lmx1b function during ocular
morphogenesis, we have studied the roles of lmx1b.1 and lmx1b.2 during zebrafish 
eye development. In situ hybridization and characterization of transgenic lines
in which GFP is expressed under lmx1b.1 regulatory sequence show that these genes
are expressed in periocular tissues and in a pattern conserved with other
vertebrates. Anti-sense morpholinos against lmx1b.1 and lmx1b.2 result in
defective migration of periocular mesenchymal cells around the eye and lead to
apoptosis of these cells. These defects in the periocular mesenchyme are
correlated with a failure in fusion of the choroid fissure or in some instances, 
more severe ventral optic cup morphogenesis phenotypes. Indeed, by blocking the
death of the periocular mesenchyme in Lmx1b morphants, optic vesicle
morphogenesis is largely restored. Within the retina of lmx1b morphants, Fgf
activity is transiently up-regulated and these morphants show defective
naso-temporal patterning. Epistasis experiments indicate that the increase in Fgf
activity is partially responsible for the ocular anomalies caused by loss of
Lmx1b function. Overall, we propose zebrafish lmx1b.1 and lmx1b.2 promote the
survival of periocular mesenchymal cells that influence multiple signaling events
required for proper ocular development.

Genetic ablation of neural crest cell diversification.

Arduini BL(1), Bosse KM, Henion PD.

Author information: 
(1)Center for Molecular Neurobiology, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, 
USA.

The neural crest generates multiple cell types during embryogenesis but the
mechanisms regulating neural crest cell diversification are incompletely
understood. Previous studies using mutant zebrafish indicated that foxd3 and
tfap2a function early and differentially in the development of neural crest
sublineages. Here, we show that the simultaneous loss of foxd3 and tfap2a
function in zebrafish foxd3(zdf10);tfap2a(low) double mutant embryos globally
prevents the specification of developmentally distinct neural crest sublineages. 
By contrast, neural crest induction occurs independently of foxd3 and tfap2a
function. We show that the failure of neural crest cell diversification in double
mutants is accompanied by the absence of neural crest sox10 and sox9a/b gene
expression, and that forced expression of sox10 and sox9a/b differentially
rescues neural crest sublineage specification and derivative differentiation.
These results demonstrate the functional necessity for foxd3 and tfap2a for
neural crest sublineage specification and that this requirement is mediated by
the synergistic regulation of the expression of SoxE family genes. Our results
identify a genetic regulatory pathway functionally discrete from the process of
neural crest induction that is required for the initiation of neural crest cell
diversification during embryonic development.

FOXD3 regulates the lineage switch between neural crest-derived glial cells and
pigment cells by repressing MITF through a non-canonical mechanism.

Author information: 
(1)Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of California Davis, Davis, CA

The first neural crest cells to emigrate from the neural tube are specified as
neurons and glial cells and are subsequently followed by melanocytes of the skin.
We wished to understand how this fate switch is controlled. The transcriptional
repressor FOXD3 is expressed exclusively in the neural/glial precursors and MITF 
is expressed only in melanoblasts. Moreover, FOXD3 represses melanogenesis. Here 
we show that avian MITF expression begins very early during melanoblast migration
and that loss of MITF in melanoblasts causes them to transdifferentiate to a
glial phenotype. Ectopic expression of FOXD3 represses MITF in cultured neural
crest cells and in B16-F10 melanoma cells. We also show that FOXD3 does not bind 
directly to the MITF promoter, but instead interacts with the transcriptional
activator PAX3 to prevent the binding of PAX3 to the MITF promoter.
Overexpression of PAX3 is sufficient to rescue MITF expression from
FOXD3-mediated repression. We conclude that FOXD3 controls the lineage choice
between neural/glial and pigment cells by repressing MITF during the early phase 
of neural crest migration.

development.

BACKGROUND: FGF signaling has multiple roles in regulating processes in animal
development, including the specification and patterning of the mesoderm. In
addition, FGF signaling supports self renewal of human embryonic stem cells and
is required for differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells into a number of
lineages.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Given the importance of FGF signaling in
regulating development and stem cell behaviour, we aimed to identify the
transcriptional targets of FGF signalling during early development in the
vertebrate model Xenopus laevis. We analysed the effects on gene expression in
embryos in which FGF signaling was inhibited by dominant negative FGF receptors. 
67 genes positively regulated by FGF signaling and 16 genes negatively regulated 
by FGF signaling were identified. FGF target genes are expressed in distinct
waves during the late blastula to early gastrula phase. Many of these genes are
expressed in the early mesoderm and dorsal ectoderm. A widespread requirement for
FGF in regulating genes expressed in the Spemann organizer is revealed. The FGF
targets MKP1 and DUSP5 are shown to be negative regulators of FGF signaling in
early Xenopus tissues. FoxD3 and Lin28, which are involved in regulating
pluripotency in ES cells are shown to be down regulated when FGF signaling is
blocked.
CONCLUSIONS: We have undertaken a detailed analysis of FGF target genes which has
generated a robust, well validated data set. We have found a widespread role for 
FGF signaling in regulating the expression of genes mediating the function of the
Spemann organizer. In addition, we have found that the FGF targets MKP1 and DUSP5
are likely to contribute to the complex feedback loops involved in modulating
responses to FGF signaling. We also find a link between FGF signaling and the
expression of known regulators of pluripotency.

Kit and foxd3 genetically interact to regulate melanophore survival in zebrafish.

Cooper CD(1), Linbo TH, Raible DW.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biological Structure, University of Washington, Seattle,
Washington, USA. cdcooper@vancouver.wsu.edu

We have investigated the role of foxd3 activity in conjunction with signaling by 
the kit tyrosine kinase receptor in zebrafish black pigment cell (melanophore)
development. As loss-of-function of these molecules individually has distinct
effects on melanophore number, we have examined the phenotype of double mutants. 
Individuals with a null mutation in kit have fewer melanophores than wild-type,
with cells lost through death. When kit mutants are injected with foxd3 antisense
morpholino oligonucleotides or crossed with a foxd3 zebrafish mutant, they have
more melanophores than their uninjected or foxd3+ counterparts. Examination of
foxd3 loss-of-function in two additional kit mutants that differentially alter
kit-dependent migration and survival indicates a change in melanophore number in 
survival mutants only. Consistently, TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated deoxyuridinetriphosphate nick end-labeling) analysis
confirms a partial rescue of melanophores from cell death. Ectopic expression of 
foxd3 indicates that foxd3 promotes early melanophore death only when kit is
inactive. Taken together, these data suggest a kit-dependent role for foxd3 in
the regulation of melanophore survival.

The differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into neurons and glial cells
represents a promising cell-based therapy for neurodegenerative diseases. Because
the rhesus macaque is physiologically and phylogenetically similar to humans, it 
is a clinically relevant animal model for ESC research. In this study, the
pluripotency and neural differentiation potential of a rhesus monkey ESC line
(ORMES6) was investigated. ORMES6 was derived from an in vitro produced
blastocyst, which is the same way human ESCs have been derived. ORMES6 stably
expressed the embryonic transcription factors POU5F1 (Oct4), Sox2 and NANOG.
Stage-specific embryonic antigen 4 (SSEA 4) and the glycoproteins TRA-1-60 and
TRA-1-81 were also expressed. The embryoid bodies (EBs) formed from ORMES6 ESCs
spontaneously gave rise to cells of three germ layers. After exposure to basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) for 14-16 days, columnar rosette cells formed in 
the EB outgrowths. Sox2, microtubule-associated protein (MAP2), beta-tublinIII
and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) genes and Nestin, FoxD3, Pax6 and
beta-tublinIII antigens were expressed in the rosette cells. Oct4 and NANOG
expression were remarkably down-regulated in these cells. After removal of bFGF
from the medium, the rosette cells differentiated along neural lineages. The
differentiated cells expressed MAP2, beta-tublinIII, Neuro D and GFAP genes. Most
differentiated cells expressed early neuron-specific antigen beta-tublinIII
(73+/-4.7%) and some expressed intermediate neuron antigen MAP2 (18+/-7.2%).
However, some differentiated cells expressed the glial cell antigens A2B5
(7.17%+/-1.2%), GFAP (4.93+/-1.9%), S100 (7+/-3.5%) and O4 (0.27+/-0.2%). The
rosette cells were transplanted into the striatum of immune-deficient NIHIII
mice. The cells persisted for approximately 2 weeks and expressed Ki67, NeuN,
MAP2 and GFAP. These results demonstrate that the rhesus monkey ESC line ORMES6
retains the pluripotent characteristics of ESCs and can be efficiently induced to
differentiate along neural lineages.

Neural crest ontogeny during secondary neurulation: a gene expression pattern
study in the chick embryo.

In the prospective lumbo-sacral region of the chick embryo, neurulation is
achieved by cavitation of the medullary cord, a process called secondary
neurulation. Neural crest cells (NCC) are generated in this region and they give 
rise to the same types of derivatives as in more rostral parts of the trunk where
neurulation occurs by dorsal fusion of the neural plate borders (primary
neurulation). However, no molecular data were available concerning the different 
steps of their ontogeny. We thus performed a detailed expression study of
molecular players likely to participate in the generation of secondary NCC in
chick embryos between Hamburger and Hamilton stages 18-20 (HH18-20) at the level 
of somites 30 to 43. We found that specification of secondary NCC involves, as in
primary neurulation, the activity of several transcription factors such as Pax3, 
Pax7, Snail2, FoxD3 and Sox9, which are all expressed in the dorsal secondary
neural tube as soon as full cavitation is achieved. Moreover, once specification 
has occurred, emigration of NCC from the dorsal neuroepithelium starts facing
early dissociating somites and involves a series of changes in cell shape and
adhesion, as well as interactions with the extracellular matrix. Furthermore,
Bmp4 and Wnt1 expression precedes the detection of migratory secondary NCC and is
coincident with maturation of adjacent somites. Altogether, this first study of
molecular aspects of secondary NCC ontogeny has revealed that the mechanisms of
neural crest generation occurring along the trunk region of the chick embryo are 
generally conserved and independent of the type of neurulation involved.

The role of promoter CpG methylation in the epigenetic control of stem cell
related genes during differentiation.

Differentiation and malignant transformation of stem cells are regulated by
epigenetic mechanisms. We analyzed promoter methylation and expression of the
stem cell determining genes Brachyury, DPPA5, FGF4, FOXD3, LIN28, NESTIN and
ZFP42 depending on the differentiation state in human mesenchymal stem cells
(MSC), human embryonal carcinoma cells (ECC) and somatic tumor cells.
Differentiation of MSC into osteoblasts and adipocytes was accompanied with a
loss of expression of the Brachyury gene and downregulation of LIN28.
Inactivation of Brachyury was associated with progressive methylation of its CpG 
island promoter. In ECC promoter methylation of stem cell markers was more
frequent in the differentiated subgroup (71%) compared to undifferentiated ECC
(29%) and this was associated with downregulation of Brachyury, DPPA5, FGF4,
FOXD3, LIN28 and ZFP42. DPPA5 was methylated and NESTIN was unmethylated in most 
tumor cells. In somatic tumor cells, methylation of stem cell markers (Brachyury,
DPPA5, FGF4, FOXD3, LIN28 and ZFP42) was frequently observed (85%). Treatment of 
cell lines with an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase reactivated the expression 
of DPPA5, FGF4, FOXD3, LIN28 and ZFP42, indicating that aberrant promoter
methylation is a crucial event that results in their silencing. Our results
suggest that epigenetic inactivation of stem cell associated genes is mediated by
promoter methylation and that this may represent a fundamental mechanism during
normal differentiation processes.

Bisphenol A disrupts Notch signaling by inhibiting gamma-secretase activity and
causes eye dysplasia of Xenopus laevis.

Bisphenol A (BPA) is being recognized as an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC). 
Recently, several reports indicated that BPA affects the central nervous system
(CNS) during embryonic development. However, the molecular mechanism of BPA in
the CNS is not well known. Here, we show that BPA affected Notch signaling by
inhibiting the activity of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) cleavage-related
enzyme, gamma-secretase (gamma-secretase), at the neurula stage of the Xenopus
laevis. BPA caused various morphologic aberrations including scoliosis, eye
dysplasia, and loss of pigments in the X. laevis tadpole. These abnormalities
were seen whenever BPA was used at the neurula stage. In addition, the expression
levels of several marker mRNAs at the neurula stage were investigated by RT-PCR, 
and we found that the mRNAs expression of ectodermal marker, Pax6, CNS marker,
Sox2, and neural crest marker, FoxD3, were decreased by treatment with BPA. These
genes contribute to the neural differentiation at the neurula stage, and also the
downstream factors of Notch signaling. Injection of NICD but not a Notch ligand, 
delta 1, rescued the abnormalities caused by BPA. We subsequently assayed the
inhibition of the activities of NICD cleavage-related enzymes, tumor necrosis
factor alpha converting enzyme, and gamma-secretase, by BPA and found that BPA
inhibited the gamma-secretase activity. Furthermore, we expressed presenilin, a
main component of gamma-secretase, in Escherichia coli and found the direct
binding of BPA with presenilin. These results suggest that BPA affected the
neural differentiation by inhibiting gamma-secretase activity, leading to
neurodevelopmental abnormalities.

An Fgf8-dependent bistable cell migratory event establishes CNS asymmetry.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, UCL, Gower Street, London
WC1E6BT, UK.

Neuroanatomical and functional asymmetries are universal features of the
vertebrate CNS, but how asymmetry is generated is unknown. Here we show that
zebrafish fgf8 mutants do not elaborate forebrain asymmetries, demonstrated by
the failure of the parapineal nucleus to migrate from its initial midline
position to the left side of the brain. Local provision of Fgf8 restores the
asymmetric migration of parapineal cells, usually to the left, irrespective of
the location of the Fgf8 source. This laterality bias is due to left-sided Nodal 
signaling and when the bias in Nodal signaling is removed, parapineal cells
migrate toward the source of Fgf8 protein. This study presents a mechanism for
breaking neuroanatomical symmetry through Fgf8-dependent regulation of bistable
left- or right-sided migration of the parapineal. The combined action of Fgf and 
Nodal signals ensures the establishment of neuroanatomical asymmetries with
consistent laterality.

The Olig3 gene encodes a bHLH factor that is expressed in the ventricular zone of
the dorsal alar plate of the hindbrain. We found that the Olig3(+) progenitor
domain encompassed subdomains that co-expressed Math1, Ngn1, Mash1 and Ptf1a.
Olig3(+) cells give rise to neuronal types in the dorsal alar plate that we
denote as class A neurons. We used genetic lineage tracing to demonstrate that
class A neurons contribute to the nucleus of the solitary tract and to
precerebellar nuclei. The fate of class A neurons was not correctly determined in
Olig3 mutant mice. As a consequence, the nucleus of the solitary tract did not
form, and precerebellar nuclei, such as the inferior olivary nucleus, were absent
or small. At the expense of class A neurons, ectopic Lbx1(+) neurons appeared in 
the alar plate in Olig3 mutant mice. By contrast, electroporation of an Olig3
expression vector in the chick hindbrain suppressed the emergence of Lbx1(+)
neurons. Climbing fiber neurons of the inferior olivary nucleus express Foxd3 and
require Olig3 as well as Ptf1a for the determination of their fate. We observed
that electroporation of Olig3 and Ptf1a expression vectors, but not either alone,
induced Foxd3. We therefore propose that Olig3 can cooperate with Ptf1a to
determine the fate of climbing fiber neurons of the inferior olivary nucleus.

The making of a melanocyte: the specification of melanoblasts from the neural
crest.

Thomas AJ(1), Erickson CA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of California at
Davis, Davis, CA, USA. ajthomas@ucdavis.edu

Melanocytes differentiate from the neural crest (NC), which is a transient
population of cells that delaminates from the neural tube and migrates
extensively throughout the embryo during vertebrate development. Melanoblast
specification from NC precursors is a progressive process during which initially 
pluripotent cells become restricted to the melanogenic lineage and adopt the gene
expression profile and morphology of melanocytes. This specification process is
governed primarily by Wnt and BMP signaling molecules, although other signaling
pathways, such as those activated by Kit and Endothelin 3, can also stimulate
melanogenesis. The transcriptional repressor FoxD3 occupies a central role in
melanocyte fate determination by repressing melanogenesis in premigratory NC
cells and in other NC lineages.

YY1 and FoxD3 regulate antiretroviral zinc finger protein OTK18 promoter
activation induced by HIV-1 infection.

Neurovirology and Neurodegenerative Disorders, University of Nebraska Medical
Center, Omaha, NE 68198-5880, USA.

OTK18 is a C2H2 type zinc finger protein involved in the regulation of HIV-1
replication in human mononuclear phagocytes. Previously, we reported OTK18
expression in brain perivascular macrophages but not in microglia in HIV
encephalitis brain. We have cloned the OTK18 promoter region proximal to the
transcriptional start site and determined the region responsible (-884/+1) for
the basal transcriptional activity in a microglia cell line. Sequential deletion 
mutation analyses reveal three important response elements: Yingyang-1 (YY1;
-805/-777), an HIV-1 response element for promoter activation; FoxD3 (-743/-725),
a negative regulatory element; and Ets response element (-725/-707), a basal
transcriptional activity response element. HIV-1 infection-induced upregulation
of YY1 and c-Ets-1 protein, binding to the promoter region as determined by
immunoblotting and chromatin immunoprecipitation and polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) assays, and induction of YY1 was also observed in virus-infected
monocyte-derived macrophages. Silencing of FoxD3 and YY1 in the cell line by
small interfering RNA duplexes specific to these molecules significantly up- and 
downregulated basal OTK18 promoter activity in FoxD3 and YY1 response
element-dependent manners, respectively. On the other hand, infection of primary 
cultured human microglia significantly reduced YY1 expression and induced FoxD3
as determined by immunoblotting and reverse transcription real-time PCR. These
data suggest that HIV-1 induces OTK18 expression through a YY1-mediated manner in
human macrophages, although its gene expression is suppressed by FoxD3
upregulation and YY1 downregulation in human microglia. This mechanism may
explain the perivascular macrophage-specific expression of OTK18 in HIV
encephalitis brains.

The endoderm is a multipotent progenitor cell population in the embryo that gives
rise to the liver, pancreas, and other cell types and provides paradigms for
understanding cell-type specification. Studies of isolated embryo tissue cells
and genetic approaches in vivo have defined fibroblast growth
factor/mitogen-activated protein kinase (FGF/MAPK) and bone morphogenetic protein
(BMP) signaling pathways that induce liver and pancreatic fates in the endoderm. 
In undifferentiated endoderm cells, the FoxA and GATA transcription factors are
among the first to engage silent genes, helping to endow competence for cell-type
specification. FoxA proteins can bind their target sites in highly compacted
chromatin and open up the local region for other factors to bind; hence, they
have been termed "pioneer factors." We recently found that FoxA proteins remain
bound to chromatin in mitosis, as an epigenetic mark. In embryonic stem cells,
which lack FoxA, FoxA target sites can be occupied by FoxD3, which in turn helps 
to maintain a local demethylation of chromatin. By these means, a cascade of Fox 
factors helps to endow progenitor cells with the competence to activate genes in 
response to tissue-inductive signals. Understanding such epigenetic mechanisms
for transcriptional competence coupled with knowledge of the relevant signals for
cell-type specification should greatly facilitate efforts to predictably
differentiate stem cells to liver and pancreatic fates.

BACKGROUND: A major challenge lies in understanding the complexities of gene
regulation. Mutation of the transcription factor SOX10 is associated with several
human diseases. The disease phenotypes reflect the function of SOX10 in diverse
tissues including the neural crest, central nervous system and otic vesicle. As
expected, the SOX10 expression pattern is complex and highly dynamic, but little 
is known of the underlying mechanisms regulating its spatiotemporal pattern.
SOX10 expression is highly conserved between all vertebrates characterised.
RESULTS: We have combined in vivo testing of DNA fragments in zebrafish and
computational comparative genomics to identify the first regulatory regions of
the zebrafish sox10 gene. Both approaches converged on the 3' end of the
conserved 1st intron as being critical for spatial patterning of sox10 in the
embryo. Importantly, we have defined a minimal region crucial for this function. 
We show that this region contains numerous binding sites for transcription
factors known to be essential in early neural crest induction, including Tcf/Lef,
Sox and FoxD3. We show that the identity and relative position of these binding
sites are conserved between zebrafish and mammals. A further region, partially
required for oligodendrocyte expression, lies in the 5' region of the same intron
and contains a putative CSL binding site, consistent with a role for Notch
signalling in sox10 regulation. Furthermore, we show that beta-catenin, Notch
signalling and Sox9 can induce ectopic sox10 expression in early embryos,
consistent with regulatory roles predicted from our transgenic and computational 
results.
CONCLUSION: We have thus identified two major sites of sox10 regulation in
vertebrates and provided evidence supporting a role for at least three factors in
driving sox10 expression in neural crest, otic epithelium and oligodendrocyte
domains.

Gene duplication, co-option and recruitment during the origin of the vertebrate
brain from the invertebrate chordate brain.

The brain of the basal chordate amphioxus has been compared to the vertebrate
diencephalic forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain and spinal cord on the basis of the
cell architecture from serial electron micrographs and patterns of developmental 
gene expression. In addition, genes specifying the neural plate and neural plate 
border as well as Gbx and Otx, that position the midbrain/hindbrain boundary
(MHB), are expressed in comparable patterns in amphioxus and vertebrates.
However, migratory neural crest is lacking in amphioxus, and although it has
homologs of the genes that specify neural crest, they are not expressed at the
edges of the amphioxus neural plate. Similarly, amphioxus has the genes that
specify organizer properties of the MHB, but they are not expressed at the
Gbx/Otx boundary as in vertebrates. Thus, the genetic machinery that created
migratory neural crest and an MHB organizer was present in the ancestral
chordate, but only co-opted for these new roles in vertebrates. Analyses with the
amphioxus genome project strongly support the idea of two rounds of whole genome 
duplication with subsequent gene losses in the vertebrate lineage. Duplicates of 
developmental genes were preferentially retained. Although some genes apparently 
acquired roles in neural crest prior to these genome duplications, other key
genes (e.g., FoxD3 in neural crest and Wnt1 at the MHB) were recruited into the
respective gene networks after one or both genome duplications, suggesting that
such an expansion of the genetic toolkit was critical for the evolution of these 
structures. The toolkit has also increased by alternative splicing. Contrary to
the general rule, for at least one gene family with key roles in neural crest and
the MHB, namely Pax genes, alternative splicing has not decreased subsequent to
gene duplication. Thus, vertebrates have a much larger number of proteins
available for mediating new functions in these tissues. The creation of new
splice forms typically changes protein structure more than evolution of the
protein after gene duplication. The functions of particular isoforms of key
proteins expressed at the MHB and in neural crest have only just begun to be
studied. Their roles in modulating gene networks may turn out to rival gene
duplication for facilitating the evolution of structures such as neural crest and
the MHB.

The Foxd3 forkhead transcription factor is required for maintaining pluripotent
cells in the early mouse embryo and for the establishment of murine embryonic
stem cell (ESC) lines. To begin to understand the role of Foxd3 in ESC
maintenance, we derived ESC lines from blastocysts that carried two conditional
Foxd3 alleles and a tamoxifen-inducible Cre transgene. Tamoxifen treatment
produced a rapid and near complete loss of Foxd3 mRNA and protein.
Foxd3-deficient ESCs maintained a normal proliferation rate but displayed
increased apoptosis, and clonally dispersed ESCs showed a decreased ability to
self-renew. Under either self-renewal or differentiation-promoting culture
conditions we observed a strong, precocious differentiation of Foxd3 mutant ESCs 
along multiple lineages, including trophectoderm, endoderm, and mesendoderm. This
profound alteration in biological behavior occurred in the face of continued
expression of factors known to induce pluripotency, including Oct4, Sox2, and
Nanog. We present a model for the role of Foxd3 in repressing differentiation,
promoting self-renewal, and maintaining survival of mouse ESCs. Disclosure of
potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this article.

The emergence of the neural crest has been proposed to play a key role in early
vertebrate evolution by remodeling the chordate head into a "new head" that
enabled early vertebrates to shift from filter feeding to active predation. Here 
we show that the genome of the basal chordate, amphioxus, contains homologs of
most vertebrate genes implicated in a putative neural crest gene regulatory
network (NC-GRN) for neural crest development. Our survey of gene expression
shows that early inducing signals, neural plate border patterning genes, and
melanocyte differentiation genes appear conserved. Furthermore, exogenous BMP
affects expression of amphioxus neural plate border genes as in vertebrates,
suggesting that conserved signals specify the neural plate border throughout
chordates. In contrast to this core conservation, many neural crest specifier
genes are not expressed at the amphioxus neural plate/tube border, raising the
intriguing possibility that this level of the network was co-opted during
vertebrate evolution. Consistent with this, the regulatory region of AmphiFoxD,
homologous to the vertebrate neural crest specifier FoxD3, drives tissue-specific
reporter expression in chick mesoderm, but not neural crest. Thus, evolution of a
new regulatory element may have allowed co-option of this gene to the NC-GRN.

[Two vital transcriptional factors Oct-4 and Nanog to keep the pluripotency and

Oct-4 and Nanog are two critical transcriptional factors to keep pluripotency and
self-renewal of stem cells in vivo and in vitro, and they usually express only in
pluripotent cells and not in differentiated cells. They bind to the regulatory
regions of targeted gene and often interact with other transcriptional factors
and extracellular signal path components, such as Sox-2, FoxD3, LIF and BMP in
specific tissues or developmental stages. So that all of these constitute a
transcriptional crosstalk, and finally determine the cells destiny: keeping
pluripotency or turning to differentiation.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms of stem cell maintenance is crucial for
the ultimate goal of manipulating stem cells for the treatment of disease. Foxd3 
is required early in mouse embryogenesis; Foxd3(-/-) embryos fail around the time
of implantation, cells of the inner cell mass cannot be maintained in vitro, and 
blastocyst-derived stem cell lines cannot be established. Here, we report that
Foxd3 is required for maintenance of the multipotent mammalian neural crest.
Using tissue-specific deletion of Foxd3 in the neural crest, we show that
Foxd3(flox/-); Wnt1-Cre mice die perinatally with a catastrophic loss of neural
crest-derived structures. Cranial neural crest tissues are either missing or
severely reduced in size, the peripheral nervous system consists of reduced
dorsal root ganglia and cranial nerves, and the entire gastrointestinal tract is 
devoid of neural crest derivatives. These results demonstrate a global role for
this transcriptional repressor in all aspects of neural crest maintenance along
the anterior-posterior axis, and establish an unprecedented molecular link
between multiple divergent progenitor lineages of the mammalian embryo.

Lrig3 regulates neural crest formation in Xenopus by modulating Fgf and Wnt
signaling pathways.

Zhao H(1), Tanegashima K, Ro H, Dawid IB.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 3 (Lrig3) was identified by 
microarray analysis among genes that show differential expression during
gastrulation in Xenopus laevis. Lrig3 was expressed in the neural plate and
neural crest (NC) at neurula stages, and in NC derivatives and other dorsal
structures during tailbud stages. A prominent consequence of the
morpholino-induced inhibition of Lrig3 expression was impaired NC formation, as
revealed by the suppression of marker genes, including Slug, Sox9 and Foxd3. In
the NC induction assay involving Chordin plus Wnt3a-injected animal caps, Lrig3
morpholino inhibited expression of Slug, Sox9 and Foxd3, but not of Pax3 and
Zic1. In line with this, Lrig3 knockdown prevented NC marker induction by Pax3
and Zic1, suggesting that Lrig3 acts downstream of these two genes in NC
formation. Injection of Lrig3 and Wnt3a led to low-level induction of NC markers 
and enhanced induction of Fgf3, Fgf4 and Fgf8 in animal caps, suggesting a
positive role for Lrig3 in Wnt signaling. Lrig3 could attenuate Fgf signaling in 
animal caps, did interact with Fgf receptor 1 in cultured cells and, according to
context, decreased or increased the induction of NC markers by Fgf. We suggest
that Lrig3 functions in NC formation in Xenopus by modulating the Wnt and Fgf
signaling pathways.

colgate/hdac1 Repression of foxd3 expression is required to permit
mitfa-dependent melanogenesis.

Neural crest-derived pigment cell development has been used extensively to study 
cell fate specification, migration, proliferation, survival and differentiation. 
Many of the genes and regulatory mechanisms required for pigment cell development
are conserved across vertebrates. The zebrafish mutant colgate (col)/histone
deacetylase1 (hdac1) has reduced numbers, delayed differentiation and decreased
migration of neural crest-derived melanophores and their precursors. In
hdac1(col) mutants normal numbers of premigratory neural crest cells are induced.
Later, while there is only a slight reduction in the number of neural crest cells
in hdac1(col) mutants, there is a severe reduction in the number of
mitfa-positive melanoblasts suggesting that hdac1 is required for melanoblast
specification. Concomitantly, there is a significant increase in and prolonged
expression of foxd3 in neural crest cells in hdac1(col) mutants. We found that
partially reducing Foxd3 expression in hdac1(col) mutants rescues mitfa
expression and the melanophore defects in hdac1(col) mutants. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the ability of Foxd3 to physically interact at the mitfa promoter.
Because mitfa is required for melanoblast specification and development, our
results suggest that hdac1 is normally required to suppress neural crest foxd3
expression thus de-repressing mitfa resulting in melanogenesis by a subset of
neural crest-derived cells.

Investigations of the molecular mechanisms underlying major depressive disorder
(MDD) have been hampered by the complexity of brain tissue and sensitivity of
gene expression profiling approaches. To address these issues, we used discrete
microdissections of postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (area 9)
and an oligonucleotide (60mer) microarray hybridization procedure that increases 
sensitivity without RNA amplification. Mixed-effects statistical methods were
used to rigorously control for medication usage in the subset of medicated
depressed subjects. These analyses yielded a rich profile of dysregulated genes. 
Two of the most highly dysregulated genes of interest were stresscopin, a
neuropeptide involved in stress responses, and Forkhead box D3 (FOXD3), a
transcription factor. Secondary cell-based analysis demonstrated that stresscopin
and FoxD3 are increased in neurons of DLPFC gray matter of MDD subjects. These
findings identify abnormal gene expression in a discrete region of MDD subjects
and contribute to further elucidation of the molecular alterations of this
complex mood disorder.

Control of kidney, eye and limb expression of Bmp7 by an enhancer element highly 
conserved between species.

Adams D(1), Karolak M, Robertson E, Oxburgh L.

Author information: 
(1)Maine Medical Center Research Institute, 81 Research Drive, Scarborough, Maine
04074, USA.

Bmp7 is expressed in numerous tissues throughout development and is required for 
morphogenesis of the eye, hindlimb and kidney. In this study we show that the
majority if not all of the cis-regulatory sequence governing expression at these 
anatomical sites during development is present in approximately 20 kb surrounding
exon 1. In eye, limb and kidney, multiple distinct enhancer elements drive Bmp7
expression within each organ. In the eye, the elements driving expression in the 
pigmented epithelium and iris are spatially separated. In the kidney, Bmp7
expression in collecting ducts and nephron progenitors is driven by separate
enhancer elements. Similarly, limb mesenchyme and apical ectodermal ridge
expression are governed by separate elements. Although enhancers for pigmented
epithelium, nephrogenic mesenchyme and apical ectodermal ridge are distributed
across the approximately 20 kb region, an element of approximately 480 base pairs
within intron 1 governs expression within the developing iris, collecting duct
system of the kidney and limb mesenchyme. This element is remarkably conserved
both in sequence and position in the Bmp7 locus between different vertebrates,
ranging from Xenopus tropicalis to Homo sapiens, demonstrating that there is
strong selective pressure for Bmp7 expression at these tissue sites. Furthermore,
we show that the frog enhancer functions appropriately in transgenic mice.
Interestingly, the intron 1 element cannot be found in the Bmp7 genes of
vertebrates such as Danio rerio and Takifugu rubripes indicating that this
modification of the Bmp7 gene might have arisen during the adaptation from
aquatic to terrestrial life. Mutational analysis demonstrates that the enhancer
activity of the intron 1 element is entirely dependent on the presence of a 10
base pair site within the intron 1 enhancer containing a predicted binding site
for the FOXD3 transcription factor.

The origin of the turtle plastron is not well understood, and these nine bones
have been homologized to the exoskeletal components of the clavicles, the
interclavicular bone, and gastralia. Earlier data from our laboratory showed that
the plastral bone-forming cells stained positively for HNK-1 and PDGFRa, two
markers of skeletogenic neural crest cells. We have now shown that the HNK-1(+)
cells are also positive for p75 and FoxD3, affirming their neural crest identity.
These cells originate from the dorsal neural tube of stage-17 turtle embryos,
several days after the original wave of neural crest cells have migrated and
differentiated. Moreover, we have demonstrated the existence of a staging area,
above the neural tube and vertebrae, where these late-emigrating neural crest
cells collect. After residing in the carapacial staging area, these cells migrate
to form the plastral bones. We also demonstrate that one bone of the carapace,
the nuchal bone, also stains with HNK-1 and with antibodies to PDGFRa. The nuchal
bone shares several other properties with the plastral bones, suggesting that it,
too, is derived from neural crest cells. Alligator gastralia stain for HNK-1,
while their ribs do not, thus suggesting that the gastralial precursor may also
be derived from neural crest cells.

Pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have the distinguishing feature of
innate capacity to allow indefinite self-renewal. This attribute continues until 
specific constraints or restrictions, such as DNA methylation, are imposed on the
genome, usually accompanied by differentiation. With the aim of utilizing DNA
methylation as a sign of early differentiation, we probed the genomic regions of 
hESCs, particularly focusing on stem cell marker (SCM) genes to identify
regulatory sequences that display differentiation-sensitive alterations in DNA
methylation. We show that the promoter regions of OCT4 and NANOG, but not SOX2,
REX1 and FOXD3, undergo significant methylation during hESCs differentiation in
which SCM genes are substantially repressed. Thus, following exposure to
differentiation stimuli, OCT4 and NANOG gene loci are modified relatively rapidly
by DNA methylation. Accordingly, we propose that the DNA methylation states of
OCT4 and NANOG sequences may be utilized as barometers to determine the extent of
hESC differentiation.

Isolation and characterization of EG-like cells from Chinese swamp buffalo
(Bubalus bubalis).

There have been few studies done on the isolation and characterization of Chinese
swamp buffalo embryonic germ cells (EG cells). Here, we first report on EG-like
cells isolated from Chinese swamp buffalo fetuses. The results showed the cells
grew in large, multilayered colonies, which were densely packed with an obvious
border resembling mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells) and EG cells. The buffalo
EG-like cells expressed AP, SSEA-1, SSEA-3, SSEA-4 and OCT-4. By RT-PCR, we found
that undifferentiated swamp buffalo EG-like cells expressed the OCT-4, NANOG,
SOX2, FOXD3, GP130, STAT3, and HEB gene mRNA, but not Fgf4. When these cells were
cultured for more than 2weeks without passage, they could differentiate into
several types of cells including fibroblast-like, neuron-like, smooth
muscle-like, and epithelial-like cells. Some cells formed simple embryoid bodies 
(EBs) and cystic EBs by suspension culture. By RT-PCR, we found cystic EBs
expressed FOXD3, GP130, STAT3 and HEB gene mRNA, but not OCT-4, NANOG, and SOX2
gene mRNA, which could be detected in undifferentiated buffalo EG-like cells. At 
the same time, the expression of KERATIN-14 (Endoderm), GATA4, ACTA2 (Mesoderm)
and TUBB3 (Ectoderm) gene mRNA were also detected in cystic EBs. The results
suggested that these cells were capable of forming three germ layers in in vitro 
differentiation. The expression of OCT-4, NANOG and SOX2 might be essential for
Chinese swamp buffalo EG-like cells in a pluripotent state. During the isolation 
and culture of Chinese swamp buffalo EG-like cells, we found the fetuses that
were at 30-80days post-coitus were more efficient than others; and the mechanical
method was better than trypsin digestion. The maximal passage of the mechanical
method was eight, but the trypsin digestion was just three passages. So it seemed
like that the buffalo EG-like cells were sensitive to trypsin. In summary, we
were the first to isolate and characterize Chinese swamp buffalo EG-like cells
that had morphology and characterization similar to those of established
EG/EG-like cells in mouse and human.

The origin of the turtle plastron is not known, but these nine bones have been
homologized to the exoskeletal components of the clavicles, the interclavicular
bone, and gastralia. Earlier evidence from our laboratory showed that the
bone-forming cells of the plastron were positive for HNK-1 and PDGFRalpha, two
markers of the skeletogenic neural crest. This study looks at the embryonic
origin of these plastron-forming cells. We show that the HNK-1+ cells are also
positive for p75 and FoxD3, confirming their neural crest identity, and that they
originate from the dorsal neural tube of stage 17 turtle embryos, several days
after the original wave of neural crest cells have migrated and differentiated.
DiI studies show that these are migratory cells, and they can be observed in the 
lateral regions of the embryo and can be seen forming intramembranous bone in the
ventral (plastron) regions. Before migrating ventrally, these late-emerging
neural crest cells reside for over a week in a carapacial staging area above the 
neural tube and vertebrae. It is speculated that this staging area is where they 
lose the inability to form skeletal cells.

Xenopus hairy2 functions in neural crest formation by maintaining cells in a
mitotic and undifferentiated state.

Nagatomo K(1), Hashimoto C.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, Graduate School of Science, Osaka University, and JT
Biohistory Research Hall, Osaka, Japan.

The neural crest is a population of mitotically active, multipotent progenitor
cells that arise at the neural plate border. Neural crest progenitors must be
maintained in a multipotent state until after neural tube closure. However, the
molecular underpinnings of this process have yet to be fully elucidated. Here we 
show that the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional repressor gene,
Xenopus hairy2 (Xhairy2), is an essential early regulator of neural crest
formation in Xenopus. During gastrulation, Xhairy2 is localized at the
presumptive neural crest prior to the expression of such neural crest markers as 
Slug and FoxD3. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of Xhairy2 results in the
repression of neural crest marker gene expression while inducing the ectopic
expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27(xic1) in the presumptive neural crest.
We also found that ectopic p27(xic1) disturbs neural crest formation.
Furthermore, the depletion of Xhairy2 leads to the apoptosis of mitotic cells.
Our results suggest that Xhairy2 functions in neural crest specification by
maintaining cells in the mitotic and undifferentiated state.

Several extrinsic signals such as LIF, BMP and Wnt can support the self-renewal
and pluripotency of embryonic stem (ES) cells through regulating the "pluripotent
genes." A unique homeobox transcription factor, Nanog, is one of the key
downstream effectors of these signals. Elevated level of Nanog can maintain the
mouse ES cell self-renewal independent of LIF and enable human ES cell growth
without feeder cells. In addition to the external signal pathways, intrinsic
transcription factors such as FoxD3, P53 and Oct4 are also involved in regulating
the expression of Nanog. Functionally, Nanog works together with other key
pluripotent factors such as Oct4 and Sox2 to control a set of target genes that
have important functions in ES cell pluripotency. These key factors form a
regulatory network to support or limit each other's expression level, which
maintains the properties of ES cells.

FoxD3 and Grg4 physically interact to repress transcription and induce mesoderm
in Xenopus.

FoxD3 is a forkhead-related transcriptional regulator that is essential for
multiple developmental processes in the vertebrate embryo, including neural crest
development and maintenance of mammalian stem cell lineages. Recent results
demonstrate a requirement for FoxD3 in Xenopus mesodermal development. In the
gastrula, FoxD3 functions as a transcriptional repressor in the Spemann organizer
to maintain the expression of Nodal-related members of the transforming growth
factor-beta superfamily that induce dorsal mesoderm formation. Here we report
that the function of FoxD3 in mesoderm induction is dependent on the recruitment 
of transcriptional corepressors of the TLE/Groucho family. Structure-function
analyses indicate that the transcriptional repression and mesoderm induction
activities of FoxD3 are dependent on a C-terminal domain, as well as specific
DNA-binding activity conferred by the forkhead domain. The C-terminal domain
contains a heptapeptide similar to the eh1/GEH Groucho interaction motif.
Deletion and point mutagenesis demonstrated that the FoxD3 eh1/GEH motif is
required for both repression of transcription and induction of mesoderm, as well 
as the direct physical interaction of FoxD3 and Grg4 (Groucho-related gene-4).
Consistent with a functional interaction of FoxD3 and Grg4, the transcriptional
repression activity of FoxD3 is enhanced by Grg4, and reduced by Grg5, a dominant
inhibitory Groucho protein. The results indicate that FoxD3 recruitment of
Groucho corepressors is essential for the transcriptional repression of target
genes and induction of mesoderm in Xenopus.

FoxD3 regulation of Nodal in the Spemann organizer is essential for Xenopus
dorsal mesoderm development.

Induction and patterning of the mesodermal germ layer is a key early step of
vertebrate embryogenesis. We report that FoxD3 function in the Xenopus gastrula
is essential for dorsal mesodermal development and for Nodal expression in the
Spemann organizer. In embryos and explants, FoxD3 induced mesodermal genes,
convergent extension movements and differentiation of axial tissues.
Engrailed-FoxD3, but not VP16-FoxD3, was identical to native FoxD3 in
mesoderm-inducing activity, indicating that FoxD3 functions as a transcriptional 
repressor to induce mesoderm. Antagonism of FoxD3 with VP16-FoxD3 or
morpholino-knockdown of FoxD3 protein resulted in a complete block to axis
formation, a loss of mesodermal gene expression, and an absence of axial
mesoderm, indicating that transcriptional repression by FoxD3 is required for
mesodermal development. FoxD3 induced mesoderm in a non-cell-autonomous manner,
indicating a role for secreted inducing factors in the response to FoxD3.
Consistent with this mechanism, FoxD3 was necessary and sufficient for the
expression of multiple Nodal-related genes, and inhibitors of Nodal signaling
blocked mesoderm induction by FoxD3. Therefore, FoxD3 is required for Nodal
expression in the Spemann organizer and this function is essential for dorsal
mesoderm formation.

Clonally cultured differentiated pigment cells can dedifferentiate and generate
multipotent progenitors with self-renewing potential.

The differentiation of a given cell should be irreversible in order to ensure
cell-type-specific function and stability of resident tissue. However, under
stimulation in vitro or during regeneration, differentiated cells may recover
properties of immature cells. Yet the mechanisms whereby differentiated cells can
change fate or reverse to precursor cells are poorly understood. We show here
that neural crest (NC)-derived pigment cells that have differentiated in quail
embryo, when isolated from the skin and clonally cultured in vitro, are able to
generate glial and myofibroblastic cells. The phenotypic reprogramming involves
dedifferentiation of dividing pigment cells into cells that re-express NC early
marker genes Sox10, FoxD3, Pax3 and Slug. Single melanocytes generate multipotent
progenitors able to self-renew along serial subcloning, thus exhibiting stem cell
properties. The presence of endothelin 3 promotes the emergence and maintenance
of multipotent progenitors in melanocyte progeny. These multipotent cells are
heterogeneous with respect to marker identity, including pigmented cells and
dedifferentiated cells that have reacquired expression of the early NC marker
HNK1. These data provide evidence that, when removed from their niche and
subjected to appropriate culture conditions, pigment cells are phenotypically
unstable and can reverse to their NC-like ancestors endowed with self-renewal
capacity.

The mother superior mutation ablates foxd3 activity in neural crest progenitor
cells and depletes neural crest derivatives in zebrafish.

The zebrafish mutation mother superior (mosm188) leads to a depletion of neural
crest (NC) derivatives including the craniofacial cartilage skeleton, the
peripheral nervous system (sympathetic neurons, dorsal root ganglia, enteric
neurons), and pigment cells. The loss of derivatives is preceded by a reduction
in NC-expressed transcription factors, snail1b, sox9b, sox10, and a specific loss
of foxd3 expression in NC progenitor cells. We employed genetic linkage analysis 
and physical mapping to place the mosm188 mutation on zebrafish chromosome 6 in
the vicinity of the foxd3 gene. Furthermore, we found that mosm188 does not
complement the sym1/foxd3 mutation, indicating that mosm188 resides within the
foxd3 locus. Injection of PAC clones containing the foxd3 gene into mosm188
embryos restored foxd3 expression in NC progenitors and suppressed the mosm188
phenotype. However, sequencing the foxd3 transcribed area in mosm188 embryos did 
not reveal nucleotide changes segregating with the mosm188 phenotype, implying
that the mutation most likely resides outside the foxd3-coding region. Based on
these findings, we propose that the mosm188 mutation perturbs a NC-specific foxd3
regulatory element. Further analysis of mosm188 mutants and foxd3 morphants
revealed that NC cells are initially formed, suggesting that foxd3 function is
required to maintain the pool of NC progenitors.

Embryonic stem (ES) cells possess the ability to renew themselves while
maintaining the capacity to differentiate into virtually all cell types of the
body. Current evidence suggests that ES cells maintain their pluripotent state by
expressing a battery of transcription factors including Oct4 and Nanog. However, 
little is known about how ES cells maintain the expression of these pluripotent
factors in ES cells. Here we present evidence that Oct4, Nanog, and FoxD3 form a 
negative feedback loop to maintain their expression in pluripotent ES cells.
First, Oct4 maintains Nanog activity by directly activating its promoter at
sub-steady-state concentration but repressing it at or above steady-state levels.
On the other hand, FoxD3 behaves as a positive activator of Nanog to counter the 
repressive effect of Oct4. The expression of Oct4 is activated by FoxD3 and Nanog
but repressed by Oct4 itself, thus, exerting an important negative feedback loop 
to limit its own activity. Indeed, overexpression of either FoxD3 or Nanog in ES 
cells failed to increase the concentration of Oct4 beyond the steady-state
concentration, whereas knocking down either FoxD3 or Nanog reduces the expression
of Oct4 in ES cells. Finally, overexpression of Oct4 or Nanog failed to
compensate the loss of Nanog or Oct4, respectively, suggesting that both are
required for ES self-renewal and pluripotency. Our results suggest the
FoxD3-Nanog-Oct4 loop anchors an interdependent network of transcription factors 
that regulate stem cell pluripotency.

Genome duplications of early vertebrates as a possible chronicle of the
evolutionary history of the neural crest.

It is now accepted that ancestral vertebrates underwent two rounds of genome
duplication. Here we test the possible utility of these genome duplication events
as a reference time for the evolutionary history of vertebrates, by tracing the
molecular evolutionary history of the genes involved in vertebrate neural crest
development. For most transcription factors that are involved in neural crest
specification, more than two paralogs are involved in that process. These were
likely involved in the specification of the neural crest before the genome
duplications occurred in ancestral vertebrates, although FoxD3 may have acquired 
that role after the genome duplications. By contrast, the epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition of neural crest cells is controlled by genes that evolved after the
genome duplications, such as cadherin6, cadherin7, cadherin11, and rhoB. This
suggests that primitive neural crest cells control their delamination by using a 
small or distinct set of cell adhesion molecules. Alternatively, these
observations suggest that delamination of the neural crest evolved after the
genome duplications. In that case, the neural crest might have evolved in
sequential steps; the specification of the neural crest occurred before the
genome duplications, and the neural crest acquired a new cell migration property 
after the genome duplications.

Multipotent progenitor cells self renew throughout an animal's lifetime and can
differentiate to give rise to different cell types. Before we can fully
understand the developmental potential of progenitor cells and control their
differentiation both in vivo and in vitro as stem cells, identification and
characterization of the genes that control stem cell fate must first be obtained.
Foxd3, a member of the forkhead family of transcriptional regulators, is required
for the maintenance of embryonic stem cells and trophoblast stem cells of the
early mouse embryo. We describe here the expression of this protein in the
developing pancreas. Foxd3 is expressed in most beta cells and infrequently in
alpha and PP cells but is not expressed in somatostatin cells. The subcellular
localization of Foxd3 varies with fat content in the diet; with a high fat diet
the protein is found primarily in the cytoplasm while a low fat diet results in
nuclear localization. Foxd3 is differentially localized in a rat model of
diabetes: it is nuclear in ZDF rats but cytoplasmic in their lean counterparts.
Foxd3 is nuclear in Lep(Ob/Ob) mice.

Nodal specifies embryonic visceral endoderm and sustains pluripotent cells in the

Anteroposterior (AP) polarity in the mammalian embryo is specified during
gastrulation when naive progenitor cells in the primitive ectoderm are recruited 
into the primitive streak to form mesoderm and endoderm. At the opposite pole,
this process is inhibited by signals previously induced in distal visceral
endoderm (DVE). Both DVE and primitive streak formation, and hence positioning of
the AP axis, rely on the TGFbeta family member Nodal and its proprotein
convertases Furin and Pace4. Here, we show that Nodal and Furin are initially
co-expressed in the primitive endoderm together with a subset of DVE markers such
as Lefty1 and Hex. However, with the appearance of extra-embryonic ectoderm
(ExE), DVE formation is transiently inhibited. During this stage, Nodal activity 
is essential to specify embryonic VE and restrict the expression of Furin to the 
extra-embryonic region. Activation of Nodal is also necessary to maintain
determinants of pluripotency such as Oct4, Nanog and Foxd3 during implantation,
and to stimulate elongation of the egg cylinder, before inducing DVE and germ
layer formation. We conclude that Nodal is already activated in primitive
endoderm, but induces a functional DVE only after promoting the expansion of
embryonic VE and pluripotent progenitor cells in the epiblast.

Human pluripotent embryonic stem cells (hESC) have great promise for research
into human developmental biology and the development of cell therapies for the
treatment of diseases. To meet the increased demand for characterized hESC lines,
we present the derivation and characterization of five hESC lines on mouse

long-term expansion, and expression profiles of a number of specific markers,
including TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, alkaline phosphatase, connexin 43, OCT-4, NANOG,
CXCR4, NODAL, LEFTY2, THY-1, TDGF1, PAX6, FOXD3, SOX2, EPHA2, FGF4, TAL1, AC133
and REX-1. The pluripotency of the cell line was confirmed by spontaneous
differentiation under in vitro conditions. Whereas all of the cell lines
expressed all the characteristics of undifferentiated pluripotent hESC, two of
the cell lines carried a triploid karyotype.

Zebrafish foxd3 is selectively required for neural crest specification, migration

The vertebrate neural crest is a pluripotent cell population that generates a
large variety of cell types, including peripheral neurons, cartilage and pigment 
cells. Mechanisms that control the patterning of the neural crest toward specific
cell fates remain only partially understood. Zebrafish homozygous for the
sympathetic mutation 1 (sym1) have defects in a subset of neural crest
derivatives, such as peripheral neurons, glia and cartilage, but retain normal
numbers of melanocytes. The sym1 mutation is a nucleotide deletion that disrupts 
the forkhead DNA-binding domain of the foxd3 gene, which encodes a conserved
winged-helix transcription factor. We show that sym1 mutants have normal numbers 
of premigratory neural crest cells, but these cells express reduced levels of
snai1b and sox10, implicating foxd3 as an essential regulator of these
transcription factors in the premigratory neural crest. The onset of neural crest
migration is also delayed in sym1 mutants, and there is a reduction in the number
of migratory trunk neural crest cells, particularly along the medial migration
pathway. TUNEL analysis revealed aberrant apoptosis localized to the hindbrain
neural crest at the 15-somite stage, indicating a critical role for foxd3 in the 
survival of a subpopulation of neural crest cells. These results show that foxd3 
selectively specifies premigratory neural crest cells for a neuronal, glial or
cartilage fate, by inducing the expression of lineage-associated transcription
factors in these cells and regulating their subsequent migration.

The Olfactomedin family is a relatively new class of extracellular proteins. Two 
family members have been shown to play roles in the early development of
ectodermal tissues: Noelin enhances neural crest generation in chick and Tiarin
promotes dorsal neural specification in Xenopus. In this study, we introduce a
novel member of the Olfactomedin family, ONT1. In the early chick embryo, ONT1
expression first appears at Hensen's node and subsequently in the axial and
paraxial mesoderm. When the neural tube closes, strong expression of ONT1 is
transiently found in the roof plate region from the rostral midbrain to the
hindbrain. Overexpression of ONT1 in these regions prolongs the generation of
neural crest cells in a manner similar to that of Noelin. Interestingly, ONT1 and
Noelin have opposing effects on the expression of the migrating neural crest
marker HNK-1 in the chick: they, respectively, cause suppression and ectopic
induction of this marker. Differential activities among Olfactomedin-related
factors are further examined in Xenopus. Microinjection of ONT1 mRNA into the
Xenopus embryo expands the expression domain of the neural crest marker FoxD3 at 
the neurula stage whereas overexpression of Tiarin or Noelin suppresses FoxD3.
ONT1 exhibits no dorsalizing effects on the Xenopus neural tube, which contrasts 
with the strong dorsalizing activity seen for Tiarin. Thus, distinct
Olfactomedin-related factors evoke qualitatively different phenotypes even in the
same experimental systems, suggesting that Olfactomedin family uses multiple
response systems to mediate its signals in embryogenesis.

Myf5, one of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, controls muscle
differentiation and is expressed in somites during early embryogenesis. However, 
the transcription factors bound to the cis-elements of myf5 are poorly
understood. In this study, we used the yeast one-hybrid assay and found that
Forkhead box d3 (Foxd3) interacted specifically with the -82/-62 cassette, a key 
element directing somite-specific expression of myf5. The dual-luciferase assay
revealed that the expression of Foxd3 potently transactivated the myf5 promoter. 
Knocking down foxd3 with morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) resulted in a dramatic
down-regulation of myf5 in somites and adaxial cells but not in the presomitic
mesoderm. On the other hand, myod expression remained unchanged in foxd3
morphants. Foxd3 mediation of myf5 expression is stage-dependent, maintaining
myf5 expression in the somites and adaxial cells during the 7- to 18-somite
stage. Furthermore, in the pax3 morphant, the expression of foxd3 was
down-regulated greatly and the expression of myf5 was similar to that of the
foxd3 morphant. Co-injection of foxd3 mRNA and pax3-MO1 greatly restored the
expression of myf5 in the somites and adaxial cells, suggesting that pax3 induces
foxd3 expression, which then induces the expression of myf5. This report is the
first study to show that Foxd3, a well-known regulator in neural crest
development, is also involved in myf5 regulation.

foxd3 encodes a winged helix/forkhead class transcription factor expressed in the
premigratory neural crest cells of many vertebrates. We have investigated the
function of this gene in zebrafish neural crest by a loss of function approach
using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides and immunostaining for Foxd3 protein.
Knockdown of Foxd3 expression produces deficits in several differentiated neural 
crest derivatives, including jaw cartilage, peripheral neurons, and glia, and
iridophore pigment cells. Other derivatives, such as melanophore and xanthophore 
pigment cells are not affected. Reduction in the expression of several
lineage-specific markers becomes evident soon after the onset of neural crest
migration, suggesting that Foxd3 knockdown affects these lineages at early stages
in their development. In contrast, analysis of the expression of early neural
crest markers indicates little effect on neural crest induction or initial
emigration. Finally, cell transplantation suggests that with respect to dorsal
root ganglia neurons the Foxd3 requirement is cell autonomous, although Foxd3
itself is not detectable in differentiated DRG neurons. These results suggest
that in zebrafish Foxd3 may not be required for induction of neural crest
identity but is necessary for the differentiation of a subset of neural crest
cell fates, perhaps in precursors of particular neural crest lineages.

hormone (GnRH) cells in the zebrafish Danio rerio.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is found in a wide range of vertebrate
tissues, including the nervous system. In general, GnRH has two functions:
endocrine, acting as a releasing hormone; and neuromodulatory, affecting neural
activity in the peripheral and central nervous system. The best understood
population of GnRH cells is that of the hypothalamus, which is essential for
reproduction. Less well understood are the populations of GnRH cells found in the
terminal nerve and midbrain, which appear to be neuromodulatory in function. The 
GnRH-containing cells of the midbrain are proposed to arise from the
mesencephalic region of the neural tube. Previously, we showed that
neuromodulatory GnRH cells of the terminal nerve arise from cranial neural crest.
To test the hypothesis that neuromodulatory GnRH cells of the midbrain also arise
from neural crest, we used gene knockdown experiments in zebrafish to disrupt
neural crest development. We demonstrate that decrement of the function of foxd3 
and/or sox10, two genes important for the development and specification of neural
crest, resulted in a reduction and/or loss of GnRH cells of the midbrain, as well
as a reduction in the number of terminal nerve GnRH cells. Therefore, our data
support a neural crest origin for midbrain GnRH cells. Additionally, we
demonstrate that knockdown of kallmann gene function resulted in the loss of
endocrine GnRH cells of the hypothalamus, but not of neuromodulatory GnRH cells
of the midbrain and terminal nerve, thus providing additional evidence for
separate pathways controlling the development of neuromodulatory and endocrine
GnRH cells.

Gradual DNA demethylation of the Oct4 promoter in cloned mouse embryos.

During differentiation, somatic cell nuclei acquire unique patterns of epigenetic
modifications, such as DNA methylation, which affect the transcriptional activity
of specific genes. Upon transfer into oocytes, however, the somatic nucleus
undergoes reprogramming of these epigenetic modifications to achieve
pluripotency. Oct4 is one of the critical pluripotency regulators, and is
expressed in the germ line, including the pluripotent early embryonic cells.
Previous studies showed that the upstream regulatory sequences of the Oct4 gene
are distinctly methylated in somatic cells, and the DNA methylation of the
regulatory sequences suppresses the transcriptional activity. Thus, successful
reprogramming of the somatic cell nucleus to gain pluripotency must be
accompanied by the demethylation of the Oct4 regulatory sequences. Here, we
investigated the methylation pattern of the Oct4 promoter during early
development of cloned mouse embryos. We found that the Oct4 promoter was only
gradually demethylated during the early cleavage stages and that the ineffective 
demethylation of the promoter was associated with developmental retardation. We
also found that the upstream sequences of the other pluripotency regulators,
namely Nanog, Sox2, and Foxd3, were considerably under-methylated in cumulus
cells. These results suggest that the Oct4 gene, as compared to the other
pluripotency regulators, needs to undergo extensive demethylation during nuclear 
reprogramming, and that the failure of such demethylation is associated with
inefficient development of cloned somatic cell embryos.

Dynamic alterations in gene expression after Wnt-mediated induction of avian
neural crest.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125,

The Wnt signaling pathway is important in the formation of neural crest cells in 
many vertebrates, but the downstream targets of neural crest induction by Wnt are
largely unknown. Here, we examined quantitative changes in gene expression
regulated by Wnt-mediated neural crest induction using quantitative PCR (QPCR).
Induction was recapitulated in vitro by adding soluble Wnt to intermediate neural
plate tissue cultured in collagen, and induced versus control tissue were assayed
using gene-specific primers at times corresponding to premigratory (18 and 24 h) 
or early (36 h) stages of crest migration. The results show that Wnt signaling
up-regulates in a distinct temporal pattern the expression of several genes
normally expressed in the dorsal neural tube (slug, Pax3, Msx1, FoxD3, cadherin
6B) at "premigratory" stages. While slug is maintained in early migrating crest
cells, Pax3, FoxD3, Msx1 and cadherin 6B all are down-regulated by the start of
migration. These results differ from the temporal profile of these genes in
response to the addition of recombinant BMP4, where gene expression seems to be
maintained. Interestingly, expression of rhoB is unchanged or even decreased in
response to Wnt-mediated induction at all times examined, though it is
up-regulated by BMP signals. The temporal QPCR profiles in our culture paradigm
approximate in vivo expression patterns of these genes before neural crest
migration, and are consistent with Wnt being an initial neural crest inducer with
additional signals like BMP and other factors maintaining expression of these
genes in vivo. Our results are the first to quantitatively describe changes in
gene expression in response to a Wnt or BMP signal during transformation of a
neural tube cell into a migratory neural crest cell.

The neural crest is a multipotent cell population that arise at the border of the
neural plate and non-neural ectoderm. Studies conducted in a number of model
organisms including chickens, frogs, zebrafish and mice have been instrumental in
elucidating this molecular mechanisms underlying neural crest formation.
Signaling molecules of the Wnt, BMP, and FGF families and their downstream
effectors have been shown to mediate neural crest induction. Transcription
factors including members of the Snail and SoxE gene families as well as FoxD3,
c-Myc and others have been implicated in specification of the neural crest. These
studies represent an important step in understanding the regulatory interactions 
involved in generating this complex and interesting cell type.

Foxd3 is required in the trophoblast progenitor cell lineage of the mouse embryo.

The murine blastocyst contains two nonoverlapping pools of progenitor cells: the 
embryonic component contributes to the fetus and generates embryonic stem cells
in vitro, whereas the extraembryonic pool contributes to the placenta and
generates trophoblast stem cells in vitro. The transcriptional repressor Foxd3 is
required for maintenance of the epiblast and the in vitro establishment of
embryonic stem cell lines. Here, we demonstrate that Foxd3 is also required in
the trophoblast lineage. Trophoblast progenitors in Foxd3-/- embryos do not
self-renew and are not multipotent, but instead give rise to an excess of
trophoblast giant cells. Injection of Foxd3-/- blastocysts with wild type ES
cells fails to rescue Foxd3-/- placentas and such chimeras die around 10 days of 
embryogenesis. These results indicate an essential role for Foxd3 in two
nonoverlapping progenitor cell populations that require different secreted
factors to maintain their multipotent properties in vitro and give rise to
divergent tissues in vivo. Moreover, this provides support for the hypothesis
that there are conserved molecular mechanisms for maintaining the self-renewing
properties of diverse progenitor cell types.

Neural crest determination by co-activation of Pax3 and Zic1 genes in Xenopus
ectoderm.

Kobe 650-0047, Japan.

A number of regulatory genes have been implicated in neural crest development.
However, the molecular mechanism of how neural crest determination is initiated
in the exact ectodermal location still remains elusive. Here, we show that the
cooperative function of Pax3 and Zic1 determines the neural crest fate in the
amphibian ectoderm. Pax3 and Zic1 are expressed in an overlapping manner in the
presumptive neural crest area of the Xenopus gastrula, even prior to the onset of
the expression of the early bona fide neural crest marker genes Foxd3 and Slug.
Misexpression of both Pax3 and Zic1 together efficiently induces ectopic neural
crest differentiation in the ventral ectoderm, whereas overexpression of either
one of them only expands the expression of neural crest markers within the
dorsolateral ectoderm. The induction of neural crest differentiation by Pax3 and 
Zic1 requires Wnt signaling. Loss-of-function studies in vivo and in the animal
cap show that co-presence of Pax3 and Zic1 is essential for the initiation of
neural crest differentiation. Thus, co-activation of Pax3 and Zic1, in concert
with Wnt, plays a decisive role for early neural crest determination in the
correct place of the Xenopus ectoderm.

The transcriptional control of trunk neural crest induction, survival, and
delamination.

Author information:

Hill, London, NW7 1AA, UK.

Trunk neural crest cells are generated at the border between the neural plate and
nonneural ectoderm, where they initiate a distinct program of gene expression,
undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and delaminate from the
neuroepithelium. Here, we provide evidence that members of three families of
transcription induce these properties in premigratory neural crest cells. Sox9
acts to provide the competence for neural crest cells to undergo an EMT and is
required for trunk neural crest survival. In the absence of Sox9, cells apoptose 
prior to or shortly after delamination. Slug/Snail, in the presence of Sox9, is
sufficient to induce an EMT in neural epithelial cells, while FoxD3 regulates the
expression of cell-cell adhesion molecules required for neural crest migration.
Together, the data suggest a model in which a combination of transcription
factors regulates the acquisition of the diverse properties of neural crest
cells.

A pair of Sox: distinct and overlapping functions of zebrafish sox9 co-orthologs 
in craniofacial and pectoral fin development.

Understanding how developmental systems evolve after genome amplification is
important for discerning the origins of vertebrate novelties, including neural
crest, placodes, cartilage and bone. Sox9 is important for the development of
these features, and zebrafish has two co-orthologs of tetrapod SOX9 stemming from
an ancient genome duplication event in the lineage of ray-fin fish. We have used 
a genotype-driven screen to isolate a mutation deleting sox9b function, and
investigated its phenotype and genetic interactions with a sox9a null mutation.
Analysis of mutant phenotypes strongly supports the interpretation that ancestral
gene functions partitioned spatially and temporally between Sox9 co-orthologs.
Distinct subsets of the craniofacial skeleton, otic placode and pectoral
appendage express each gene, and are defective in each single mutant. The double 
mutant phenotype is additive or synergistic. Ears are somewhat reduced in each
single mutant but are mostly absent in the double mutant. Loss-of-function
animals from mutations and morpholino injections, and gain-of-function animals
injected with sox9a and sox9b mRNAs showed that sox9 helps regulate other early
crest genes, including foxd3, sox10, snai1b and crestin, as well as the cartilage
gene col2a1 and the bone gene runx2a; however, tfap2a was nearly unchanged in
mutants. Chondrocytes failed to stack in sox9a mutants, failed to attain proper
numbers in sox9b mutants and failed in both morphogenetic processes in double
mutants. Pleiotropy can cause mutations in single copy tetrapod genes, such as
Sox9, to block development early and obscure later gene functions. By contrast,
subfunction partitioning between zebrafish co-orthologs of tetrapod genes, such
as sox9a and sox9b, can relax pleiotropy and reveal both early and late
developmental gene functions.

Mammalian embryonic stem (ES) cells can either self-renew or generate progenitor 
cells that have a more restricted developmental potential. This provides an
important model system to ask how pluripotency, cell commitment and
differentiation are regulated at the level of chromatin-based changes that
distinguish stem cells from their differentiated progeny. Here we show that the
differentiation of ES cells to neural progenitors results in dynamic changes in
the epigenetic status of multiple genes that encode transcription factors
critical for early embryonic development or lineage specification. In particular,
we demonstrate that DNA replication at a subset of neural-associated genes
including Pax3, Pax6, Irx3, Nkx2.9 and Mash1 is advanced upon neural induction,
consistent with increased locus accessibility. Conversely, many ES-associated
genes including Oct4, Nanog, Utf1, Foxd3, Cripto and Rex1 that replicate early in
ES cells switch their replication timing to later in S-phase in response to
differentiation. Detailed analysis of the Rex1 locus reveals that delayed
replication extends to a 2.8 Mb region surrounding the gene and is associated
with substantial reductions in the level of histone H3K9 and H4 acetylation at
the promoter. These results show that loss of pluripotency (and lineage choice)
is associated with extensive and predictable changes in the replication timing of
key regulator genes.

Human Forkhead-box (FOX) gene family consists of at least 43 members, including
FOXA1, FOXA2, FOXA3, FOXB1, FOXC1, FOXC2, FOXD1, FOXD2, FOXD3, FOXD4, FOXD5
(FOXD4L1), FOXD6 (FOXD4L3), FOXE1, FOXE2, FOXE3, FOXF1, FOXF2, FOXG1 (FOXG1B),

FOXO2 (FOXO6), FOXO3 (FOXO3A), FOXO4 (MLLT7), FOXP1, FOXP2, FOXP3, FOXP4, and
FOXQ1. FOXE3-FOXD2 (1p33), FOXQ1-FOXF2-FOXC1 (6p25.3), and FOXF1-FOXC2-FOXL1
(16q24.1) loci are FOX gene clusters within the human genome. Members of FOX
subfamilies A-G, I-L and Q were grouped into class 1 FOX proteins, while members 
of FOX subfamilies H and M-P were grouped into class 2 FOX proteins. C-terminal
basic region within the FOX domain was the common feature of class 1 FOX
proteins. FOXH1 and FOXO1 mRNAs are expressed in human embryonic stem (ES) cells.
FOXC1, FOXC2, FOXE1, FOXE3, FOXL2, FOXN1, FOXP2 and FOXP3 genes are mutated in
human congenital disorders. FOXA1 gene is amplified and over-expressed in
esophageal and lung cancer. FOXM1 gene is up-regulated in pancreatic cancer and
basal cell carcinoma due to the transcriptional regulation by Sonic Hedgehog
(SHH) pathway. FOXO1 gene is fused to PAX3 or PAX7 genes in rhabdomyosarcoma.
FOXO3 and FOXO4 genes are fused to MLL gene in hematological malignancies.
Deregulation of FOX family genes leads to congenital disorders, diabetes
mellitus, or carcinogenesis. Expression profiles, genetic alterations and
epigenetic changes of FOX family genes as well as binding proteins and target
genes of FOX family transcription factors should be comprehensively investigated 
to develop novel therapeutics and preventives for human diseases.

Canonical Wnt activity regulates trunk neural crest delamination linking
BMP/noggin signaling with G1/S transition.

School, PO Box 12272, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.

Delamination of premigratory neural crest cells depends on a balance between
BMP/noggin and on successful G1/S transition. Here, we report that BMP regulates 
G1/S transition and consequent crest delamination through canonical Wnt
signaling. Noggin overexpression inhibits G1/S transition and blocking G1/S
abrogates BMP-induced delamination; moreover, transcription of Wnt1 is stimulated
by BMP and by the developing somites, which concomitantly inhibit noggin
production. Interfering with beta-catenin and LEF/TCF inhibits G1/S transition,
neural crest delamination and transcription of various BMP-dependent genes, which
include Cad6B, Pax3 and Msx1, but not that of Slug, Sox9 or FoxD3. Hence, we
propose that developing somites inhibit noggin transcription in the dorsal tube, 
resulting in activation of BMP and consequent Wnt1 production. Canonical Wnt
signaling in turn stimulates G1/S transition and generation of neural crest cell 
motility independently of its proposed role in earlier neural crest
specification.

LSox5 regulates RhoB expression in the neural tube and promotes generation of the
neural crest.

Perez-Alcala S(1), Nieto MA, Barbas JA.

Author information: 
(1)Instituto Cajal CSIC, Doctor Arce 37, 28002 Madrid, Spain.

Members of the Sox family of transcription factors are involved in a number of
crucial developmental processes, including sex determination, neurogenesis and
skeletal development. LSox5 is a member of the group D Sox factors that, in
conjunction with Sox6 and Sox9, promotes chondrogenesis by activating the
expression of cartilage-specific extracellular matrix molecules. We have cloned
the chicken homologue of LSox5 and found that it is initially expressed in the
premigratory and migratory neural crest after Slug and FoxD3. Subsequently, the
expression of LSox5 is maintained in cephalic crest derivatives, and it appears
to be required for the development of the glial lineage, the Schwann cells and
satellite glia in cranial ganglia. Misexpression of LSox5 in the cephalic neural 
tube activated RhoB expression throughout the dorsoventral axis. Furthermore, the
prolonged forced expression of LSox5 enlarged the dorsal territory in which the
neural crest is generated, extended the 'temporal window' of neural crest
segregation, and led to an overproduction of neural crest cells in cephalic
regions. In addition to HNK-1, the additional neural crest cells expressed
putative upstream markers (Slug, FoxD3) indicating that a regulatory feedback
mechanism may operate during neural crest generation. Thus, our data show that in
addition to the SoxE genes (Sox9 and Sox10) a SoxD gene (Sox5) also participates 
in neural crest development and that a cooperative interaction may operate during
neural crest generation, as seen during the formation of cartilage.

Oct-4 is a transcriptional regulator required to maintain the totipotentiality of
embryonic stem (ES) cells. Downregulation of its activity is required for proper 
differentiation of the blastocyst during uterine implantation. Uterine
implantation and subsequent vascularization increase oxygen exposure of the
developing embryo, thereby altering the intracellular reduction-oxidation status.
We tested whether Oct-4 could be regulated by these changes in
reduction-oxidation status. We found that Oct-4 DNA binding was exquisitely
sensitive to abrogation by oxidation but that the DNA binding of another ES cell 
transcription factor, FoxD3, was much less sensitive to oxidation. The reducing
enzyme Thioredoxin (but not Ape-1) could restore DNA-binding activity of Oct-4.
Thioredoxin was less effective at restoring the DNA-binding ability of FoxD3. It 
was also found that Thioredoxin (but not Ape-1) could physically associate with
cysteines in the POU domain of Oct-4. Finally, overexpressing normal Thioredoxin 
increased the transcriptional activity of Oct-4, while overexpressing a mutant
Thioredoxin decreased the transcriptional activity of Oct-4. These data imply
that ES cell transcription factors are differentially sensitive to oxidation and 
that Thioredoxin may differentially regulate ES cell transcription factors.

We compared gene expression profiles of mouse and human ES cells by
immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR, and membrane-based focused cDNA array analysis.
Several markers that in concert could distinguish undifferentiated ES cells from 
their differentiated progeny were identified. These included known markers such
as SSEA antigens, OCT3/4, SOX-2, REX-1 and TERT, as well as additional markers
such as UTF-1, TRF1, TRF2, connexin43, and connexin45, FGFR-4, ABCG-2, and
Glut-1. A set of negative markers that confirm the absence of differentiation was
also developed. These include genes characteristic of trophoectoderm, markers of 
germ layers, and of more specialized progenitor cells. While the expression of
many of the markers was similar in mouse and human cells, significant differences
were found in the expression of vimentin, beta-III tubulin, alpha-fetoprotein,
eomesodermin, HEB, ARNT, and FoxD3 as well as in the expression of the LIF
receptor complex LIFR/IL6ST (gp130). Profound differences in cell cycle
regulation, control of apoptosis, and cytokine expression were uncovered using
focused microarrays. The profile of gene expression observed in H1 cells was
similar to that of two other human ES cell lines tested (line I-6 and clonal
line-H9.2) and to feeder-free subclones of H1, H7, and H9, indicating that the
observed differences between human and mouse ES cells were species-specific
rather than arising from differences in culture conditions.

Neural crest progenitor cells are the main contributors to craniofacial cartilage
and connective tissue of the vertebrate head. These progenitor cells also give
rise to the pigment, neuronal and glial cell lineages. To study the molecular
basis of neural crest differentiation, we have cloned the gene disrupted in the
mont blanc (mob(m610)) mutation, which affects all neural crest derivatives.
Using a positional candidate cloning approach we identified an A to G transition 
within the 3' splice site of the sixth intron of the tfap2a gene that abolishes
the last exon encoding the crucial protein dimerization and DNA-binding domains. 
Neural crest induction and specification are not hindered in mob(m610) mutant
embryos, as revealed by normal expression of early neural crest specific genes
such as snail2, foxd3 and sox10. In addition, the initial stages of cranial
neural crest migration appear undisturbed, while at a later phase the
craniofacial primordia in pharyngeal arches two to seven fail to express their
typical set of genes (sox9a, wnt5a, dlx2, hoxa2/b2). In mob(m610) mutant embryos,
the cell number of neuronal and glial derivatives of neural crest is greatly
reduced, suggesting that tfap2a is required for their normal development. By
tracing the fate of neural crest progenitors in live mont blanc (mob(m610))
embryos, we found that at 24 hpf neural crest cells migrate normally in the first
pharyngeal arch while the preotic and postotic neural crest cells begin migration
but fail to descend to the pharyngeal region of the head. TUNEL assay and
Acridine Orange staining revealed that in the absence of tfap2a a subset of
neural crest cells are unable to undergo terminal differentiation and die by
apoptosis. Furthermore, surviving neural crest cells in tfap2a/mob(m610) mutant
embryos proliferate normally and later differentiate to individual derivatives.
Our results indicate that tfap2a is essential to turn on the normal developmental
program in arches 2-7 and in trunk neural crest. Thus, tfap2a does not appear to 
be involved in early specification and cell proliferation of neural crest, but it
is a key regulator of an early differentiation phase and is required for cell
survival in neural crest derived cell lineages.

Neural crest cells are the embryonic precursors of the neurons and glia of the
peripheral nervous system, pigment cells, and connective tissue in the face, neck
and heart. They are induced near the junction of the neural plate and embryonic
ectoderm and undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Neural crest 
cells then display invasive behavior and migrate into the surrounding tissues
along specific pathways. Neural crest cells are amenable to study in tissue
culture, and the molecules that regulate their development can be studied in vivo
with antisense techniques as well as with the expression of gain and
loss-of-function constructs. Mutations in factors that regulate neural crest cell
survival or differentiation can lead to cell death or the premature cessation of 
their migration, resulting in craniofacial abnormalities, pigmentation defects
and the absence of enteric neurons. This paper reviews recent advances in our
understanding of neural crest cell induction and migration, emphasizing both
avian and amphibian models. Cell facts: The embryonic progenitors of pigment
cells, the neurons and glia of the peripheral nervous system, as well as
connective tissue in the face, neck and heart. Induced to form at the boundary of
the neuroepithelium and embryonic ectoderm. Expression of the transcription
factors Snail, Slug and FoxD3 leads to delamination from the neural tube.
Invasive motility not unlike that of tumor cells can be studied in vitro. Express
proteases, distinctive cell surface receptors and glycoproteins to acquire an
invasive phenotype. Mutations of transcription factors expressed by the neural
crest or in other factors that inhibit their premature differentiation can lead
to survival and migration-associated birth defects.

Regulation of Msx genes by a Bmp gradient is essential for neural crest
specification.

Tribulo C(1), Aybar MJ, Nguyen VH, Mullins MC, Mayor R.

Author information: 
(1)Millennium Nucleus in Developmental Biology, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad
de Chile, Casilla 653, Santiago, Chile.

There is evidence in Xenopus and zebrafish embryos that the neural crest/neural
folds are specified at the border of the neural plate by a precise threshold
concentration of a Bmp gradient. In order to understand the molecular mechanism
by which a gradient of Bmp is able to specify the neural crest, we analyzed how
the expression of Bmp targets, the Msx genes, is regulated and the role that Msx 
genes has in neural crest specification. As Msx genes are directly downstream of 
Bmp, we analyzed Msx gene expression after experimental modification in the level
of Bmp activity by grafting a bead soaked with noggin into Xenopus embryos, by
expressing in the ectoderm a dominant-negative Bmp4 or Bmp receptor in Xenopus
and zebrafish embryos, and also through Bmp pathway component mutants in the
zebrafish. All the results show that a reduction in the level of Bmp activity
leads to an increase in the expression of Msx genes in the neural plate border.
Interestingly, by reaching different levels of Bmp activity in animal cap
ectoderm, we show that a specific concentration of Bmp induces msx1 expression to
a level similar to that required to induce neural crest. Our results indicate
that an intermediate level of Bmp activity specifies the expression of Msx genes 
in the neural fold region. In addition, we have analyzed the role that msx1 plays
on neural crest specification. As msx1 has a role in dorsoventral pattering, we
have carried out conditional gain- and loss-of-function experiments using
different msx1 constructs fused to a glucocorticoid receptor element to avoid an 
early effect of this factor. We show that msx1 expression is able to induce all
other early neural crest markers tested (snail, slug, foxd3) at the time of
neural crest specification. Furthermore, the expression of a dominant negative of
Msx genes leads to the inhibition of all the neural crest markers analyzed. It
has been previously shown that snail is one of the earliest genes acting in the
neural crest genetic cascade. In order to study the hierarchical relationship
between msx1 and snail/slug we performed several rescue experiments using
dominant negatives for these genes. The rescuing activity by snail and slug on
neural crest development of the msx1 dominant negative, together with the
inability of msx1 to rescue the dominant negatives of slug and snail strongly
argue that msx1 is upstream of snail and slug in the genetic cascade that
specifies the neural crest in the ectoderm. We propose a model where a gradient
of Bmp activity specifies the expression of Msx genes in the neural folds, and
that this expression is essential for the early specification of the neural
crest.

Sox10 is required for the early development of the prospective neural crest in
Xenopus embryos.

Honoré SM(1), Aybar MJ, Mayor R.

Author information: 
(1)Millennium Nucleus in Developmental Biology, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad
de Chile, Casilla 653, Santiago, Chile.

The Sox family of transcription factors has been implicated in the development of
different tissues during embryogenesis. Several mutations in humans, mice, and
zebrafish have shown that depletion of Sox10 activity produces defects in the
development of neural crest derivatives, such as melanocytes, ganglia of the
peripheral nervous system, and some specific cell types as glia. We have isolated
the Xenopus homologue of the Sox10 gene. It is expressed in prospective neural
crest and otic placode regions from the earliest stages of neural crest
specification and in migrating cranial and trunk neural crest cells.
Loss-of-function experiments using morpholino antisense oligos against Sox10
produce a loss of neural crest precursors and an enlargement of the surrounding
neural plate and epidermis. This effect of Sox10 depletion is produced during
some of the earliest steps of neural crest specification, as is shown by the
inhibition in the expression of Slug and FoxD3, which are early markers of neural
crest specification. In addition, we show that Sox10 depletion leads to an
increase in apoptosis and a decrease in cell proliferation in the neural folds,
suggesting that Sox10 could work as a survival as well as a specification factor 
in neural crest precursors during premigratory stages. Although some of the
deficiencies found in the Waardenburg syndrome and in the Hirschprung disease
could be associated with a failure of the development of crest derivatives during
the late phase of its development, or even during adulthood, our results suggest 
that inhibition of Sox10 activity produces an earlier failure of neural crest
precursors. In experiments where melanocytes and ganglia were induced in vivo and
in vitro, we were able to block their development by inhibiting Sox10 activity.
These results are compatible with an additional late role of Sox10 on development
of neural crest derivatives, as it has been previously proposed. We show that
Sox10 expression is dependent on FGF and Wnt activity, both in the neural crest
and in the otic placode territories. Finally, in order to establish the position 
of Sox10 in the hierarchical cascade of gene activation required for neural crest
specification, we used inducible forms of the wild type and dominant negatives
for the Snail and Slug genes. Our results show that Snail is able to control
Sox10 expression. However, the overexpression of Slug was not able to upregulate 
Sox10 expression. Taken together, these results indicate that Sox10 may lie
between Snail and Slug in the genetic cascade that controls neural crest
development.

At the border of the neural plate, the induction of the neural crest can be
achieved by interactions with the epidermis, or with the underlying mesoderm. Wnt
signals are required for the inducing activity of the epidermis in chick and
amphibian embryos. Here, we analyze the molecular mechanisms of neural crest
induction by the mesoderm in Xenopus embryos. Using a recombination assay, we
show that prospective paraxial mesoderm induces a panel of neural crest markers
(Slug, FoxD3, Zic5 and Sox9), whereas the future axial mesoderm only induces a
subset of these genes. This induction is blocked by a dominant negative (dn) form
of FGFR1. However, neither dnFGFR4a nor inhibition of Wnt signaling prevents
neural crest induction in this system. Among the FGFs, FGF8 is strongly expressed
by the paraxial mesoderm. FGF8 is sufficient to induce the neural crest markers
FoxD3, Sox9 and Zic5 transiently in the animal cap assay. In vivo, FGF8
injections also expand the Slug expression domain. This suggests that FGF8 can
initiate neural crest formation and cooperates with other DLMZ-derived factors to
maintain and complete neural crest induction. In contrast to Wnts, eFGF or bFGF, 
FGF8 elicits neural crest induction in the absence of mesoderm induction and
without a requirement for BMP antagonists. In vivo, it is difficult to dissociate
the roles of FGF and WNT factors in mesoderm induction and neural patterning. We 
show that, in most cases, effects on neural crest formation were parallel to
altered mesoderm or neural development. However, neural and neural crest
patterning can be dissociated experimentally using different dominant-negative
manipulations: while Nfz8 blocks both posterior neural plate formation and neural
crest formation, dnFGFR4a blocks neural patterning without blocking neural crest 
formation. These results suggest that different signal transduction mechanisms
may be used in neural crest induction, and anteroposterior neural patterning.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) binds to its receptor PTH1R (parathyroid hormone 1
receptor) in osteoblastic cells to regulate bone remodeling and calcium
homeostasis. While prolonged exposure to PTH causes increased bone resorption,
intermittent injections of PTH have an anabolic effect on bone. The molecular
mechanisms regulating these processes are still largely unknown. Here, we present
our results on gene expression profile changes in the PTH-treated osteoblastic
cell line, UMR 106-01, using DNA microarray analysis. A total of 125 known genes 
and 30 unknown expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were found to have at least 2-fold 
expression changes after PTH treatment at 4, 12, and 24 h. 14 genes were
previously known to be PTH-regulated but many were unknown to be regulated by PTH
prior to our experiments. Real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR confirmed that 90
and 50% of the genes are regulated more than 2-fold by PTH in UMR 106-01 and rat 
primary osteoblastic cells, respectively. Most genes belong to the following
protein families: hormones, growth factors, and receptors; signal transduction
pathway proteins; transcription factors; proteases; metabolic enzymes; structural
and matrix proteins; transporters; etc. These results provide a comprehensive and
deeper knowledge about PTH regulation of osteoblastic gene expression. Next, we
designed a computational method to extract information about transcription
factors likely involved in regulating these genes. These factors include those
previously known to be involved in PTH signaling (AP-1 and the cAMP response
element-binding protein), those that were identified by microarray data (C/EBP), 
and some novel transcription factors (AP-2, AP-4, SP1, FoxD3, etc.). Our results 
suggest that a reliable bioinformatics approach can be easily applied for other
systems.

Multipotentiality of neuronal cells after spontaneous fusion with embryonic stem 
cells and nuclear reprogramming in vitro.

Primary mouse brain cells were cultured with HPRT (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl
transferase)-deficient ES (embryonic stem) cells to see if the ES cells could
provide cues sufficient to reprogram a pluripotential state. After 5 days of
coculture, HPRT-deficient ES cells were killed by selection in HAT (hypoxanthine,
aminopterin, thymidine) medium. We observed islands of HAT-resistant ES-like
cells surrounded by differentiated cells. Cell lines generated from three such
"islands" proved to be spontaneous, pluripotential ES-neural hybrids, and gave
rise to a chimera following blastocyst injection. Re-expression of the
ES-specific gene Foxd3 from somatic-derived chromosomes suggested that the
somatic nucleus had been reprogrammed. Our results raise the intriguing
possibility that ASCs shown to contribute to multiple tissues in
blastocyst-injection studies may not contribute as a result of pluripotency.
Instead contributions may arise from spontaneous fusion events in which phenotype
is determined by either cytoplasmic dominance, nuclear reprogramming, or both.

PURPOSE: Analysis of patients with late relapse (LR) of germ cell tumor (GCT)
with reports on clinical characteristics, outcomes, and molecular and cytogenetic
features.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-three patients evaluated at Indiana University from 
1993 through 2000 for relapse of GCT more than 2 years from initial therapy were 
reviewed. Available specimens were investigated for expression of the
transcription regulator FoxD3 and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease and the
presence of chromosome 12 abnormalities.
RESULTS: Median interval from initial presentation to LR was 85 months.
Forty-three of 49 LR patients who underwent surgery were rendered disease free
(NED), and 20 (46.5%) remain continuously NED. Thirty-two patients received
chemotherapy, but only six (18.8%) obtained a complete remission. Five of these
patients remain continuously NED after chemotherapy alone, including three who
were chemotherapy naïve. Eighteen of these 32 patients were successfully rendered
NED by postchemotherapy surgery, and 12 remain continuously NED. Two patients
continue on observation with no treatment for their LR. Overall, 69 of the 81
treated patients (85.2%) ultimately achieved an NED state, and 38 (46.9%) remain 
continuously NED with median follow-up from LR therapy of 24.5 months (range, 1
to 83 months), whereas nine other patients are currently NED after therapy for
subsequent relapses. Because of the small numbers of specimens tested, we were
unable to draw any definitive conclusions from the molecular and cytogenetic
analyses.
CONCLUSION: GCT patients require lifetime follow-up. At the time of LR, surgical 
resection alone remains our preferred therapy.

Snail precedes slug in the genetic cascade required for the specification and
migration of the Xenopus neural crest.

Aybar MJ(1), Nieto MA, Mayor R.

(1)Millennium Nucleus in Developmental Biology, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad
de Chile, Casilla 653, Santiago, Chile.

The complex sequence of inductive events responsible for the generation of the
neural crest at the border between the neural plate and the epidermis, triggers a
genetic cascade involving several families of transcription factors. Two members 
of the Snail family, Snail and Slug, have both been implicated in this cascade.
In chick and Xenopus, loss- and gain-of-function experiments have provided
evidence that Slug plays a key role in neural crest development. However, in
contrast to the chick, Snail rather than Slug is expressed in the premigratory
neural crest in the mouse and, in Xenopus, Snail precedes Slug expression in this
population. Thus, in order to study the function of Snail in neural crest
development in Xenopus, we have carried out conditional gain- and
loss-of-function experiments using different Snail constructs fused to a
glucocorticoid receptor element. We show that Snail is able to induce the
expression of Slug and all other neural crest markers tested (Zic5, FoxD3, Twist 
and Ets1) at the time of specification. This activation is observed in whole
embryos and in animal caps, in the absence of neural plate and mesodermal
markers. We show that Snail is required for neural crest specification and
migration and that it works as a transcriptional repressor. These functions have 
been previously attributed to SLUG: However, Slug alone is unable to induce other
neural crest markers in animal cap assays, and we show that Snail and Slug can be
functionally equivalent when tested in overexpression studies. This suggests
that, in Xenopus embryos, at least some of the functions previously attributed to
Slug can be carried out by SNAIL: This is additionally supported by rescue
experiments in embryos injected with dominant-negative constructs that indicate
that Snail lies upstream of Slug in the genetic cascade leading to neural crest
formation and that it plays a key role in crest development.

An amphioxus winged helix/forkhead gene, AmphiFoxD: insights into vertebrate
neural crest evolution.

During amphioxus development, the neural plate is bordered by cells expressing
many genes with homologs involved in vertebrate neural crest induction. However, 
these amphioxus cells evidently lack additional genetic programs for the cell
delaminations, migrations, and differentiations characterizing definitive
vertebrate neural crest. We characterize an amphioxus winged helix/forkhead gene 
(AmphiFoxD) closely related to vertebrate FoxD genes. Phylogenetic analysis
indicates that the AmphiFoxD is basal to vertebrate FoxD1, FoxD2, FoxD3, FoxD4,
and FoxD5. One of these vertebrate genes (FoxD3) consistently marks neural crest 
during development. Early in amphioxus development, AmphiFoxD is expressed
medially in the anterior neural plate as well as in axial (notochordal) and
paraxial mesoderm; later, the gene is expressed in the somites, notochord,
cerebral vesicle (diencephalon), and hindgut endoderm. However, there is never
any expression in cells bordering the neural plate. We speculate that an
AmphiFoxD homolog in the common ancestor of amphioxus and vertebrates was
involved in histogenic processes in the mesoderm (evagination and delamination of
the somites and notochord); then, in the early vertebrates, descendant paralogs
of this gene began functioning in the presumptive neural crest bordering the
neural plate to help make possible the delaminations and cell migrations that
characterize definitive vertebrate neural crest.

Critical to our understanding of the developmental potential of stem cells and
subsequent control of their differentiation in vitro and in vivo is a thorough
understanding of the genes that control stem cell fate. Here, we report that
Foxd3, a member of the forkhead family of transcriptional regulators, is required
for maintenance of embryonic cells of the early mouse embryo. Foxd3-/- embryos
die after implantation at approximately 6.5 days postcoitum with a loss of
epiblast cells, expansion of proximal extraembryonic tissues, and a distal,
mislocalized anterior organizing center. Moreover, it has not been possible to
establish Foxd3-/- ES cell lines or to generate Foxd3-/- teratocarcinomas.
Chimera analysis reveals that Foxd3 function is required in the epiblast and that
Foxd3-/- embryos can be rescued by a small number of wild-type cells. Foxd3-/-
mutant blastocysts appear morphologically normal and express Oct4, Sox2, and
Fgf4, but when placed in vitro the inner cell mass initially proliferates and
then fails to expand even when Fgf4 is added. These results establish Foxd3 as a 
factor required for the maintenance of progenitor cells in the mammalian embryo.

The POU homeodomain protein Oct-4 and the Forkhead Box protein FoxD3 (previously 
Genesis) are transcriptional regulators expressed in embryonic stem cells.
Down-regulation of Oct-4 during gastrulation is essential for proper endoderm
development. After gastrulation, FoxD3 is generally down-regulated during early
endoderm formation, although it specifically remains expressed in the embryonic
neural crest. In these studies, we have found that Oct-4 and FoxD3 can bind to
identical regulatory DNA sequences. In addition, Oct-4 physically interacted with
the FoxD3 DNA-binding domain. Cotransfection of Oct-4 and FoxD3 expression
vectors activated the osteopontin enhancer, which is expressed in totipotent
embryonic stem cells. FoxA1 and FoxA2 (previously HNF-3alpha and HNF-3beta) are
Forkhead Box transcription factors that participate in liver and lung formation
from foregut endoderm. Although FoxD3 activated the FoxA1 and FoxA2 promoters,
Oct-4 inhibited FoxD3 activation of the FoxA1 and FoxA2 endodermal promoters.
These data indicate that Oct-4 functions as a corepressor of FoxD3 to provide
embryonic lineage-specific transcriptional regulatory activity to maintain
appropriate developmental timing.

The hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF-3)/fork head (fkh) family contains a large
number of transcription factors that recognize divergent DNA sequences via a
winged helix binding motif. HNF-3/fkh proteins show a broad profile of DNA
sequence-specificity in which one DNA sequence can be recognized by more than one
HNF-3/fkh protein and each individual HNF-3/fkh protein has several DNA binding
sequences. In this study, heteronuclear NMR methods were used to study the
structures of the DNA binding domain of a conserved winged helix protein HFH-1
and its DNA complexes. The structural comparison of winged helix proteins HFH-1
and Genesis and their DNA complexes indicates that even two highly conserved
HNF-3 family members can adopt different local structures when they contact an
identical DNA binding sequence, while one of these two HNF-3 proteins seems to
adopt only slightly different structures on different DNA binding sites.

The winged-helix transcription factor Foxd3 suppresses interneuron
differentiation and promotes neural crest cell fate.

Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.

The neural crest is a migratory cell population that gives rise to multiple cell 
types in the vertebrate embryo. The intrinsic determinants that segregate neural 
crest cells from multipotential dorsal progenitors within the neural tube are
poorly defined. In this study, we show that the winged helix transcription factor
Foxd3 is expressed in both premigratory and migratory neural crest cells. Foxd3
is genetically downstream of Pax3 and is not expressed in regions of Pax3 mutant 
mice that lack neural crest, implying that Foxd3 may regulate aspects of the
neural crest differentiation program. We show that misexpression of Foxd3 in the 
chick neural tube promotes a neural crest-like phenotype and suppresses
interneuron differentiation. Cells that ectopically express Foxd3 upregulate HNK1
and Cad7, delaminate and emigrate from the neural tube at multiple dorsoventral
levels. Foxd3 does not induce Slug and RhoB, nor is its ability to promote a
neural crest-like phenotype enhanced by co-expression of Slug. Together these
results suggest Foxd3 can function independently of Slug and RhoB to promote the 
development of neural crest cells from neural tube progenitors.

Foxl1 controls the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway by modulating the expression of
proteoglycans in the gut.

Perreault N(1), Katz JP, Sackett SD, Kaestner KH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine,

Foxl1 is a winged helix transcription factor expressed in the mesenchyme of the
gastrointestinal tract. Foxl1 null mice display severe structural defects in the 
epithelia of the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum. Here we addressed the molecular 
mechanisms by which Foxl1 controls gastrointestinal differentiation. First we
showed that the abnormalities found in the epithelia of the null mice are the
result of an increase in the number of proliferating cells and not a change in
the rate of cell migration. Next we investigated the regulatory circuits affected
by Foxl1. We focused on the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway as a possible
target of Foxl1 as it has been shown to play a central role in gastrointestinal
proliferation. We demonstrated that Foxl1 activates the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway 
by increasing extracellular proteoglycans, which act as co-receptors for Wnt.
Thus we establish that Foxl1 is involved in the regulation of the
Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, providing a novel link in mesenchymal/epithelial
cross-talk in the gut. Moreover, we provide the first example implicating
proteoglycans in the regulation of cellular proliferation in the gastrointestinal
tract.

Requirement of FoxD3-class signaling for neural crest determination in Xenopus.

(1)Department of Medical Embryology and Neurobiology, and. Department of
Molecular and Cellular Biology, Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences, Kyoto
University, Sakyo, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.

Fox factors (winged-helix transcription factors) play important roles in early
embryonic patterning. We show here that FoxD3 (Forkhead 6) regulates neural crest
determination in Xenopus embryos. Expression of FoxD3 in the presumptive neural
crest region starts at the late gastrula stage in a manner similar to that of
Slug, and overlaps with that of Zic-r1. When overexpressed in the embryo and in
ectodermal explants, FoxD3 induces expression of neural crest markers.
Attenuation of FoxD3-related signaling by a dominant-negative FoxD3 construct
(FoxD3delN) inhibits neural crest differentiation in vivo without suppressing the
CNS marker Sox2. Interestingly, these loss-of-function phenotypes are reversed by
coinjecting SLUG: In animal cap explants, neural crest differentiation induced by
Slug and Wnt3a is also inhibited by FoxD3delN but not by a dominant-negative form
of XBF2. Loss-of-function studies using dominant-negative forms of FoxD3 and Slug
indicate that Slug induction by Zic factors requires FoxD3-related signaling, and
that FoxD3 and Slug have different requirements in inducing downstream neural
crest markers. These data demonstrate that FoxD3 (or its closely related factor) 
is an essential upstream regulator of neural crest determination.

Overexpression of the transcriptional repressor FoxD3 prevents neural crest
formation in Xenopus embryos.

Pohl BS(1), Knöchel W.

Author information: 
(1)Abteilung Biochemie, Universität Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, D-89081 Ulm,
Germany.

Xenopus FoxD3 (XFD-6) is an intron-less gene initially expressed within the
Spemann organizer and later in premigratory neural crest cells. Based upon
sequence and expression pattern comparisons, it represents the Xenopus orthologue
to zebrafish fkd6, chicken CWH-3 and mammalian HFH-2 (genesis). Early expression 
of FoxD3 is activated by the Wnt-pathway and inhibited by BMP signalling. Ectopic
overexpression of FoxD3 leads to an enlargement of the neural plate concomitant
with a failure in neural crest formation, loss of anterior structures, lack of
closure of the neural tube and severe defects in somitogenesis. Phenotypic
variation is accompanied by down-regulation of neural crest markers, including
Xslug, Xtwist and Xcadherin-11. FoxD3 also inhibits its own expression, thereby
acting in a negative autoregulatory loop. By injections of VP16 and engrailed
fusions we can demonstrate that FoxD3 acts as a negative transcriptional
regulator; this repressive function strictly requires the presence of the winged 
helix domain. Transplantation experiments show that FoxD3 overexpressing cells
from the prospective neural crest do neither differentiate nor migrate.

The winged-helix transcription factor FoxD3 is important for establishing the
neural crest lineage and repressing melanogenesis in avian embryos.

Author information: 
(1)Section of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of California-Davis,
Davis, CA 95616, USA.

The winged-helix or forkhead class of transcription factors has been shown to
play important roles in cell specification and lineage segregation. We have
cloned the chicken homolog of FoxD3, a member of the winged-helix class of
transcription factors, and analyzed its expression. Based on its expression in
the dorsal neural tube and in all neural crest lineages except the
late-emigrating melanoblasts, we predicted that FoxD3 might be important in the
segregation of the neural crest lineage from the neural epithelium, and for
repressing melanogenesis in early-migrating neural crest cells. Misexpression of 
FoxD3 by electroporation in the lateral neural epithelium early in neural crest
development produced an expansion of HNK1 immunoreactivity throughout the neural 
epithelium, although these cells did not undergo an epithelial/mesenchymal
transformation. To test whether FoxD3 represses melanogenesis in early migrating 
neural crest cells, we knocked down expression in cultured neural crest with
antisense oligonucleotides and in vivo by treatment with morpholino antisense
oligonucleotides. Both experimental approaches resulted in an expansion of the
melanoblast lineage, probably at the expense of neuronal and glial lineages.
Conversely, persistent expression of FoxD3 in late-migrating neural crest cells
using RCAS viruses resulted in the failure of melanoblasts to develop. We suggest
that FoxD3 plays two important roles in neural crest development. First, it is
involved in the segregation of the neural crest lineage from the neuroepithelium.
Second, it represses melanogenesis, thereby allowing other neural crest
derivatives to differentiate during the early stages of neural crest patterning.

The forkhead transcription factor UNC-130 is required for the graded spatial
expression of the UNC-129 TGF-beta guidance factor in C. elegans.

Secreted proteins required for cellular movements along the circumference of the 
body wall in Caenorhabditis elegans include UNC-6/netrin and the novel TGF-beta
UNC-129. Expression of these proteins is graded along the dorsoventral (D/V)
axis, providing polarity information to guide migrations. Here we show that the
graded expression of UNC-129 in dorsal but not ventral body muscles depends on
unc-130, which encodes a Forkhead transcription factor. The phenotype of unc-130 
mutants closely mimics the reported effects of ectopically expressing unc-129 in 
both dorsal and ventral body muscles (). This fits our present finding that
unc-130 cell autonomously represses unc-129 expression in the ventral body
muscles. Thus the cell-specific effects of unc-130 on ventral, but not dorsal,
body muscle expression of unc-129 accounts for the D/V polarity information
required for UNC-129-mediated guidance. Genetic interactions between unc-130 and 
other guidance genes show that several molecular pathways function in parallel to
guide the ventral to dorsal migration of distal tip cells (DTCs) and axonal
growth cones in C. elegans. Genetic interactions confirm that UNC-129 does not
require the only known type II TGF-beta receptor in C. elegans (DAF-4) for its
guidance functions. Also, unc-130 is partially required for male tail
morphogenesis and for embryogenesis.

The olfactory placodes of the zebrafish form by convergence of cellular fields at
the edge of the neural plate.

Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA. kew13@cornell.edu

The primary olfactory sensory system is part of the PNS that develops from
ectodermal placodes. Several cell types, including sensory neurons and support
cells, differentiate within the olfactory placode to form the mature olfactory
organ. The olfactory placodes are thought to arise from lateral regions of the
anterior neural plate, which separate from the plate through differential cell
movements. We determined the origins of the olfactory placodes in zebrafish by
labeling cells along the anterior-lateral edge of the neural plate at times
preceding the formation of the olfactory placodes and examining the later fates
of the labeled cells. Surprisingly, we found that the olfactory placode arises
from a field of cells, not from a discrete region of the anterior neural plate.
This field extends posteriorly to the anterior limits of cranial neural crest and
is bordered medially by telencephalic precursors. Cells giving rise to progeny in
both the olfactory organ and telencephalon express the distal-less 3 gene.
Furthermore, we found no localized pockets of cell division in the
anterior-lateral neural plate cells preceding the appearance of the olfactory
placode. We suggest that the olfactory placodes arise by anterior convergence of 
a field of lateral neural plate cells, rather than by localized separation and
proliferation of a discrete group of cells.

bssmk@bath.ac.uk

The zebrafish fkd6 gene is a marker for premigratory neural crest. In this study,
we analyze later expression in putative glia of the peripheral nervous system.
Prior to neural crest migration, fkd6 expression is downregulated in crest cells.
Subsequently, expression appears initially in loose clusters of cells in
positions corresponding to cranial ganglia. Double labelling with a neuronal
marker shows that fkd6-expressing cells are not differentiated neurones and
generally lie peripheral to neurones in ganglia. Later, expression appears
associated with the posterior lateral line and other cranial nerves. For the
posterior lateral line nerve, we show that fkd6-labeling extends caudally along
this nerve in tight correlation with lateral line primordium migration and axon
elongation. Expression in colourless mutant embryos is consistent with these
cells being satellite glia and Schwann cells.

The dynamic properties of a winged helix protein, Genesis, and its DNA complex at
different temperatures were studied. Due to the complexity of motions, the
commonly used model-free formalism could not be used to reflect the dynamic
properties. The reduced spectral density function mapping approach was proven to 
be a useful tool to describe the overall and internal motion of molecules on the 
picosecond to nanosecond time-scale, and conformational exchanges on the
microsecond to millisecond time-scale. The local motions in DNA-free Genesis
showed strong temperature dependence and the backbone dynamics of each secondary 
structural element responds to the temperature change differently, while the
Genesis-DNA complex showed more stability with changing the temperatures.
Furthermore, each DNA contact sequence of Genesis showed distinct dynamic
perturbation after Genesis binds to DNA.

development model.

A novel repressor of the Winged Helix (formerly HNF-3/Forkhead) transcriptional
regulatory family, termed Genesis (also called HFH2), was previously found to be 
exclusively expressed in primitive embryonic cell lines. In this study in situ
cRNA hybridization experiments revealed that Genesis was expressed during
embryogenesis only in developing neural crest cells. Its expression diminished
upon their terminal differentiation into sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons.
Based on that finding, Genesis was retrovirally transduced into pluripotent
N-Tera-2 clone D1 (NT2/D1) teratocarcinoma cells, which are a well-described in
vitro model of neural development. Retinoic acid (RA) treatment will drive these 
cells to differentiation toward the neuronal lineage and cause an increase in
expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 protein, which leads to
an inhibition in cellular proliferation. Although RA-induced expression of
neuronal differentiation markers was not influenced by forced overexpression of
Genesis in NT2-D1 cells, proliferation of Genesis-transduced cells continued
following RA treatment. RA was unable to induce the expression of the
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 in the Genesis-transduced cells, but Go/G1 
tumor suppressor p53 expression was induced normally. Therefore, Genesis may play
a role in the regulation of primitive neural crest development by preventing
terminal quiescence through inhibition of p21 protein expression. These data also
lend evidence for the hypothesis that proliferation and differentiation pathways 
are not irrevocably linked, but can function independently.

Genesis is an HNF-3/fkh homologous protein. By using multi-dimensional NMR
techniques, we have obtained the solution structure and backbone dynamics of
Genesis complexed with a 17 base-pair DNA. Our results indicate that both the
local folding and dynamic properties of Genesis are perturbed when it binds to
the DNA site. Our data show that a conserved flexible amino acid sequence (wing
1) makes dynamic contacts to DNA in the complex and a short helix is induced by
Genesis-DNA interactions. Our data indicate that, unlike the HNF-3gamma/DNA
complex, a magnesium ion is not required in forming the stable Genesis-DNA
complex.

The dissociation rate of a winged helix protein-DNA complex is influenced by
non-DNA contact residues.

University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, 60612, USA.

The dissociation constants and the half-lives of the DNA complexes of winged
helix protein Genesis and its mutants were investigated. Our data show that
substitutions of non-DNA contact residues in the two highly dynamic wing
sequences dramatically change the off rates of the complexes. Thus, our data
indicate that the off rate of a DNA complex is encoded in the amino acid sequence
of the DNA-binding protein and/or should be a unique property for a protein-DNA
complex. Our data also indicate that the local structural transition of a
DNA-binding protein in its DNA recognition process is likely to go through a
transition state, which can control the on and off rates of a complex.

We have cloned and sequenced 1398bp of the rat HFE gene promoter region. The
alignment of the rat promoter HFE sequence with the HFE promoter sequence from
human and mouse detected several highly conserved sequences present at
orthologous or heterologous positions in the three species. Subsequent analysis
of the conserved promoter sequences identified the presence of 10 novel
transcription elements present in the promoter regions of the human, mouse and
rat HFE genes (GATA, NF-IL6, AP1, AP2, CREB, PEA3, gamma-IRE, GFI1, HNF-3beta,
HFH2). Different gel retardation analyses performed with rat-liver nuclear
extracts have confirmed the presence of factors binding to some of these
transcription elements. This represents the first data concerning the
identification of potential transcriptional elements of the HFE promoter in these
three species. The expression pattern of the transcription factors corresponding 
to the novel elements identified in the HFE promoter is consistent with the
potential role of the HFE promoter in the transcription regulation and function
of the HFE gene. Knowledge of the identified conserved elements in the HFE
promoter from human, mouse and rat provides the basis for subsequent in-vitro or 
in-vivo studies leading to identification of the detailed mechanisms involved in 
the regulation of the iron metabolism and the design of potential future
alternative therapies.

The embryonic neural crest is a unique group of cells that gives rise to the
peripheral nervous system as well as many other cell types. Most of the work
describing the behavior and specification of these cells has been done in the
avian system, a system amenable to experimental manipulations such as tissue
grafting, cell transplantation and lineage tracing. This work has been greatly
facilitated by the use of molecular markers of neural crest cells such as HNK-1
and slug, markers that are not yet available for the study of mouse neural crest.
Here we demonstrate that Hfh2 (HNF3 forkhead homologue 2), a member of the
'winged helix' or 'forkhead' transcription factor gene family, is expressed in
premigratory and migrating neural crest cells in the early mouse embryo and in
motorneuron progenitors in the developing spinal cord. Using linkage analysis we 
have localized the Hfh2 gene to chromosome 4 at 44.91 cM from the centromere.

Structural changes in the region directly adjacent to the DNA-binding helix
highlight a possible mechanism to explain the observed changes in the
sequence-specific binding of winged helix proteins.

The hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF-3)/fork head (fkh) family contains a large
number of transcription factors and folds into a winged helix motif. Despite
having almost invariable amino acid sequences in their principal DNA-binding
helices, HNF-3/fkh proteins show a wide diversity of sequence-specific binding.
Previous studies of chimeric HNF-3/fkh proteins demonstrated that the binding
specificity is primarily influenced by a region directly adjacent to the binding 
helix. We report our findings of an NMR structural study performed on an
HNF-3/fkh family member (Genesis, formerly HFH-2) and compare it to that of
another family member (HNF-3gamma) complexed to DNA and determined by X-ray
crystallography. It is found that in comparison to HNF-3gamma, Genesis contains
an extra small helix directly prior to the N terminus of the primary DNA contact 
helix. Due to the insertion of this helix, a shorter and slightly re-positioned
primary DNA contact helix is observed, which we believe leads to the DNA-binding 
specificity differences among family members.

Sequence specific collective motions in a winged helix DNA binding domain

The recognition between transcription factors and their DNA binding sites is a
highly dynamic process. During transcriptional regulation, transcription factors 
must bind to or dissociate from their cognate DNA binding sites. The winged helix
DNA binding motif is one of many highly conserved DNA binding motifs identified
in transcription factors. Backbone dynamics has been studied on the 15N- and
2H-enriched winged helix family member Genesis. Our data show that the overall
motions of the single domain Genesis are better described by more than two
autocorrelation times (taum). Our data also demonstrate that Genesis shows
structure specific conformation exchange characterized by Rex. Therefore, our
results indicate that the structure of Genesis is highly dynamic and that
secondary structure elements in Genesis have collective motions in the nanosecond
to millisecond time scale. Since the winged helix DNA binding motif is highly
conserved, this unique dynamic property observed in Genesis is also likely to be 
conserved in other winged helix family members and important in DNA binding.

Evidence that the DNA binding specificity of winged helix proteins is mediated by
a structural change in the amino acid sequence adjacent to the principal DNA
binding helix.

Street, Chicago, Illinois 60612, USA.

We present the first structural evidence supporting the hypothesis that the
binding specificity of the winged helix DNA binding motif is mediated by residues
adjacent to the alpha-helix (H3), the moiety which is primarily involved in the
interaction with DNA. Using NMR to determine secondary structural elements of a
winged helix family member, Genesis (formerly HFH-2), and comparing these with
those found in the X-ray crystal structure of the HNF-3gamma/DNA complex [Clark, 
K. L., Halay, E. D., Lai, E., & Burley, S. K. (1993) Nature 364, 412-420], we
show that the major differences observed occur for H3 and the region immediately 
prior to this. H3 in Genesis is slightly shorter than in HNF-3gamma and, in
addition, we observe an extra small helix (H4) in the region between H2 and H3
which is not found in the HNF-3gamma/DNA complex. This is significant as it has
been shown previously [Overdier, D. G., Porcella, A., & Costa R. H. (1994) Mol.
Cell. Biol. 14, 2755-2766] that the DNA-binding specificity is influenced by
amino acid residues in this region.

Different DNA contact schemes are used by two winged helix proteins to recognize

The hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF-3)/fork head (fkh) family contains a large
number of transcription factors which recognize divergent DNA sequences via a
winged-helix binding motif. In this report we present studies on the DNA binding 
properties of winged-helix HNF-3/fkh homologues 1 (HFH-1) and 2 (HFH-2) which
recognize a shared DNA binding site with different affinities. To explore how
HFH-1 and HFH-2 proteins recognize this DNA binding sequence, the binding
affinities of these two HFH proteins toward a series of DNA sites containing a
single strand trimer loop insertion at different positions were studied. This
insertion induces a bend of approximately 80 degrees in the DNA binding site
(prebending). HFH-1 and HFH-2 were shown to recognize DNA sites prebent at many
nucleotide positions on both strands of the DNA sequence. Both HFH-1 and HFH-2
were more sensitive to mismatch insertions on the sense strand of the DNA binding
site, especially within the AAAATAAC sequence. Our data suggest that the
recognition helix (helix 3) recognizes the AAAATAAC sequence and that the helix
3/DNA interaction results in bending of the DNA which narrows the major groove in
the AAAATAAC sequence. Furthermore, the binding affinities of HFH-1 and HFH-2
toward DNA binding sites with base-pair reversion in the AAAATAAC sequence was
also investigated. Different patterns of response from HFH-1 and HFH-2 to both
prebent and base-pair reverted binding sites was observed. Our results
demonstrate that even two highly conserved members of the winged-helix family may
contact the same DNA sequence differently.

A novel member of the winged helix (formerly HNF-3/Forkhead) transcriptional
regulatory family, termed Genesis, was isolated and characterized. Putative
translation of the complete cDNA revealed the winged helix DNA binding domain to 
be centrally located within the protein, with regions on either side that contain
known transcriptional regulatory motifs. Extensive Northern analysis of Genesis
found that the message was exclusively expressed in embryonic stem cells or their
malignant equivalent, embryonal carcinoma cells. The Genesis transcript was
down-regulated when these cells were stimulated to differentiate. DNA sequences
that Genesis protein would interact with were characterized and were found to
contain a consensus similar to that found in an embryonic stem cell enhancer
sequence. Co-transfection experiments revealed that Genesis is a transcriptional 
repressor. Genesis mapped to mouse chromosome 4 in a region syntenic with human
chromosome 1p31, a site of nonrandom abnormalities in germ cell neoplasia,
neuroblastoma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Genesis is a candidate for
regulating the phenotype of normal or malignant embryonic stem cells.
