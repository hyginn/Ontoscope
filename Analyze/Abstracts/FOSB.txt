Cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) is the largest and most
heterogeneous AML subgroup. It lacks sensitive and specific biomarkers. Emerging 
evidences have suggested that microRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of
various leukemias. This paper evaluated the association between microRNA
expression and prognostic outcome for CN-AML, based on the RNA/microRNA
sequencing data of CN-AML patients. High let-7a-2-3p expression and low
miR-188-5p expression were identified to be significantly associated with longer 
overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) for CN-AML, independently or 
in a combined way. Their prognostic values were further confirmed in European
Leukemia Net (ELN) genetic categories. Also, in multivariable analysis with other
known risk factors, high let-7a-2-3p and low miR-188-5p expression remained to be
associated with longer OS and EFS. In addition, the prognostic value of these two
microRNAs was confirmed in patients who received hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT). To gain more biological insights of the underlying
mechanisms, we derived the genome-wide differential gene/microRNA signatures
associated with the expression of let-7a-2-3p and miR-188-5p. Several common
microRNA signatures indicating favorable outcome in previous studies were
up-regulated in both high let-7a-2-3p expressers and low miR-188-5p expressers,
including miR-135a, miR-335 and miR-125b and all members of miR-181 family.
Additionally, common up-regulated genes included FOSB, IGJ, SNORD50A and ZNF502, 
and FOSB was a known favorable signature in AML. These common signatures further 
confirmed the underlying common mechanisms for these two microRNAs value as
favorable prognostic biomarkers. We concluded that high let-7a-2-3p and low
miR-188-5p expression could be potentially used as favorably prognostic
biomarkers independently or in a combined way in CN-AML patients, whether they
received HSCT or not.

In this study we determined whether methicillin-resistant non-Staphylococcus
aureus (MRNAS) from veal calves may be a potential reservoir of
antimicrobial-resistance and virulence genes. Fifty-eight MRNAS were studied by
means of DNA-microarray and PCR for detection of antimicrobial resistance and
virulence genes. The isolates carried a variety of antimicrobial-resistance genes
[aacA-aphD, aadD, aph3, aadE, sat, spc, ampA, erm(A), erm(B), erm(C), erm(F),
erm(T), lnu(A), msr(A)-msr(B), vga(A), mph(C), tet(K), tet(M), tet(L), cat, fexA,
dfrA, dfrD, dfrG, dfrK, cfr, fusB, fosB, qacA, qacC, merA-merB]. Some isolates
carried resistance genes without showing the corresponding resistance phenotype. 
Most MRNAS carried typical S.<U+2009>aureus virulence factors like proteases (sspP) and 
enterotoxins (seg) genes. Most Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates carried the
arginine catabolic element, and nearly 40% of the Staphylococcus sciuri isolates 
carried leukocidins, and/or fibronectin-binding protein genes. MRNAS were highly 
multi-resistant and represent an important reservoir of antimicrobial resistance 
and virulence genes.

Cyclic nucleotides (cAMP & cGMP) are critical intracellular second messengers
involved in the transduction of a diverse array of stimuli and their catabolism
is mediated by phosphodiesterases (PDEs). We previously detected focal genomic
amplification of PDE1C in >90 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells suggesting a
potential as a novel therapeutic target in these cells. In this report, we show
that genomic gain of PDE1C was associated with increased expression in low
passage GBM-derived cell cultures. We demonstrate that PDE1C is essential in
driving cell proliferation, migration and invasion in GBM cultures since
silencing of this gene significantly mitigates these functions. We also define
the mechanistic basis of this functional effect through whole genome expression
analysis by identifying down-stream gene effectors of PDE1C which are involved in
cell cycle and cell adhesion regulation. In addition, we also demonstrate that
Vinpocetine, a general PDE1 inhibitor, can also attenuate proliferation with no
effect on invasion/migration. Up-regulation of at least one of this gene set
(IL8, CXCL2, FOSB, NFE2L3, SUB1, SORBS2, WNT5A, and MMP1) in TCGA GBM cohorts is 
associated with worse outcome and PDE1C silencing down-regulated their
expression, thus also indicating potential to influence patient survival.
Therefore we conclude that proliferation, migration, and invasion of GBM cells
could also be regulated downstream of PDE1C. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

BACKGROUND: Preclinical and clinical data suggest that cannabidiol (CBD), a major
non-psychotomimetic compound from Cannabis sativa, induces antipsychotic-like
effects. However, the antipsychotic properties of repeated CBD treatment have
been poorly investigated. Behavioral changes induced by repeated treatment with
glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists have been proposed as
an animal model of schizophrenia-like signs. In the present study, we evaluated
if repeated treatment with CBD would attenuate the behavioral and molecular
modifications induced by chronic administration of one of these antagonists,
MK-801.
METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice received daily i.p. injections of MK-801 (0.1, 0.5,
or 1mg/kg) for 14, 21, or 28 days. Twenty-four hours after the last injection,
animals were submitted to the prepulse inhibition (PPI) test. After that, we
investigated if repeated treatment with CBD (15, 30, and 60mg/kg) would attenuate
the PPI impairment induced by chronic treatment with MK-801 (1mg/kg; 28 days).
CBD treatment began on the 6th day after the start of MK-801 administration and
continued until the end of the treatment. Immediately after the PPI, the mice
brains were removed and processed to evaluate the molecular changes. We measured 
changes in FosB/<U+0394>FosB and parvalbumin (PV) expression, a marker of neuronal
activity and a calcium-binding protein expressed in a subclass of GABAergic
interneurons, respectively. Changes in mRNA expression of the NMDAR GluN1 subunit
gene (GRN1) were also evaluated. CBD effects were compared to those induced by
the atypical antipsychotic clozapine.
RESULTS: MK-801 administration at the dose of 1mg/kg for 28 days impaired PPI
responses. Chronic treatment with CBD (30 and 60mg/kg) attenuated PPI impairment.
MK-801 treatment increased FosB/<U+0394>FosB expression and decreased PV expression in
the medial prefrontal cortex. A decreased mRNA level of GRN1 in the hippocampus
was also observed. All the molecular changes were attenuated by CBD. CBD by
itself did not induce any effect. Moreover, CBD effects were similar to those
induced by repeated clozapine treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that repeated treatment with CBD, similar to 
clozapine, reverses the psychotomimetic-like effects and attenuates molecular
changes observed after chronic administration of an NMDAR antagonist. These data 
support the view that CBD may have antipsychotic properties.

In Parkinson's disease, long-term dopamine replacement therapy is complicated by 
the appearance of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). One major hypothesis is that
LID results from an aberrant transcriptional program in striatal neurons induced 
by L-DOPA and triggered by the activation of ERK. To identify these genes, we
performed transcriptome analyses in the striatum in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned
mice. A time course analysis (0-6 h after treatment with L-DOPA) identified an
acute signature of 709 genes, among which genes involved in protein phosphatase
activity were overrepresented, suggesting a negative feedback on ERK activation
by l-DOPA. l-DOPA-dependent deregulation of 28 genes was blocked by pretreatment 
with SL327, an inhibitor of ERK activation, and 26 genes were found
differentially expressed between highly and weakly dyskinetic animals after
treatment with L-DOPA. The intersection list identified five genes: FosB, Th,
Nptx2, Nedd4l, and Ccrn4l. Nptx2 encodes neuronal pentraxin II (or neuronal
activity-regulated pentraxin, Narp), which is involved in the clustering of
glutamate receptors. We confirmed increased Nptx2 expression after L-DOPA and its
blockade by SL327 using quantitative RT-PCR in independent experiments. Using an 
escalating L-DOPA dose protocol, LID severity was decreased in Narp knock-out
mice compared with their wild-type littermates or after overexpression of a
dominant-negative form of Narp in the striatum. In conclusion, we have identified
a molecular signature induced by L-DOPA in the dopamine-denervated striatum that 
is dependent on ERK and associated with LID. Here, we demonstrate the implication
of one of these genes, Nptx2, in the development of LID.

Sleep apnea is associated with hypertension. The mechanisms contributing to a
sustained increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) even during normoxic
awake-state remain unknown. Rats exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia for 7
days, a model of the hypoxemia associated with sleep apnea, exhibit sustained
increases in MAP even during the normoxic dark phase. Activation of the
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in chronic intermittent
hypoxia (CIH) hypertension. Since the subfornical organ (SFO) serves as a primary
target for the central actions of circulating ANG II, we tested the effects of
ANG II type 1a receptor (AT1aR) knockdown in the SFO on the sustained increase in
MAP in this CIH model. Adeno-associated virus carrying green fluorescent protein 
(GFP) and small-hairpin RNA against either AT1aR or a scrambled control sequence 
(SCM) was stereotaxically injected in the SFO of rats. After recovery, MAP, heart
rate, respiratory rate, and activity were continuously recorded using
radiotelemetry. In the normoxic groups, the recorded variables did not deviate
from the baseline values. Both CIH groups exhibited significant increases in MAP 
during CIH exposures (P < 0.05). During the normoxic dark phase in the CIH
groups, only the SCM-injected group exhibited a sustained increase in MAP (P <
0.05). The AT1aR-CIH group showed significant decreases in FosB/<U+0394>FosB staining in
the median preoptic nucleus and the paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus
compared with the SCM-CIH group. Our data indicate that AT1aRs in the SFO are
critical for the sustained elevation in MAP and increased FosB/<U+0394>FosB expression
in forebrain autonomic nuclei associated with CIH.

The development and maintenance of cocaine addiction depend heavily on learned
reward-environment associations that can induce drug-seeking behavior and
relapse. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these cue-induced conditioned
responses is important for relapse prevention. To test whether intracellular
responses measured after cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP) expression
are context-dependent, we re-exposed cocaine-treated rats (drug-free) to an
environment previously paired with cocaine or saline, 24h after the CPP test.
After 8 days of cocaine CPP training with one of two cocaine doses (5mg/kg or
20mg/kg, i.p.), CPP was expressed only after conditioning with the higher cocaine
dose. In CPP expressing rats, locomotor responses after re-exposure to the
cocaine-chamber were greater than in rats re-exposed to the saline-paired
chamber. Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) phosphorylated ERK (pERK) levels were increased 
after re-exposure to the cocaine-paired, but not the saline-paired chamber,
regardless of whether or not CPP behavior was expressed. Caudate Putamen (CPu)
pERK and FosB protein levels increased after re-exposure to the cocaine chamber
only after conditioning with the higher cocaine dose. Conversely, the higher
cocaine dose, independent of environment, resulted in increased NAc FosB, <U+0394>FosB
and phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) protein levels compared to those conditioned with
5mg/kg cocaine (non-CPP-expressing). Our results suggest that NAc ERK
phosphorylation may be involved with retrieving the contextual information of a
cocaine-association, without necessarily motivating the expression of CPP
behavior. Additionally, we show distinct patterns of intracellular responses in
the NAc and CPu indicating a region-specific role for pERK/pCREB/FosB
intracellular signaling in the retrieval of cocaine-context associations.

Osteogenic differentiation and gene expression profile of human dental follicle
cells induced by human dental pulp cells.

Dental follicle cells (DFCs) differentiate into cementoblasts or osteoblasts
under appropriate triggering. However, the mechanism(s) for osteogenic
differentiation of DFCs are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to
examine the effects of dental papilla-derived human dental pulp cells (hDPCs) on 
osteogenic differentiation of human DFCs (hDFCs) in vitro and in vivo and to
compare gene expression in hDFCs in the presence or absence of hDPCs. To evaluate
the osteogenic differentiation of hDFCs induced by hDPCs, hDFCs were cultured in 
osteogenic medium with or without hDPCs-conditioned medium (CM) in vitro and the 
cells transplanted into the subcutaneous tissue of immunodeficient mice in vivo. 
The hDPCs-CM enhanced alkaline phosphatase promoter activity of hDFCs in
osteogenic culture. The expression of several osteoblast marker genes was
increased in hDFCs treated with hDPCs-CM compared to hDFCs in normal medium. The 
hDFCs induced by hDPCs-CM also produced more calcified nodules than hDFCs in
normal medium. In transplantation experiments, hDPCs-CM promoted the osteogenic
induction and bone formation of hDFCs. Microarray analysis and quantitative
real-time PCR showed that osteogenesis-related genes including WNT2, VCAN, OSR2, 
FOSB, and POSTN in hDFCs were significantly upregulated after induction by
hDPCs-CM compared to hDFCs in normal medium. These findings indicate that hDPCs
could increase the expression of osteogenic genes in hDFCs and stimulate their
osteogenesis and could be a cellular resource for bone regeneration therapy when 
induced by hDPCs-derived factors.

<U+2206>FosB: a transcriptional regulator of stress and antidepressant responses.

of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. Electronic address:

<U+0394>FosB is a member of the Fos family of transcription factors. While other family 
members are induced rapidly but transiently in response to a host of acute
stimuli, <U+0394>FosB is unique in that it accumulates in response to repeated
stimulation due to its unusual protein stability. Such prolonged induction of
<U+0394>FosB, within nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward region, has been most
studied in animal models of drug addiction, with considerable evidence indicating
that <U+0394>FosB promotes reward and motivation and serves as a mechanism of drug
sensitization and increased drug self-administration. In more recent years,
prolonged induction of <U+2206>FosB has also been observed within NAc in response to
chronic administration of certain forms of stress. Increasing evidence indicates 
that this induction represents a positive, homeostatic adaptation to chronic
stress, since overexpression of <U+2206>FosB in this brain region promotes resilience to
stress, whereas blockade of its activity promotes stress susceptibility. Chronic 
administration of several antidepressant medications also induces <U+2206>FosB in the
NAc, and this induction is required for the therapeutic-like actions of these
drugs in mouse models. Validation of these rodent findings is the demonstration
that depressed humans, examined at autopsy, display reduced levels of <U+2206>FosB
within the NAc. As a transcription factor, <U+0394>FosB produces this behavioral
phenotype by regulating the expression of specific target genes, which are under 
current investigation. These studies of <U+0394>FosB are providing new insight into the 
molecular basis of depression and antidepressant action, which is defining a host
of new targets for possible therapeutic development.

The present study investigated whether 3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acid (TMCA)
treatment ameliorated restraint stress-provoked anxiety- and depression-like
behaviors in mice. Fourteen consecutive days of restraint stress produced
anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, including reduced time and frequency in
the open arms of the elevated plus maze (EPM), as well as enhanced immobility
times in the forced swim test (FST). However, TMCA (50 mg/kg) treatment
ameliorated this effect; mice showed increased time and frequency of visits in
the open arms of the EPM and showed reduced immobility in the FST. In parallel
with the behavioral data, long-lasting stimulation of <U+0394>FosB in the nucleus
accumbens shell subregion was exhibited in response to TMCA. Furthermore, a
reduction in expression of SC1, a target of <U+0394>FosB, in the nucleus accumbens of
mice subjected to restraint stress was significantly reversed by TMCA (50 mg/kg) 
treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that TMCA treatment might provide 
a therapeutic strategy for treatment of anxiety and depression.

BACKGROUND: A systematic search of brain nuclei putatively involved in
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia (LID) in Parkinson's
disease shed light, notably, upon the lateral habenula (LHb), which displayed an 
overexpression of the <U+2206>FosB, ARC, and Zif268 immediate-early genes only in rats
experiencing abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs). We thus hypothesized that LHb
might play a role in LID.
METHODS: <U+2206>FosB immunoreactivity, 2-deoxyglucose uptake, and firing activity of
LHb were studied in experimental models of Parkinson's disease and LID.
<U+0394>FosB-expressing LHb neurons were then targeted using the Daun02-inactivation
method. A total of 18 monkeys and 55 rats were used.
RESULTS: LHb was found to be metabolically modified in dyskinetic monkeys and its
neuronal firing frequency significantly increased in ON L-DOPA dyskinetic
6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats, suggesting that increased LHb neuronal activity 
in response to L-DOPA is related to AIM manifestation. Therefore, to
mechanistically test if LHb neuronal activity might affect AIM severity,
following induction of AIMs, 6-hydroxydopamine rats were injected with Daun02 in 
the LHb previously transfected with ß-galactosidase under control of the FosB
promoter. Three days after Daun02 administration, animals were tested daily with 
L-DOPA to assess LID and L-DOPA-induced rotations. Inactivation of
<U+2206>FosB-expressing neurons significantly reduced AIM severity and also increased
rotations. Interestingly, the dopaminergic D1 receptor was overexpressed only on 
the lesioned side of dyskinetic rats in LHb and co-localized with <U+0394>FosB,
suggesting a D1 receptor-mediated mechanism supporting the LHb involvement in
AIMs.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the role of LHb in LID, offering a new target 
to innovative treatments of LID.

Characterization of fosA5, a new plasmid-mediated fosfomycin resistance gene in
Escherichia coli.

A clinical strain of extended-spectrum ß-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli
E265, with a fosfomycin MIC of 512 µg ml(-1), was isolated from an inpatient with
hospital-acquired pneumonia. This strain was negative for known fos genes, had no
mutation in the target enzyme by polymerase chain reaction amplification and had 
functional transport systems for fosfomycin uptake. Fosfomycin resistance could
be transferred from strain E265 to E. coli J53 azide(R) by conjugation. The DNA
fragment containing fosfomycin resistance determinants was cloned into E. coli
TOP10. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of fosfomycin for the transconjugant
and transformant were 512 and 1024 µg ml(-1). By sequencing, a plasmid-mediated
fosA subtype, designated fosA5, was found and characterized. The fosA5 gene was
420 bp in length and encoded a 139-amino-acid protein that shared 69 to 80%
identity with FosA, FosA2, FosA3 and FosA4, and 31, 14 and 25% identity with
FosB, FosC and FosX, respectively. The analysis of genetic environment of fosA5
suggested that a strain such as Klebsiella pneumoniae CG4 might be the origin of 
plasmid-mediated fosA5, with IS10 playing an important role in its
mobilization.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to clone and 
characterize a plasmid-mediated fosA subtype gene, fosA5, in a clinical strain of
ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, which confers fosfomycin resistance. Detection
of the fosA5 gene clarified the mechanism of fosfomycin resistance in a strain
that was negative for known fosfomycin resistance genes. Monitoring and
surveillance will be important to follow the changes in fosfomycin resistance and
prevent further dissemination of fos genes.

Detection of hypoxia markers in the cerebellum after a traumatic frontal cortex
injury: a human postmortem gene expression analysis.

PURPOSE: The response to traumatic brain injury (TBI) is complex and induces
various biological pathways in all brain regions that contribute to bad outcomes.
The cerebellar hypoxia after a frontal cortex injury may potentiate the
pathophysiological impacts of TBI. Therefore, a gene expression analysis was
conducted to determine the influence of hypoxia on TBIs.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Total RNA, including microRNAs, was isolated from the
cerebellum of individuals who had died from severe frontal cortex injuries or due
to natural causes of death (reference group).
RESULTS: From a total of 19,596 genes, an average of 59.56% messenger RNAs
(mRNAs) appeared expressed with 42 of them showing significant >2-fold
differences of upregulated (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>18) and downregulated (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>24) genes. The
validity of 14 candidate genes (with low p values and high fold differences or
based on cited literature) was confirmed using qRT-PCR (Spearman correlation
r(2)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.93). Only four genes appeared to be either upregulated (FOSB and IL6) or
downregulated (HSD11B1 and HSPA12B). From a total of 667 microRNAs, altogether,
248 microRNAs appeared expressed with 13 of them showing significant differences 
in the mean gene expression. The combination of two mRNAs (HSPA12B/FOSB or
IL6/HSD11B1) or two microRNAs (either miR-138/miR-744 or miR-195/miR-324-5p)
completely discriminated both groups, a finding unaltered by potential
confounders such as age at biosampling, survival time, and the postmortem
interval.
CONCLUSIONS: Cerebellar hypoxia markers are important to understand the
pathophysiology of TBIs and could be used for therapeutic strategies or forensic 
purposes, e.g., to assess the severity of a brain injury.

Motherhood involves a switch in natural rewards, whereby offspring become highly 
rewarding. Nucleus accumbens (NAC) is a key CNS region for natural rewards and
addictions, but to date no study has evaluated on a large scale the events in NAC
that underlie the maternal change in natural rewards. In this study we utilized
microarray and bioinformatics approaches to evaluate postpartum NAC gene
expression changes in mice. Modular Single-set Enrichment Test (MSET) indicated
that postpartum (relative to virgin) NAC gene expression profile was
significantly enriched for genes related to addiction and reward in five of five 
independently curated databases (e.g., Malacards, Phenopedia). Over 100
addiction/reward related genes were identified and these included: Per1, Per2,
Arc, Homer2, Creb1, Grm3, Fosb, Gabrb3, Adra2a, Ntrk2, Cry1, Penk, Cartpt, Adcy1,
Npy1r, Htr1a, Drd1a, Gria1, and Pdyn. ToppCluster analysis found maternal NAC
expression profile to be significantly enriched for genes related to the drug
action of nicotine, ketamine, and dronabinol. Pathway analysis indicated
postpartum NAC as enriched for RNA processing, CNS development/differentiation,
and transcriptional regulation. Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis
(WGCNA) identified possible networks for transcription factors, including Nr1d1, 
Per2, Fosb, Egr1, and Nr4a1. The postpartum state involves increased risk for
mental health disorders and MSET analysis indicated postpartum NAC to be enriched
for genes related to depression, bipolar disorder (BPD), and schizophrenia.
Mental health related genes included: Fabp7, Grm3, Penk, and Nr1d1. We confirmed 
via quantitative PCR Nr1d1, Per2, Grm3, Penk, Drd1a, and Pdyn. This study
indicates for the first time that postpartum NAC involves large scale gene
expression alterations linked to addiction and reward. Because the postpartum
state also involves decreased response to drugs, the findings could provide
insights into how to mitigate addictions.

The study aimed to dissect the molecular mechanism of pancreatic cancer by a
range of bioinformatics approaches. Three microarray datasets (GSE32676,
GSE21654, and GSE14245) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database.
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with logarithm of fold change (|logFC|)
>0.585 and p value <0.05 were identified between pancreatic cancer samples and
normal controls. Transcription factors (TFs) were selected from the DEGs based on
TRASFAC database. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
pathway enrichment analyses were performed for the DEGs using The Database for
Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (p value <0.05), followed by
construction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network using Search Tool for
the Retrieval of Interacting Genes software. Latent pathway identification
analysis was applied to analyze the DEGs-related pathways crosstalk and the
pathways with high weight value were included in the pathway crosstalk network
using Cytoscape. Sixty-five DEGs were screened out. CCAAT/enhancer-binding
protein delta (CEBPD), FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene B (FOSB), Stratifin (SFN),
Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), Pentraxin 3 (PTX3), and nuclear receptor subfamily 
4, group A, member 3 (NR4A3) were important TFs. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was the hub
node of the PPI network. DEGs were significantly enriched in NOD-like receptor
signaling pathway which was primarily interacted with inflammation and immune
related pathways (cytosolic DNA-sensing, hematopoietic cell lineage, intestinal
immune network for IgA production and chemokine pathways). The study suggested
CEBPD, FOSB, SFN, KLF5, PTX3, NR4A3, IL-6, and NOD-like receptor pathways were
involved in pancreatic cancer.

One purpose of the EC funded project, SPIDIA, is to develop evidence-based
quality guidelines for the pre-analytical handling of blood samples for RNA
molecular testing. To this end, two pan-European External Quality Assessments
(EQAs) were implemented. Here we report the results of the second SPIDIA-RNA EQA.
This second study included modifications in the protocol related to the blood
collection process, the shipping conditions and pre-analytical specimen handling 
for participants. Participating laboratories received two identical proficiency
blood specimens collected in tubes with or without an RNA stabilizer. For
pre-defined specimen storage times and temperatures, laboratories were asked to
perform RNA extraction from whole blood according to their usual procedure and to
return extracted RNA to the SPIDIA facility for further analysis. These RNA
samples were evaluated for purity, yield, integrity, stability, presence of
interfering substances, and gene expression levels for the validated markers of
RNA stability: FOS, IL1B, IL8, GAPDH, FOSB and TNFRSF10c. Analysis of the gene
expression results of FOS, IL8, FOSB, and TNFRSF10c, however, indicated that the 
levels of these transcripts were significantly affected by blood collection tube 
type and storage temperature. These results demonstrated that only blood
collection tubes containing a cellular RNA stabilizer allowed reliable gene
expression analysis within 48 h from blood collection for all the genes
investigated. The results of these two EQAs have been proposed for use in the
development of a Technical Specification by the European Committee for
Standardization.

There is an increasing need for proper quality control tools in the
pre-analytical phase of the molecular diagnostic workflow. The aim of the present
study was to identify biomarkers for monitoring pre-analytical mRNA quality
variations in two different types of blood collection tubes, K2EDTA (EDTA) tubes 
and PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes (PAXgene tubes). These tubes are extensively used
both in the diagnostic setting as well as for research biobank samples. Blood
specimens collected in the two different blood collection tubes were stored for
varying times at different temperatures, and microarray analysis was performed on
resultant extracted RNA. A large set of potential mRNA quality biomarkers for
monitoring post-phlebotomy gene expression changes and mRNA degradation in blood 
was identified. qPCR assays for the potential biomarkers and a set of relevant
reference genes were generated and used to pre-validate a sub-set of the selected
biomarkers. The assay precision of the potential qPCR based biomarkers was
determined, and a final validation of the selected quality biomarkers using the
developed qPCR assays and blood samples from 60 healthy additional subjects was
performed. In total, four mRNA quality biomarkers (USP32, LMNA, FOSB, TNRFSF10C) 
were successfully validated. We suggest here the use of these blood mRNA quality 
biomarkers for validating an experimental pre-analytical workflow. These
biomarkers were further evaluated in the 2nd ring trial of the SPIDIA-RNA Program
which demonstrated that these biomarkers can be used as quality control tools for
mRNA analyses from blood samples.

Animals with a history of sodium depletions exhibit increases in salt intake, a
phenomenon described as the sensitization of sodium appetite. Using a novel
experimental design, the present experiments investigated whether putative
molecular markers of neural plasticity and changes in the message for components 
of the brain renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) accompany the
sensitization of sodium appetite. An initial set of experiments examined whether 
the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist MK-801 would attenuate
sodium appetite sensitization and prevent changes in mRNA expression associated
with sensitization. Rats with repeated sodium depletions exhibited enhanced
sodium appetite and mRNA expression for components of the RAAS in areas along the
lamina terminalis (LT), a region of the brain that is important for the
regulation of body fluid homeostasis, and these effects were significantly
attenuated by MK-801 pretreatment. A second set of experiments investigated
whether successive sodium depletions would elevate sodium intake and induce a
pattern of fos-B staining consistent with the <U+0394>fos-B isoform in areas along the
LT. The pattern of fos-B staining in the subfornical organ was consistent with
the characteristics of <U+0394>fos-B expression. Specifically, fos-B/<U+0394>fos-B expression
was increased 4 days after the last of a series of sodium depletions,
fos-B/<U+0394>fos-B expression was nearly absent in control rats, and the quantity of
fos-B/<U+0394>fos-B staining was directly associated with a history of sodium
depletions. These findings demonstrate that the sensitization of sodium appetite 
is associated with sustained molecular alterations in the LT that are indicative 
of neural plasticity and upregulation of the central RAAS.

Chronic exposure to drugs of abuse or stress regulates transcription factors,
chromatin-modifying enzymes and histone post-translational modifications in
discrete brain regions. Given the promiscuity of the enzymes involved, it has not
yet been possible to obtain direct causal evidence to implicate the regulation of
transcription and consequent behavioral plasticity by chromatin remodeling that
occurs at a single gene. We investigated the mechanism linking chromatin dynamics
to neurobiological phenomena by applying engineered transcription factors to
selectively modify chromatin at a specific mouse gene in vivo. We found that
histone methylation or acetylation at the Fosb locus in nucleus accumbens, a
brain reward region, was sufficient to control drug- and stress-evoked
transcriptional and behavioral responses via interactions with the endogenous
transcriptional machinery. This approach allowed us to relate the epigenetic
landscape at a given gene directly to regulation of its expression and to its
subsequent effects on reward behavior.

BACKGROUND: Cryopreservation is an acknowledged procedure to store vital cells
for future biomarker analyses. Few studies, however, have analyzed the impact of 
the cryopreservation on phenotyping.
METHODS: We have performed a controlled comparison of cryopreserved and fresh
cellular aliquots prepared from individual healthy donors. We studied circulating
B-cell subset membrane markers and global gene expression, respectively by
multiparametric flow cytometry and microarray data. Extensive statistical
analysis of the generated data tested the concept that "overall, there are no
phenotypic differences between cryopreserved and fresh B-cell subsets."
Subsequently, we performed an uncontrolled comparison of tonsil tissue samples.
RESULTS: By multiparametric flow analysis, we documented no significant changes
following cryopreservation of subset frequencies or membrane intensity for the
differentiation markers CD19, CD20, CD22, CD27, CD38, CD45, and CD200. By gene
expression profiling following cryopreservation, across all samples, only 16 out 
of 18708 genes were significantly up or down regulated, including FOSB, KLF4,
RBP7, ANXA1 or CLC, DEFA3, respectively. Implementation of cryopreserved tissue
in our research program allowed us to present a performance analysis, by
comparing cryopreserved and fresh tonsil tissue. As expected, phenotypic
differences were identified, but to an extent that did not affect the performance
of the cryopreserved tissue to generate specific B-cell subset associated gene
signatures and assign subset phenotypes to independent tissue samples.
CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed our working concept and illustrated the usefulness
of vital cryopreserved cell suspensions for phenotypic studies of the normal
B-cell hierarchy; however, storage procedures need to be delineated by
tissue-specific comparative analysis.

Previous work has implicated the transcription factor, <U+0394>FosB, acting in the
nucleus accumbens, in mediating the pro-rewarding effects of drugs of abuse such 
as cocaine as well as in mediating resilience to chronic social stress. However, 
the transgenic and viral gene transfer models used to establish these <U+0394>FosB
phenotypes express, in addition to <U+0394>FosB, an alternative translation product of
<U+0394>FosB mRNA, termed <U+0394>2<U+0394>FosB, which lacks the N-terminal 78 aa present in <U+0394>FosB. To
study the possible contribution of <U+0394>2<U+0394>FosB to these drug and stress phenotypes,
we prepared a viral vector that overexpresses a point mutant form of <U+0394>FosB mRNA
which cannot undergo alternative translation as well as a vector that
overexpresses <U+0394>2<U+0394>FosB alone. Our results show that the mutant form of <U+0394>FosB, when
overexpressed in the nucleus accumbens, reproduces the enhancement of reward and 
of resilience seen with our earlier models, with no effects seen for <U+0394>2<U+0394>FosB.
Overexpression of full length FosB, the other major product of the FosB gene,
also has no effect. These findings confirm the unique role of <U+0394>FosB in the
nucleus accumbens in controlling responses to drugs of abuse and stress.

on periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs). The dried herb of Z. schinifolium
was first extracted with 70% ethanol and subsequently fractionated into five
parts: n-hexane, methylene chloride (MC), ethyl acetate (EA), n-butanol (BuOH),
and water fractions. The proliferation of PDLSCs was first assessed and increased
by hexane, EA, or BuOH fraction of Z. schinifolium. We evaluated the osteogenic
differentiation of PDLSCs by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, messenger RNA
(mRNA) expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), osterix (OSX), 
FOSB, and FRA-1 as osteogenic transcription factors, and protein levels of
osteopontin (OPN) and RUNX2 in response to each hexane, MC, EA, BuOH, or water
fraction of Z. schinifolium. The significant ALP activity appeared in PDLSCs
treated with hexane, EA, or BuOH fraction. The mRNA expression of osteogenic
transcription factors was also increased by hexane, EA, or BuOH fraction with
doses of 5, 10, 25, and 50 µg/ml compared to control group. We further assessed
immunofluorescence staining with OPN and RUNX2 confirmed that the treatment of
hexane, EA, or BuOH fraction enhances PDLSC osteogenic differentiation. In
conclusion, these data suggest that fractions from Z. schinifolium differentially
regulate PDLSC function. Among them, proliferation and osteogenic potential of
PDLSCs were enhanced by hexane, EA, or BuOH fraction.

Nitric oxide (NO), a gaseous messenger molecule synthesized by nitric oxide
synthase (NOS), plays a pivotal role in integrating dopamine transmission in the 
basal ganglia and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease
(PD). To study the role of the nitrergic system in l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia
(LID), we assessed the effect of the pharmacological manipulation of NO levels
and NO/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling on LID in the Pitx3(-/-)
aphakia mouse, a genetic model of PD. To evaluate the effect of decreased NO
signaling on the development of LID, Pitx3(-/-) mice were chronically treated
with l-DOPA and 7-nitroindazole (7-NI, a neuronal NOS inhibitor). To evaluate its
effect on the expression of established LID, 7-NI was administered acutely to
dyskinetic mice. The chronic 7-NI treatment attenuated the development of LID in 
the Pitx3(-/-) mice, and the sub-acute 7-NI treatment attenuated established
dyskinesia without affecting the beneficial therapeutic effect of l-DOPA.
Moreover, 7-NI significantly reduced FosB and pAcH3 expression in the acutely and
chronically l-DOPA-treated mice. We also examined how increasing NO/cGMP
signaling affects LID expression by acutely administering molsidomine (an NO
donor) or zaprinast (a cGMP phosphodiesterase 5-PDE5 inhibitor) before l-DOPA in 
mice with established dyskinesia. Paradoxically, the administration of either of 
these drugs also significantly diminished the expression of established LID;
however, the effect occurred at the expense of the antiparkinsonian l-DOPA
properties. We demonstrate that targeting the NO/cGMP signaling pathway reduces
dyskinetic behaviors and molecular markers, but only the 7-NI treatment preserved
the antiparkinsonian effect of l-DOPA, indicating that NOS inhibitors represent a
potential therapy to reduce LID.

Persistent at-level thermal hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia accompany chronic 
neuronal and astrocyte activation in superficial dorsal horn following mouse
cervical contusion spinal cord injury.

In humans, sensory abnormalities, including neuropathic pain, often result from
traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). SCI can induce cellular changes in the CNS,
termed central sensitization, that alter excitability of spinal cord neurons,
including those in the dorsal horn involved in pain transmission. Persistently
elevated levels of neuronal activity, glial activation, and glutamatergic
transmission are thought to contribute to the hyperexcitability of these dorsal
horn neurons, which can lead to maladaptive circuitry, aberrant pain processing
and, ultimately, chronic neuropathic pain. Here we present a mouse model of
SCI-induced neuropathic pain that exhibits a persistent pain phenotype
accompanied by chronic neuronal hyperexcitability and glial activation in the
spinal cord dorsal horn. We generated a unilateral cervical contusion injury at
the C5 or C6 level of the adult mouse spinal cord. Following injury, an increase 
in the number of neurons expressing <U+0394>FosB (a marker of chronic neuronal
activation), persistent astrocyte activation and proliferation (as measured by
GFAP and Ki67 expression), and a decrease in the expression of the astrocyte
glutamate transporter GLT1 are observed in the ipsilateral superficial dorsal
horn of cervical spinal cord. These changes have previously been associated with 
neuronal hyperexcitability and may contribute to altered pain transmission and
chronic neuropathic pain. In our model, they are accompanied by robust at-level
hyperaglesia in the ipsilateral forepaw and allodynia in both forepaws that are
evident within two weeks following injury and persist for at least six weeks.
Furthermore, the pain phenotype occurs in the absence of alterations in forelimb 
grip strength, suggesting that it represents sensory and not motor abnormalities.
Given the importance of transgenic mouse technology, this clinically-relevant
model provides a resource that can be used to study the molecular mechanisms
contributing to neuropathic pain following SCI and to identify potential
therapeutic targets for the treatment of chronic pathological pain.

Inhibition of phosphodiesterase10A attenuates morphine-induced conditioned place 
preference.

Mu Y, Ren Z, Jia J, Gao B, Zheng L, Wang G, Friedman E, Zhen X.

BACKGROUND: Phosphodiesterase (PDE) 10A is selectively expressed in medium spiny 
neurons of the striatum. Nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key region that mediates
drug reward and addiction-related behaviors. To investigate the potential role of
PDE10A in the reinforcement properties of morphine, we tested the effect of
MP-10, a selective inhibitor of PDE10A, on acquisition, expression, and
extinction of morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP).
RESULTS: The results show that 2.5 mg/kg MP-10, administered subcutaneously,
significantly inhibited the acquisition of morphine-induced CPP. The same dose of
MP-10 alone did not result in the CPP. Moreover, MP-10 did not alter the
expression of morphine-induced CPP, but did accelerate the extinction of
morphine-induced CPP. Additionally, chronic treatment with 2.5 mg/kg MP-10
decreased expression of phosphorylated CREB (pCREB), activated cAMP response
element binding protein, in dorsomedial striatum, in shell of NAc, and in
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as well as decreased expression of <U+0394>FosB in the
shell of NAc and ACC.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that inhibition of PDE10A may have therapeutic
potential in the treatment of opioid addiction.

Background Cryopreservation is an acknowledged procedure to store vital cells for
future biomarker analyses. Few studies, however, have analyzed the impact of the 
cryopreservation on phenotyping. Methods We have performed a controlled
comparison of cryopreserved and fresh cellular aliquots prepared from individual 
healthy donors. We studied circulating B-cell subset membrane markers and global 
gene expression, respectively by multiparametric flow cytometry and microarray
data. Extensive statistical analysis of the generated data tested the concept
that "overall, there are phenotypic differences between cryopreserved and fresh
B-cell subsets". Subsequently, we performed a consecutive uncontrolled comparison
of tonsil tissue samples. Results By multiparametric flow analysis, we documented
no significant changes following cryopreservation of subset frequencies or
membrane intensity for the differentiation markers CD19, CD20, CD22, CD27, CD38, 
CD45, and CD200. By gene expression profiling following cryopreservation, across 
all samples, only 16 out of 18708 genes were significantly up or down regulated, 
including FOSB, KLF4, RBP7, ANXA1 or CLC, DEFA3, respectively. Implementation of 
cryopreserved tissue in our research program allowed us to present a performance 
analysis, by comparing cryopreserved and fresh tonsil tissue. As expected,
phenotypic differences were identified, but to an extent that did not affect the 
performance of the cryopreserved tissue to generate specific B-cell subset
associated gene signatures and assign subset phenotypes to independent tissue
samples. Conclusions We have confirmed our working concept and illustrated the
usefulness of vital cryopreserved cell suspensions for phenotypic studies of the 
normal B-cell hierarchy; however, storage procedures need to be delineated by
tissue specific comparative analysis. © 2014 Clinical Cytometry Society.

In advanced Parkinson's disease, l-DOPA treatment causes the appearance of
abnormal involuntary movements or l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). LID results in
part from l-DOPA-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) in the dopamine-denervated striatum. Activated ERK triggers nuclear
responses, including phosphorylation of mitogen- and stress-activated protein
kinase 1 (MSK1) and histone H3, and transcription of genes such as FosB. To
determine the role of MSK1, wild type and MSK1 knockout mice with unilateral
6-hydroxydopamine lesion in the dorsolateral striatum were chronically treated
with l-DOPA. The absence of MSK1 had no effect on the lesion or l-DOPA-induced
ERK activation, but reduced l-DOPA-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 and FosB
accumulation in the dopamine-denervated striatum. MSK1 deficiency also prevented 
the increase in Gaolf, the stimulatory a subunit of G protein coupling striatal
dopamine D1 receptor to adenylyl cyclase. However, the intensity of LID was
similar in MSK1-deficient and wild type mice. In conclusion, l-DOPA-induced
activation of MSK1 contributes to histone H3 phosphorylation, induction of FosB, 
and Gaolf up-regulation but appears not to be necessary for the development of
LID.

Environmental enrichment produces protective addiction and depression phenotypes 
in rats. <U+0394>FosB is a transcription factor that regulates reward in the brain and
is induced by psychological stress as well as drugs of abuse. However, the role
played by <U+0394>FosB in the protective phenotypes of environmental enrichment has not 
been well studied. Here, we demonstrate that <U+0394>FosB is differentially regulated in
rats reared in an isolated condition (IC) compared to those in an enriched
condition (EC) in response to restraint stress or cocaine. Chronic stress or
chronic cocaine treatment each elevates <U+0394>FosB protein levels in the nucleus
accumbens (NAc) of IC rats, but not of EC rats due to an already elevated basal
accumulation of <U+0394>FosB seen under EC conditions. Viral-mediated overexpression of 
<U+0394>FosB in the NAc shell of pair-housed rats (i.e., independent of environmental
enrichment/isolation) increases operant responding for sucrose when motivated by 
hunger, but decreases responding in satiated animals. Moreover, <U+0394>FosB
overexpression decreases cocaine self-administration, enhances extinction of
cocaine seeking, and decreases cocaine-induced reinstatement of intravenous
cocaine self-administration; all behavioral findings consistent with the
enrichment phenotype. In contrast, however, <U+0394>FosB overexpression did not alter
responses of pair-housed rats in several tests of anxiety- and depression-related
behavior. Thus, <U+0394>FosB in the NAc the shell mimics the protective addiction
phenotype, but not the protective depression phenotype of environmental
enrichment.

Pain and depression are frequently associated with and often persist after
resolution of an initial injury. Identifying the extent to which depression
remains causally associated with ongoing physical discomfort during chronic pain,
or becomes independent of it, is an important problem for basic neuroscience and 
psychiatry. Difficulty in distinguishing between effects of ongoing aversive
sensory input and its long-term consequences is a significant roadblock,
especially in animal models. To address this relationship between localized
physical discomfort and its more global consequences, we investigated cellular
and behavioral changes during and after reversing a mouse model of neuropathic
pain. Tactile allodynia produced by placing a plastic cuff around the sciatic
nerve resolved within several days when the cuff was removed. In contrast, the
changes in elevated O-maze, forced-swim, Y-maze spontaneous alternation and
novel-object recognition test performance that developed after nerve cuff
placement remained for at least 3 weeks after the nerve cuffs were removed, or
10-15 d following complete normalization of mechanical sensitivity. Hippocampal
neurogenesis, measured by doublecortin and proliferating cell nuclear antigen
expression, was also suppressed after nerve cuff placement and remained
suppressed 3 weeks after cuff removal. FosB expression was elevated in the
central nucleus of the amygdala and spinal cord dorsal horn only in mice with
ongoing allodynia. In contrast, FosB remained elevated in the basolateral
amygdala of mice with resolved nociception and persisting behavioral effects.
These observations suggest that different processes control tactile
hypersensitivity and the behavioral changes and impaired neurogenesis that are
associated with neuropathic allodynia.

BACKGROUND: Abnormal regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2
has been implicated in 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia 
(LID), a motor complication affecting Parkinson's disease patients subjected to
standard pharmacotherapy. We examined the involvement of mitogen- and
stress-activated kinase 1 (MSK1), a downstream target of extracellular
signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2, and an important regulator of transcription in 
LID.
METHODS: 6-Hydroxydopamine was used to produce a model of Parkinson's disease in 
MSK1 knockout mice and in <U+2206>FosB- or <U+2206>cJun-overexpressing transgenic mice, which
were assessed for LID following long-term L-DOPA administration. Biochemical
processes were evaluated by Western blotting or immunofluorescence. Histone H3
phosphorylation was analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by
promotor-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Genetic inactivation of MSK1 attenuated LID and reduced the
phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 in the striatum. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis showed that this reduction occurred at the level of 
the fosB gene promoter. In line with this observation, the accumulation of <U+2206>FosB 
produced by chronic L-DOPA was reduced in MSK1 knockout. Moreover, inducible
overexpression of <U+2206>FosB in striatonigral medium spiny neurons exacerbated
dyskinetic behavior, whereas overexpression of <U+2206>cJun, which reduces
<U+2206>FosB-dependent transcriptional activation, counteracted LID.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that abnormal regulation of MSK1 contributes to the
development of LID and to the concomitant increase in striatal <U+2206>FosB, which may
occur via increased histone H3 phosphorylation at the fosB promoter. Results also
show that accumulation of <U+2206>FosB in striatonigral neurons is causally related to
the development of dyskinesia.

Intermittent PTH administration stimulates bone formation and counteracts the
inhibition of bone formation by glucocorticoid excess. We have previously
demonstrated that PTH enhances interleukin (IL) -11 gene transcription by a rapid
induction of delta-fosB expression and Smad1/5 phosphorylation. On the other
hand, glucocorticoid can suppress osteoblast differentiation and enhance
apoptosis of osteoblast cells via down-regulation of IL-11 expression. PTH could 
reverse glucocorticoid-induced these damage of osteoblast via stimulation of
IL-11 expression. Our data also suggested that IL-11 mediates stimulatory and
inhibitory signals of osteoblast differentiation by affecting Wnt signaling.
These data demonstrates that PTH and glucocorticoid may regulate osteoblast
differentiation and apoptosis via their effect on IL-11 expression.

The dopamine precursor L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is widely used as a 
therapeutic choice for the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease.
However, the long-term use of L-DOPA leads to the development of debilitating
involuntary movements, called L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). The cAMP/protein
kinase A (PKA) signaling in the striatum is known to play a role in LID. However,
from among the nine known adenylyl cyclases (ACs) present in the striatum, the AC
that mediates LID remains unknown. To address this issue, we prepared an animal
model with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions in the substantia nigra in
wild-type and AC5-knock-out (KO) mice, and examined behavioral responses to
short-term or long-term treatment with L-DOPA. Compared with the behavioral
responses of wild-type mice, LID was profoundly reduced in AC5-KO mice. The
behavioral protection of long-term treatment with L-DOPA in AC5-KO mice was
preceded by a decrease in the phosphorylation levels of PKA substrates ERK
(extracellular signal-regulated kinase) 1/2, MSK1 (mitogen- and stress-activated 
protein kinase 1), and histone H3, levels of which were all increased in the
lesioned striatum of wild-type mice. Consistently, FosB/<U+0394>FosB expression, which
was induced by long-term L-DOPA treatment in the lesioned striatum, was also
decreased in AC5-KO mice. Moreover, suppression of AC5 in the dorsal striatum
with lentivirus-shRNA-AC5 was sufficient to attenuate LID, suggesting that the
AC5-regulated signaling cascade in the striatum mediates LID. These results
identify the AC5/cAMP system in the dorsal striatum as a therapeutic target for
the treatment of LID in patients with Parkinson's disease.

BACKGROUND: <U+0394>FosB is a surrogate marker of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID), the
unavoidable disabling consequence of Parkinson's disease L-DOPA long-term
treatment. However, the relationship between the electrical activity of
FosB/<U+0394>FosB-expressing neurons and LID manifestation is unknown.
METHODS: We used the Daun02 prodrug-inactivation method associated with
lentiviral expression of ß-galactosidase under the control of the FosB promoter
to investigate a causal link between the activity of FosB/<U+0394>FosB-expressing
neurons and dyskinesia severity in both rat and monkey models of Parkinson's
disease and LID. Whole-cell recordings of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) were
performed to assess the effects of Daun02 and daunorubicin on neuronal
excitability.
RESULTS: We first show that daunorubicin, the active product of Daun02 metabolism
by ß-galactosidase, decreases the activity of MSNs in rat brain slices and that
Daun02 strongly decreases the excitability of rat MSN primary cultures expressing
ß-galactosidase upon D1 dopamine receptor stimulation. We then demonstrate that
the selective, and reversible, inhibition of FosB/<U+0394>FosB-expressing striatal
neurons with Daun02 decreases the severity of LID while improving the beneficial 
effect of L-DOPA.
CONCLUSIONS: These results establish that FosB/<U+0394>FosB accumulation ultimately
results in altered neuronal electrical properties sustaining maladaptive circuits
leading not only to LID but also to a blunted response to L-DOPA. These findings 
further reveal that targeting dyskinesia can be achieved without reducing the
antiparkinsonian properties of L-DOPA when specifically inhibiting
FosB/<U+0394>FosB-accumulating neurons.

Stable changes in neuronal gene expression have been studied as mediators of
addicted states. Of particular interest is the transcription factor <U+0394>FosB, a
truncated and stable FosB gene product whose expression in nucleus accumbens
(NAc), a key reward region, is induced by chronic exposure to virtually all drugs
of abuse and regulates their psychomotor and rewarding effects. Phosphorylation
at Ser(27) contributes to <U+0394>FosB's stability and accumulation following repeated
exposure to drugs, and our recent work demonstrates that the protein kinase
CaMKIIa phosphorylates <U+0394>FosB at Ser(27) and regulates its stability in vivo.
Here, we identify two additional sites on <U+0394>FosB that are phosphorylated in vitro 
by CaMKIIa, Thr(149) and Thr(180), and demonstrate their regulation in vivo by
chronic cocaine. We show that phosphomimetic mutation of Thr(149) (T149D)
dramatically increases AP-1 transcriptional activity while alanine mutation does 
not affect transcriptional activity when compared with wild-type (WT) <U+0394>FosB.
Using in vivo viral-mediated gene transfer of <U+0394>FosB-T149D or <U+0394>FosB-T149A in mouse
NAc, we determined that overexpression of <U+0394>FosB-T149D in NAc leads to greater
locomotor activity in response to an initial low dose of cocaine than does WT
<U+0394>FosB, while overexpression of <U+0394>FosB-T149A does not produce the psychomotor
sensitization to chronic low-dose cocaine seen after overexpression of WT <U+0394>FosB
and abrogates the sensitization seen in control animals at higher cocaine doses. 
We further demonstrate that mutation of Thr(149) does not affect the stability of
<U+0394>FosB overexpressed in mouse NAc, suggesting that the behavioral effects of these
mutations are driven by their altered transcriptional properties.

In order to investigate the prevalence of fosfomycin-resistance (fos)
determinants in Enterococcus faecium, clinical strains were collected from
hospitals throughout China between January 2008 and December 2009. Antimicrobial 
susceptibility testing was performed, after which the fos genes in all isolates
and van genes in vancomycin-resistant isolates were characterized by PCR and
sequencing. Conjugation experiments were carried out with fosB-positive E.
faecium, DNA fragments flanking the fosB3 gene were sequenced and the genetic
environment of fosB3 was analysed. Fosfomycin-resistant E. faecium (FREF) strains
were characterized further by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and PFGE. Among
145 E. faecium clinical isolates, 10 were resistant to fosfomycin with MICs>1024 
mg l(-1) including six vancomycin-resistant strains of which five were
vanA-positive and the sixth vanM-positive. All ten FREF strains harboured the
fosB3 gene. Fosfomycin resistance and fosB3 could be transferred by conjugation
from nine isolates. The fosB3 and tnpA genes were located in a circular DNA
intermediate in all FREF strains and reversely inserted into vanA transposon
Tn1546 in four vanA-positive FREF isolates. Ten different PFGE types and seven
MLST types were found among the ten fosB3-positive isolates, while all strains
belonged to the common clonal complex CC17. In conclusion, the transferable
fosfomycin-resistance determinant fosB3 plays an important role in E. faecium
resistance to fosfomycin in China.

Asenapine is a new antipsychotic drug that induces a long-lasting behavioral
sensitization in adult rats. The present study investigated the developmental
impacts of adolescent asenapine treatment on drug sensitivity and on 3 proteins
implicated in the action of antipsychotic drugs (i.e. brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF), dopamine D2 receptor, and <U+0394>FosB) in adulthood. Male adolescent
Sprague-Dawley rats (postnatal days, P 43-48) were first treated with asenapine
(0.05, 0.10 or 0.20mg/kg, sc) and tested in the conditioned avoidance or PCP
(2.0mg/kg, sc)-induced hyperlocomotion tasks for 5 days. After they became adults
(~P 76), asenapine sensitization was assessed in a single avoidance or
PCP-induced hyperlocomotion challenge test with all rats being injected with
asenapine (0.10mg/kg, sc). Rats were then sacrificed 1 day later and BDNF, D2 and
<U+0394>FosB in the prefrontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus were examined using
Western blotting. In adolescence, repeated asenapine treatment produced a
persistent and dose-dependent inhibition of avoidance response, spontaneous motor
activity and PCP-induced hyperlocomotion. In the asenapine challenge test, adult 
rats treated with asenapine (0.10 and 0.20mg/kg) in adolescence made
significantly fewer avoidance responses and showed a stronger inhibition of
spontaneous motor activity than those previously treated with saline. However, no
group difference in the levels of BDNF, D2 and <U+0394>FosB expression was found. These 
findings suggest that although adolescent asenapine treatment for a short period 
of time induces a robust behavioral sensitization that persists into adulthood,
such a long-term effect is not likely to be mediated by BDNF, D2 and <U+0394>FosB.

Repeated <U+0394>(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) administration produces cannabinoid type
1 receptor (CB1R) desensitization and downregulation, as well as tolerance to its
in vivo pharmacological effects. However, the magnitude of CB1R desensitization
varies by brain region, with CB1Rs in the striatum and its output nuclei
undergoing less desensitization than other regions. A growing body of data
indicates that regional differences in CB1R desensitization are produced, in
part, by THC-mediated induction of the stable transcription factor, <U+0394>FosB, and
subsequent regulation of CB1Rs. The purpose of the present study was to determine
whether THC-mediated induction of <U+0394>FosB in the striatum inhibits CB1R
desensitization in the striatum and output nuclei. This hypothesis was tested
using bitransgenic mice with inducible expression of <U+0394>FosB or <U+0394>cJun, a dominant
negative inhibitor of AP-1-mediated transcription, in specific forebrain regions.
Mice were treated repeatedly with escalating doses of THC or vehicle for 6.5
days, and CB1R-mediated G-protein activation was assessed using
CP55,940-stimulated [(35)S]GTP<U+03B3>S autoradiography. Overexpression of <U+0394>FosB in
striatal dopamine type 1 receptor-containing (D1R) medium spiny neurons (MSNs)
attenuated CB1R desensitization in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area
(VTA) and amygdala. Expression of <U+0394>cJun in striatal D1R- and dopamine type 2
receptor (D2R)-containing MSNs enhanced CB1R desensitization in the
caudate-putamen and attenuated desensitization in the hippocampus and VTA.
THC-mediated in vivo pharmacological effects were then assessed in
<U+0394>cJun-expressing mice. Tolerance to THC-mediated hypomotility was enhanced in
<U+0394>cJun-expressing mice. These data reveal that <U+0394>FosB and possibly other AP-1
binding proteins regulate CB1R signaling and adaptation in the striatum and
limbic system.

Molecular neurobiology of addiction: what's all the (<U+0394>)FosB about?

School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London , London , UK.

The transcription factor <U+0394>FosB is upregulated in numerous brain regions following
repeated drug exposure. This induction is likely to, at least in part, be
responsible for the mechanisms underlying addiction, a disorder in which the
regulation of gene expression is thought to be essential. In this review, we
describe and discuss the proposed role of <U+0394>FosB as well as the implications of
recent findings. The expression of <U+0394>FosB displays variability dependent on the
administered substance, showing region-specificity for different drug stimuli.
This transcription factor is understood to act via interaction with Jun family
proteins and the formation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) complexes. Once AP-1
complexes are formed, a multitude of molecular pathways are initiated, causing
genetic, molecular and structural alterations. Many of these molecular changes
identified are now directly linked to the physiological and behavioral changes
observed following chronic drug exposure. In addition, <U+0394>FosB induction is being
considered as a biomarker for the evaluation of potential therapeutic
interventions for addiction.

This study assessed differential gene expression of signaling molecules involved 
in osteogenic differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs)
subjected to different titanium (Ti) surface types. PDLSCs were cultured on
tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS), and four types of Ti discs (PT, SLA,
hydrophilic PT (pmodPT), and hydrophilic SLA (modSLA)) with no osteoinductive
factor and then osteogenic activity, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
activity, mRNA expression of runt-related gene 2, osterix, FOSB, FRA1, and
protein levels of osteopontin and collagen type IA, were examined. The highest
osteogenic activity appeared in PDLSCs cultured on SLA, compared with the TCPS
and other Ti surfaces. The role of surface properties in affecting signaling
molecules to modulate PDLSC behavior was determined by examining the regulation
of Wnt pathways. mRNA expression of the canonical Wnt signaling molecules, Wnt3a 
and ß-catenin, was higher on SLA and modSLA than on smooth surfaces, but gene
expression of the calcium-dependent Wnt signaling molecules Wnt5a, calmodulin,
and NFATc1 was increased significantly on PT and pmodPT. Moreover, integrin
a2/ß1, sonic hedgehog, and Notch signaling molecules were affected differently by
each surface modification. In conclusion, surface roughness and hydrophilicity
can affect differential Wnt pathways and signaling molecules, targeting the
osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs.

Epithelioid hemangioma (EH) is a benign neoplasm with distinctive vasoformative
features, which occasionally shows increased cellularity, cytologic atypia,
and/or loco-regional aggressive growth, resulting in challenging differential
diagnosis from malignant vascular neoplasms. Based on two intraosseous EH index
cases with worrisome histologic features, such as the presence of necrosis, RNA
sequencing was applied for possible fusion gene discovery and potential
subclassification of a novel atypical EH subset. A ZFP36-FOSB fusion was detected
in one case, while a WWTR1-FOSB chimeric transcript in the other, both were
further validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These abnormalities were then
screened by FISH in 44 EH from different locations with seven additional EH
revealing FOSB gene rearrangements, all except one being fused to ZFP36.
Interestingly, 4/6 penile EH studied showed FOSB abnormalities. Although certain 
atypical histologic features were observed in the FOSB-rearranged EH, including
solid growth, increased cellularity, mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism, and
necrosis in 3/9 cases, no overt sarcomatous areas were discerned to objectively
separate the lesions from the fusion-negative EH. No patient has developed
recurrence to date, but the follow-up was relatively limited and short to draw
definitive conclusions regarding behavior. Although FOSB-rearranged EH do not
show significant morphologic overlap with SERPINE1-FOSB fusion-positive
pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, FOSB oncogenic activation is emerging as an 
important event in these benign and intermediate groups of vascular tumors.

Generating engraftable human haematopoietic cells from autologous tissues is a
potential route to new therapies for blood diseases. However, directed
differentiation of pluripotent stem cells yields haematopoietic cells that
engraft poorly. Here, we have devised a method to phenocopy the vascular-niche
microenvironment of haemogenic cells, thereby enabling reprogramming of human
endothelial cells into engraftable haematopoietic cells without transition
through a pluripotent intermediate. Highly purified non-haemogenic human
umbilical vein endothelial cells or adult dermal microvascular endothelial cells 
were transduced with the transcription factors FOSB, GFI1, RUNX1 and SPI1
(hereafter referred to as FGRS), and then propagated on serum-free instructive
vascular niche monolayers to induce outgrowth of haematopoietic colonies
containing cells with functional and immunophenotypic features of multipotent
progenitor cells (MPPs). These endothelial cells that have been reprogrammed into
human MPPs (rEC-hMPPs) acquire colony-forming-cell potential and durably engraft 
into immune-deficient mice after primary and secondary transplantation, producing
long-term rEC-hMPP-derived myeloid (granulocytic/monocytic, erythroid,
megakaryocytic) and lymphoid (natural killer and B cell) progenies. Conditional
expression of FGRS transgenes, combined with vascular induction, activates
endogenous FGRS genes, endowing rEC-hMPPs with a transcriptional and functional
profile similar to that of self-renewing MPPs. Our approach underscores the role 
of inductive cues from the vascular niche in coordinating and sustaining
haematopoietic specification and may prove useful for engineering autologous
haematopoietic grafts to treat inherited and acquired blood disorders.

Bile duct ligation (BDL) causes congestive liver failure that initiates
hemodynamic changes, resulting in dilutional hyponatremia due to increased water 
intake and vasopressin release. This project tested the hypothesis that
angiotensin signaling at the subfornical organ (SFO) augments drinking behavior
in BDL rats. A genetically modified adeno-associated virus containing short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) for ANG II receptor subtype 1a (AT1aR) gene was microinjected
into the SFO of rats to knock down expression. Two weeks later, BDL or sham
surgery was performed. Rats were housed in metabolic chambers for measurement of 
fluid and food intake and urine output. The rats were euthanized 28 days after
BDL surgery for analysis. A group of rats was perfused for immunohistochemistry, 
and a second group was used for laser-capture microdissection for analysis of SFO
AT1aR gene expression. BDL rats showed increased water intake that was attenuated
in rats that received SFO microinjection of AT1aR shRNA. Among BDL rats treated
with scrambled (control) and AT1aR shRNA, we observed an increased number of
vasopressin-positive cells in the supraoptic nucleus that colocalized with <U+0394>FosB 
staining, suggesting increased vasopressin release in both groups. These results 
indicate that angiotensin signaling through the SFO contributes to increased
water intake, but not dilutional hyponatremia, during congestive liver failure.

Tissue sampling for gene expression analysis is usually performed under general
anesthesia. Anesthetics are known to modulate hemodynamics, receptor-mediated
signaling cascades, and outcome parameters. The present study determined the
influence of anesthetic paradigms typically used for euthanization and tissue
sampling on cerebral mRNA expression in mice. Naïve mice and animals with acute
traumatic brain injury induced by controlled cortical impact (CCI) were
randomized to the following euthanasia protocols (n=10-11/group): no anesthesia
(NA), 1<U+2009>min of 4<U+2009>vol% isoflurane in room air (ISO), 3<U+2009>min of a combination of
5<U+2009>mg/kg midazolam, 0.05<U+2009>mg/kg fentanyl, and 0.5<U+2009>mg/kg medetomidine
intraperitoneally (COMB), or 3<U+2009>min of 360<U+2009>mg/kg chloral hydrate intraperitoneally
(CH). mRNA expression of actin-1-related gene (Act1), FBJ murine osteosarcoma
viral oncogene homolog B (FosB), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), heat shock
protein beta-1 (HspB1), interleukin (IL)-6, tight junction protein 1 (ZO-1),
IL-1ß, cyclophilin A, micro RNA 497 (miR497), and small cajal body-specific RNA
17 were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in hippocampus
samples. In naïve animals, Act1 expression was downregulated in the CH group
compared with NA. FosB expression was downregulated in COMB and CH groups
compared with NA. CCI reduced Act1 and FosB expression, whereas HspB1 and TNFa
expression increased. After CCI, HspB1 expression was significantly higher in
ISO, COMB, and CH groups, and TNFa expression was elevated in ISO and COMB
groups. MiR497, IL-6, and IL-1ß were upregulated after CCI but not affected by
anesthetics. Effects were independent of absolute mRNA copy numbers. The data
demonstrate that a few minutes of anesthesia before tissue sampling are
sufficient to induce immediate mRNA changes, which seem to predominate in the
early-regulated gene cluster. Anesthesia-related effects on gene expression might
explain limited reproduciblity of real-time PCR data between studies or research 
groups and should therefore be considered for quantitative PCR data.

GOAL: To investigate the effect of luteolin on methamphetamine (MA)-induced
behavioral sensitization and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal
transduction pathway activation in mice.
METHODS: Mice received a single dose of MA to induce hyperactivity or repeated
intermittent intraperitoneal injections of MA to establish an MA-induced
behavioral sensitization mouse model. The effect of luteolin on the development
and expression of MA-induced hyperactivity and behavioral sensitization was
examined. The expression and activity of <U+0394>FosB and the levels of phosphorylated
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK1/2), phosphorylated c-Jun
N-terminal kinase (pJNK), and phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(pp38) in the caudate putamen (CPu) were measured by western blot.
RESULTS: Luteolin significantly decreased hyperactivity as well as the
development and expression of MA-induced behavioral sensitization in mice. <U+0394>FosB,
pERK1/2, and pJNK levels in the CPu were higher in MA-treated mice than in
control mice, whereas the pp38 level did not change. Injection of luteolin
inhibited the MA-induced increase in <U+0394>FosB, pERK1/2, and pJNK levels, but did not

CONCLUSIONS: Luteolin inhibits MA-induced hyperactivity and behavioral
sensitization in mice through the ERK1/2/<U+0394>FosB pathway. Furthermore, the JNK
signaling pathway might be involved in MA-induced neurodegeneration in the CPu,
and luteolin inhibits this process.

BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that the expression of CBX7 is drastically
decreased in several human carcinomas and that its expression progressively
decreases with the appearance of a highly malignant phenotype. The aim of our
study has been to investigate the mechanism by which the loss of CBX7 expression 
may contribute to the emergence of a more malignant phenotype.
METHODS: We analyzed the gene expression profile of a thyroid carcinoma cell line
after the restoration of CBX7 and, then, analyzed the transcriptional regulation 
of identified genes. Finally, we evaluated the expression of CBX7 and regulated
genes in a panel of thyroid and lung carcinomas.
RESULTS: We found that CBX7 negatively or positively regulates the expression of 
several genes (such as SPP1, SPINK1, STEAP1, and FOS, FOSB, EGR1, respectively)
associated to cancer progression, by interacting with their promoter regions and 
modulating their transcriptional activity. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses in human 
thyroid and lung carcinoma tissues revealed a negative correlation between CBX7
and its down-regulated genes, while a positive correlation was observed with
up-regulated genes.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the loss of CBX7 expression might play a critical role
in advanced stages of carcinogenesis by deregulating the expression of specific
effector genes.

Vitamin A deficiency impairs spatial learning and memory: the mechanism of
abnormal CBP-dependent histone acetylation regulated by retinoic acid receptor
alpha.

Vitamin A (VA) is an essential micronutrient. Numerous studies have confirmed
that VA deficiency (VAD) leads to a decline in learning and memory function. Our 
previous studies have demonstrated that retinoic acid nuclear receptor a (RARa)
in the hippocampus plays a crucial role in learning and memory, but the exact
mechanism for this process is unclear. Epigenetic modifications, particularly
histone acetylation, are involved in nervous system development, learning and
memory function, and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Histone
acetyltransferases (HATs), such as CREB-binding protein (CBP), E1A-binding
protein p300 (p300), and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), are critical for
regulating memory function. The current study uses RARa and CBP as examples to
study the connections between the RA signaling pathway and histone acetylation
modification and to reveal the epigenetic mechanism in VAD-induced learning and
memory impairment. This study examined the expression of RARa, HATs, acetylated
histone H3/H4, and memory-related genes (Zif268, cFos, FosB), as well as the
interaction of RARa and CBP in the hippocampus of 8-week-old rats. Additionally, 
the changes shown in vivo were further assessed in primary cultured neurons with 
the inhibition or overexpression of RARa. We found significantly lower levels of 
histone acetylation in the VAD rats. Furthermore, this downregulation, which
impairs learning and memory, is induced by the dysregulation of CBP-dependent
histone acetylation that is mediated by RARa. This work provides a solid
theoretical foundation and experimental basis for the importance of ensuring
sufficient nutritional VA during pregnancy and early life to prevent impairments 
of learning and memory in adulthood.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have implicated the cyclic adenosine
monophosphate/protein kinase A pathway as well as FosB and dynorphin-B expression
mediated by dopamine D1 receptor stimulation in the development of
3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia. The magnitude of these
molecular changes correlates with the intensity of dyskinesias. The
calcium-binding protein downstream regulatory element antagonistic modulator
(DREAM) binds to regulatory element sites called DRE in the DNA and represses
transcription of target genes such as c-fos, fos-related antigen-2 (fra-2), and
prodynorphin. This repression is released by calcium and protein kinase A
activation. Dominant-active DREAM transgenic mice (daDREAM) and DREAM knockout
mice (DREAM(-/-)) were used to define the involvement of DREAM in dyskinesias.
METHODS: Dyskinesias were evaluated twice a week in mice with 6-hydroxydopamine
lesions during long-term L-DOPA (25 mg/kg) treatment. The impact of DREAM on
L-DOPA efficacy was evaluated using the rotarod and the cylinder test after the
establishment of dyskinesia and the molecular changes by immunohistochemistry and
Western blot.
RESULTS: In daDREAM mice, L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia was decreased throughout the 
entire treatment. In correlation with these behavioral results, daDREAM mice
showed a decrease in FosB, phosphoacetylated histone H3, dynorphin-B, and
phosphorylated glutamate receptor subunit, type 1 expression. Conversely, genetic
inactivation of DREAM potentiated the intensity of dyskinesia, and DREAM(-/-)
mice exhibited an increase in expression of molecular markers associated with
dyskinesias. The DREAM modifications did not affect the kinetic profile or
antiparkinsonian efficacy of L-DOPA therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: The protein DREAM decreases development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia
in mice and reduces L-DOPA-induced expression of FosB, phosphoacetylated histone 
H3, and dynorphin-B in the striatum. These data suggest that therapeutic
approaches that activate DREAM may be useful to alleviate L-DOPA-induced
dyskinesia without interfering with the therapeutic motor effects of L-DOPA.

Neuropathic pain is a form of pathological nociception that occurs in a
significant portion of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) patients, resulting in 
debilitating and often long-term physical and psychological burdens. While many
peripheral and central mechanisms have been implicated in neuropathic pain,
central sensitization of dorsal horn spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons is a major
underlying substrate. Furthermore, dysregulation of extracellular glutamate
homeostasis and chronic astrocyte activation play important underlying roles in
persistent hyperexcitability of these superficial dorsal horn neurons. To date,
central sensitization and astrocyte changes have not been characterized in
cervical SCI-induced neuropathic pain models, despite the fact that a major
portion of SCI patients suffer contusion trauma to cervical spinal cord. In this 
study, we have characterized 2 rat models of unilateral cervical contusion SCI
that behaviorally result in chronic persistence of thermal hyperalgesia in the
ipsilateral forepaw. In addition, we find that STT neurons are chronically
activated in both models when compared to laminectomy-only uninjured rats.
Finally, persistent astrocyte activation and significantly reduced expression of 
the major CNS glutamate transporter, GLT1, in superficial dorsal horn astrocytes 
are associated with both excitability changes in STT neurons and the neuropathic 
pain behavioral phenotype. In conclusion, we have characterized
clinically-relevant rodent models of cervical contusion-induced neuropathic pain 
that result in chronic activation of both STT neurons and astrocytes, as well as 
compromise in astrocyte glutamate transporter expression. These models can be
used as important tools to further study mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain
post-SCI and to test potential therapeutic interventions.

BACKGROUND: Maternal obesity is associated with unfavorable outcomes, which may
be reflected in the as yet undiscovered gene expression profiles of the umbilical
cord (UC).
METHODS: UCs from 12 lean (pregravid BMI < 24.9) and 10 overweight/obese
(pregravid BMI = 25) women without gestational diabetes were collected for gene
expression analysis using Human Primeview microarrays. Metabolic parameters were 
assayed in mother's plasma and cord blood.
RESULTS: Although offspring birth weight and adiposity (at 2 wk) did not differ
between groups, expression of 232 transcripts was affected in UC from
overweight/obese compared with those of lean mothers. Gene-set enrichment
analysis revealed an upregulation of genes related to metabolism, stimulus and
defense response, and inhibitory to insulin signaling in the overweight/obese
group. We confirmed that EGR1, periostin, and FOSB mRNA expression was induced in
UCs from overweight/obese mothers, while endothelin receptor B, KLF10, PEG3, and 
EGLN3 expression was decreased. Messenger RNA expression of EGR1, FOSB, MEST, and
SOCS1 were positively correlated (P < 0.05) with mother's first-trimester body
fat mass (%).
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a positive association between maternal obesity and 
changes in UC gene expression profiles favoring inflammation and insulin
resistance, potentially predisposing infants to develop metabolic dysfunction
later on in life.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor in adults 
with a dismal prognosis. Current therapy of surgical removal combined with
Temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation therapy only slightly prolongs the survival of
GBM patients. Thus, it is essential to elucidate mechanism underlying its highly 
malignant properties in order to develop efficacious therapeutic regimens. In
this study, we showed that progranulin (PGRN) was overexpressed in most GBM cell 
lines and the majority of human tumor samples. PGRN overexpression conferred GBM 
cells with tumorigenic properties and TMZ resistance by upregulating DNA repair
(PARP, ATM, BRCA1, Rad51, XRCC1 and so on) and cancer stemness (CD133, CD44,
ABCG2) genes, in part via an AP-1 transcription factor, specifically cFos/JunB.
Curcumin, an AP-1 inhibitor, was also found to regulate PGRN promoter activity
and expression including its downstream effectors aforementioned. These data
suggested a feedforward loop between PGRN signaling and AP-1. PGRN depletion
significantly decreased unlimited self-renewal and multilineage differentiation
and the malignant properties of GBMs cells S1R1, and enhanced their vulnerability
to TMZ. In addition, S1R1 depleted of PGRN also lost the ability to form tumor in
an orthotopic xenograft mouse model. In conclusion, PGRN had a critical role in
the pathogenesis and chemoresistance of GBM and functioned at the top of the
hierarchy of cellular machinery that modulates both DNA repair pathways and
cancer stemness. Our data suggest that a new strategy combining current regimens 
with compounds targeting PGRN/AP-1 loop like curcumin may significantly improve
the therapeutic outcome of GBM.

OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were (i) to determine the localisation of
activator protein (AP)-1 family members (cFos, FosB, cJun, JunB and JunD) in
human myometrium; and (ii) to determine the effect of human term labour on the
expression of AP-1 family of transcription factors in myometrium.
STUDY DESIGN: This localised the AP-1 family members cFos, FosB, cJun, JunB and
JunD in human myometrium was performed by immunohistochemistry. The effect of
term labour on the expression of these family members at the mRNA and protein
level was assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The effect of
pro-inflammatory stimuli on AP-1 transcriptional activity was assessed using a
luciferase assay in primary human myometrial cells.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemical expression of cFos, FosB, cJun, JunB and JunD were
all present in human myometrial tissue and displayed cytoplasmic staining. FosB
and JunD also displayed nuclear staining. Term labour was associated with an
increase in cFos and JunB mRNA and protein expression. On the other hand, JunD
mRNA and protein expression was decreased with labour. FosB mRNA was increased
with labour, but there was no change at the protein level. There was no change in
cJun mRNA or protein expression. AP-1 transcriptional activity was increased in
human myometrial cells by the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-a. There was,
however, no effect of the bacterial products lipopolysaccharide (LPS; TLR4
ligand), iE-DAP (NOD1 ligand), MDP (NOD2 ligand), FSL-1 (TLR2 ligand) or
flagellin (TLR5 ligand) on AP-1 transcriptional activity.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that human labour is associated with changes in AP-1
family members. Further studies are required to determine the exact role of the
AP-1 family members in myometrium.

Hypospadias is a congenital hypoplasia of the penis, with displacement of the
urethral opening along the ventral surface, and has been reported to be one of
the most common congenital anomalies, occurring in approximately 1:250 to 1:300
live births. As hypospadias is reported to be an easily diagnosed malformation at
the crossroads of genetics and environment, it is important to study the genetic 
component in order to elucidate its etiology. In this study, the gene expression 
profiles both in human hypospadias tissues and normal penile tissues were studied
by Human Gene Expression Array. Twenty-four genes were found to be upregulated.
Among these, ATF3 and CYR61 have been reported previously. Other genes that have 
not been previously reported were also found to be upregulated: BTG2, CD69, CD9, 
DUSP1, EGR1, EIF4A1, FOS, FOSB, HBEGF, HNRNPUL1, IER2, JUN, JUNB, KLF2, NR4A1,
NR4A2, PTGS2, RGS1, RTN4, SLC25A25, SOCS3 and ZFP36 (p <0.05). Further studies
including genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with expression studies in a
large patient group will help us for identifiying the candidate gene(s) in the
etiology of hypospadias.

Impulsivity is a behavioral trait frequently seen not only in drug-addicted
individuals but also in individuals who pathologically overeat. However, whether 
impulsivity predates the development of uncontrollable feeding is unknown. In
this study, we hypothesized that a high impulsivity trait precedes and confers
vulnerability for food addiction-like behavior. For this purpose, we trained ad
libitum-fed male Wistar rats in a differential reinforcement of low rates of
responding (DRL) task to select Low- and High-impulsive rats. Then, we allowed
Low- and High-impulsive rats to self-administer a highly palatable diet
(Palatable group) or a regular chow diet (Chow group) in 1-h daily sessions,
under fixed ratio (FR) 1, FR3, FR5, and under a progressive ratio (PR) schedules 
of reinforcement. In addition, we tested the compulsiveness for food in Low- and 
High-impulsive rats by measuring the food eaten in the aversive, open compartment
of a light/dark conflict test. Finally, we measured the expression of the
transcription factor <U+0394>FosB in the shell and the core of the nucleus accumbens,
which is a marker for neuroadaptive changes following addictive drug exposure.
The data we obtained demonstrate that impulsivity is a trait that predicts the
development of food addiction-like behaviors, including: (i) excessive intake,
(ii) heightened motivation for food, and (iii) compulsive-like eating, when rats 
are given access to highly palatable food. In addition, we show that the food
addiction phenotype in high impulsive subjects is characterized by an increased
expression of the transcription factor <U+0394>FosB in the nucleus accumbens shell.
These results reveal that impulsivity confers an increased propensity to develop 
uncontrollable overeating of palatable food.

Fosb gene products contribute to excitotoxic microglial activation by regulating 
the expression of complement C5a receptors in microglia.

The Fosb gene encodes subunits of the activator protein-1 transcription factor
complex. Two mature mRNAs, Fosb and <U+0394>Fosb, encoding full-length FOSB and <U+0394>FOSB
proteins respectively, are formed by alternative splicing of Fosb mRNA. Fosb
products are expressed in several brain regions. Moreover, Fosb-null mice exhibit
depressive-like behaviors and adult-onset spontaneous epilepsy, demonstrating
important roles in neurological and psychiatric disorders. Study of Fosb products
has focused almost exclusively on neurons; their function in glial cells remains 
to be explored. In this study, we found that microglia express equivalent levels 
of Fosb and <U+0394>Fosb mRNAs to hippocampal neurons and, using microarray analysis, we
identified six microglial genes whose expression is dependent on Fosb products.
Of these genes, we focused on C5ar1 and C5ar2, which encode receptors for
complement C5a. In isolated Fosb-null microglia, chemotactic responsiveness
toward the truncated form of C5a was significantly lower than that in wild-type
cells. Fosb-null mice were significantly resistant to kainate-induced seizures
compared with wild-type mice. C5ar1 mRNA levels and C5aR1 immunoreactivity were
increased in wild-type hippocampus 24 hours after kainate administration;
however, such induction was significantly reduced in Fosb-null hippocampus.
Furthermore, microglial activation after kainate administration was significantly
diminished in Fosb-null hippocampus, as shown by significant reductions in CD68
immunoreactivity, morphological change and reduced levels of Il6 and Tnf mRNAs,
although no change in the number of Iba-1-positive cells was observed. These
findings demonstrate that, under excitotoxicity, Fosb products contribute to a
neuroinflammatory response in the hippocampus through regulation of microglial
C5ar1 and C5ar2 expression.

Enhanced resistance to chemotherapy has been correlated with high levels of
Delta-Np73 (DNp73), an anti-apoptotic protein of the p53 tumor-suppressor family 
which inhibits the pro-apoptotic members such as p53 and TAp73. Although
genotoxic drugs have been shown to induce DNp73 degradation, lack of mechanistic 
understanding of this process precludes strategies to enhance the targeting of
DNp73 and improve treatment outcomes. Antizyme (Az) is a mediator of
ubiquitin-independent protein degradation regulated by the polyamine biosynthesis
pathway. We show here that acetylpolyamine oxidase (PAOX), a catabolic enzyme of 
this pathway, upregulates DNp73 levels by suppressing its degradation via the Az 
pathway. Conversely, downregulation of PAOX activity by siRNA-mediated knockdown 
or chemical inhibition leads to DNp73 degradation in an Az-dependent manner. PAOX
expression is suppressed by several genotoxic drugs, via selected members of the 
activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors, namely c-Jun, JunB and FosB,
which are required for stress-mediated DNp73 degradation. Finally, chemical- and 
siRNA-mediated inhibition of PAOX significantly reversed the resistant phenotype 
of DNp73-overexpressing cancer cells to genotoxic drugs. Together, these data
define a critical mechanism for the regulation of DNp73 abundance, and reveal
that inhibition of PAOX could widen the therapeutic index of cytotoxic drugs and 
overcome DNp73-mediated chemoresistance in tumors.

The endocannabinoid (ECB) system has emerged recently as a key mediator for
reward processing. It is well known that cannabinoids affect appetitive learning 
processes and can induce reinforcing and rewarding effects. However, the
involvement of the ECB system in hedonic aspects of reward-related behavior is
not completely understood. With the present study, we investigated the modulatory
role of the ECB system on hedonic perception, measured by the pleasure attenuated
startle (PAS) paradigm for a palatable food reward. Here, a conditioned odor is
thought to induce a pleasant affective state that attenuates an aversive
reflex-the acoustic startle response. Modulatory effects of the CB1 receptor
antagonist/inverse agonist SR1411716 and the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55<U+2009>212-2 on 
PAS were examined in rats. PAS was also measured in CB1 receptor knockout (KO)
and wild-type (WT) mice. Pharmacological inhibition as well as the absence of CB1
receptors was found to reduce PAS, whereas WIN 55<U+2009>212-2 administration increased 
PAS. Finally, presentation of a conditioned reward cue was found to induce
striatal FosB/<U+0394>FosB expression in WT mice, but not in KO mice, indicating a
reduced stimulation of reward-related brain regions in conditioned KO mice by
odor presentation. We here show that in addition to our previous studies in rats,
PAS may also serve as a valuable and suitable measure to assess hedonic
processing in mice. Our data further indicate that the ECB system, and in
particular CB1 receptor signaling, appears to be highly important for the
mediation of hedonic aspects of reward processing.

Environment enrichment conditions have important consequences on subsequent
vulnerability to drugs of abuse. The present work examined whether exposure to an
enriched environment (EE) decreases oral self-consumption of nicotine. Wistar
rats were housed either in a standard environment (SE, four rats per standard
cage) or in an EE during 60 days after weaning. EE consisted of eight animals
housed in larger cages containing a variety of objects such as boxes, toys, and
burrowing material that were changed three times a week. After this period,
animals were exposed to nicotine for 3 weeks, where animals chose freely between 
water and a nicotine solution (0.006% in water). Fluid consumption was evaluated 
on a daily basis. <U+0394>FosB immunohistochemistry in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus
accumbens was also performed. Rats of the EE group consumed less nicotine
solution (0.25±0.04 mg/kg/day) than SE rats (0.54±0.05 mg/kg/day). EE increased
the number of <U+0394>Fos-immunoreactive (<U+0394>Fos-ir) cells in the nucleus accumbens core
and shell and in the prefrontal cortex, compared with animals in the standard
condition. However, rats exposed to nicotine in the SE showed higher <U+0394>Fos-ir
cells in the nucleus accumbens core and shell than nonexposed rats. Nicotine
consumption did not modify <U+0394>Fos-ir cells in these brain areas in EE animals.
These results support the idea of a possible protective effect of the EE on
reward sensitivity and the development of an addictive behavior to nicotine.

Combined meta-analysis of systemic effects of allogeneic stem cell
transplantation and systemic sclerosis.

BACKGROUND: Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a major factor of
morbidity and mortality for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (aSCT). The skin
and internal organ involvement is the most common systemic complication of cGVHD 
and closely resembles systemic sclerosis (SSc). Circulating lymphocytes
characterize the autoimmune nature of both conditions. Therefore we hypothesized 
that the common clinical manifestation (systemic organ and skin injury) and the
common underlying players (lymphocytes) justify the combined meta-analysis of
these diseases.
RESULTS: The aSCT and SSc datasets were uploaded from Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO), a public functional genomics data repository. The available microarray
studies of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and isolated lymphocytes
were limited to well established microarray platforms (Affymetrix, Agilent,
Canvac, and Illumina) and experimental settings with =10 patients per group. The 
resulting pools of data were merged by unique gene identifier and analyzed by the
expression genome-wide association studies (eGWAS) coupled with the subtraction
of the cGVHD+ and cGVHD- molecular signatures. The eGWAS was applied to 47 and 50
lymphocyte profiles from aSCT and SSc patients, respectively. The identified 35
candidates were represented by 8 known cGVHD genes (including CXCR4, LTBR and
PML) and 28 new candidate genes (including SEPX1 and DNJGB1). The further mutual 
subtraction of cGVHD+ and cGVHD- candidates and pathway analysis identified a
list of 25 genes. Seven of these genes belong to the fibroblast development and
function pathway, consisting of the well known cGVHD genes CCND1, JUN, and FOS,
and the new molecular targets MMP2, FOSB, TNFAIP8, and DUSP1. These genes become 
primary candidates for a potential link of systemic effects of cGVHD and SSc.
CONCLUSIONS: We designed a new approach for meta-analysis by combining data from 
different diseases using common clinical manifestation as a linker. This allowed 
us to power up the insufficient standalone meta-analysis of aSCT microarray
studies, by adding SSc samples to the data pool. This new method has successfully
identified novel molecular targets for systemic effects of both aSCT and SSc. We 
believe that this approach is generalizable and can be applied to an array of
diseases with common clinical manifestations.

Association of FOS-like antigen 1 promoter polymorphism with podocyte foot
process effacement in immunoglobulin A nephropathy patients.

BACKGROUND: FOS has been implicated in the progression of renal disease including
IgAN. In this study, we investigated whether polymorphisms of FOS family genes
[FOS, FOSB, FOS-like antigen 1 (FOSL1), and FOSL2] were associated with
immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) and the clinical phenotypes of IgAN patients.
METHODS: We genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FOS family genes 
(rs2239615 and rs7101 for FOS, rs12373539 and rs2282695 for FOSB, rs637571 for
FOSL1, and rs925255 for FOSL2) using direct sequencing in 198 IgAN patients and
290 control subjects.
RESULTS: No SNPs were associated with IgAN; however, in the analysis of clinical 
phenotypes, we found that rs637571 of FOSL1 was associated with podocyte foot
process effacement of IgAN in additive (CT vs. TT vs. CC, P = 0.0031, OR = 2.08, 
95% CI = 1.27-3.40) and dominant models (CT/TT vs. CC, P = 0.0034, OR = 2.50, 95%
CI = 1.35-4.64). The frequency of genotypes containing the T allele was increased
in IgAN patients with podocyte foot process effacement, compared to those without
podocyte foot process effacement.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that FOSL1 may be related to IgAN severity.

BACKGROUND: Gastrodia elata Blume (GEB), commonly used medicinal herb, has been
reported as a promising candidate for neurodegenerative diseases such as
Parkinson's disease. The dopamine precursor, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine
(L-DOPA), is the gold-standard drug for Parkinson's disease, but long-term
treatment results in the L-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). This study was
undertaken to examine the beneficial effects of GEB on L-DOPA induced dyskinesia 
in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced experimental Parkinsonism.
METHODS: We tested the effects of GEB on LID in 6-hydroxydopamine
hydrochloride-hemiparkinsonian mice. To analyze the dyskinetic anomalies, we
measured abnormal involuntary movement (AIM). Immunohistological analyses of pERK
and FosB expressions in the striatum are performed to explore the mechanism of
GEB on LID.
RESULTS: The finding of this study demonstrated that GEB (200, 400 and 800 mg/kg)
alleviated L-dopa induced AIMs in a dose-dependent manner. In each integrative
AIM subtype analysis, we also found that the GEB (400 and 800 mg/kg) treatment
decreased L-DOPA-induced axial, limb, orolingual, and locomotive AIMs compared to
the LID group. In addition, GEB normalized the abnormal LID-induced increase of
pERK1/2 and FosB, the immediate early genes of LID in the striatum.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our results provide a novel insight into the
pharmacological actions of GEB that could have a benefit for PD patients through 
the reduction of LID.

hemi-parkinsonian rodent model.

BACKGROUND: Dyskinesia or abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) are a disabling
effect of chronic L-DOPA administration and consequent pulsatile stimulation of
dopamine receptors. This abnormal activation causes maladaptive changes including
upregulation of FosB expression in dynorphin containing striatal cells. Substance
P (SP) is co-localized within dynorphin positive cells and is increased within
the substantia nigra by L-DOPA (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) treatment.
Accordingly, we determined if treatment with a SP NK1 receptor antagonist reduced
the onset of L-DOPA induced dyskinesia (LID) in the hemi-parkinsonian rodent
model.
METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent unilateral 6-OHDA
(6-hydroxydopamine-hydrobromide) lesions of the medial forebrain bundle. At day
21, daily administration commenced of either L-DOPA (6 mg/kg plus 15 mg/kg of
benseraside), L-DOPA with the NK1 antagonist N-acetyl-L-tryptophan (NAT) or equal
volume of saline. Animals were tested with the rodent AIM scale assessing axial, 
contralateral forelimb and orolingual AIMs. Assessment of L-DOPA induced turning 
was undertaken, and motor function determined using the accelerating rotarod and 
adjusting step test. Dopaminergic neuronal counts and immunoreactivity for SP and
FosB were undertaken.
RESULTS: All animals treated with L-DOPA alone developed dyskinesia, whereas
combined administration of NAT with L-DOPA significantly reduced onset of AIMs
and prevented mild to moderate dyskinesia. In non-dyskinetic NAT treated animals,
similar numbers of FosB+ striatal cells were recorded as in saline treated
animals. Importantly NAT treatment did not interfere with the anti-parkinsonian
effect of L-DOPA.
CONCLUSION: Daily administration of a SP NK1 receptor antagonist may represent a 
novel treatment regime that reduces the onset of LID whilst conserving motor
function.

Decreased medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neuronal activity is associated with
social defeat-induced depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in mice. However,
the molecular mechanisms underlying the decreased mPFC activity and its
prodepressant role remain unknown. We show here that induction of the
transcription factor <U+0394>FosB in mPFC, specifically in the prelimbic (PrL) area,
mediates susceptibility to stress. <U+0394>FosB induction in PrL occurred selectively in
susceptible mice after chronic social defeat stress, and overexpression of <U+0394>FosB 
in this region, but not in the nearby infralimbic (IL) area, enhanced stress
susceptibility. <U+0394>FosB produced these effects partly through induction of the
cholecystokinin (CCK)-B receptor: CCKB blockade in mPFC induces a resilient
phenotype, whereas CCK administration into mPFC mimics the anxiogenic- and
depressant-like effects of social stress. We previously found that optogenetic
stimulation of mPFC neurons in susceptible mice reverses several behavioral
abnormalities seen after chronic social defeat stress. Therefore, we hypothesized
that optogenetic stimulation of cortical projections would rescue the
pathological effects of CCK in mPFC. After CCK infusion in mPFC, we
optogenetically stimulated mPFC projections to basolateral amygdala or nucleus
accumbens, two subcortical structures involved in mood regulation. Stimulation of
corticoamygdala projections blocked the anxiogenic effect of CCK, although no
effect was observed on other symptoms of social defeat. Conversely, stimulation
of corticoaccumbens projections reversed CCK-induced social avoidance and sucrose
preference deficits but not anxiogenic-like effects. Together, these results
indicate that social stress-induced behavioral deficits are mediated partly by
molecular adaptations in mPFC involving <U+0394>FosB and CCK through cortical
projections to distinct subcortical targets.

Dyskinesia is a major side effect of an otherwise effective L-DOPA treatment in
Parkinson's patients. The prevailing view for the underlying presynaptic
mechanism of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) suggests that surges in dopamine
(DA) via uncontrolled release from serotonergic terminals results in abnormally
high level of extracellular striatal dopamine. Here we used high-sensitivity
online microdialysis and PET imaging techniques to directly investigate DA
release properties from serotonergic terminals both in the parkinsonian striatum 
and after neuronal transplantation in 6-OHDA lesioned rats. Although L-DOPA
administration resulted in a drift in extracellular DA levels, we found no
evidence for abnormally high striatal DA release from serotonin neurons. The
extracellular concentration of DA remained at or below levels detected in the
intact striatum. Instead, our results showed that an inefficient release pool of 
DA associated with low D2 receptor binding remained unchanged. Taken together,
these findings suggest that differential DA receptor activation rather than
excessive release could be the underlying mechanism explaining LID seen in this
model. Our data have important implications for development of drugs targeting
the serotonergic system to reduce DA release to manage dyskinesia in patients
with Parkinson's disease.

Gestational exposure to environmental toxins such as nicotine may result in
detectable gene expression changes in later life. To investigate the direct toxic
effects of prenatal nicotine exposure on later brain development, we have used
transcriptomic analysis of striatal samples to identify gene expression
differences between adolescent Lister Hooded rats exposed to nicotine in utero
and controls. Using an additional group of animals matched for the reduced food
intake experienced in the nicotine group, we were also able to assess the impact 
of imposed food-restriction on gene expression profiles. We found little evidence
for a role of gestational nicotine exposure on altered gene expression in the
striatum of adolescent offspring at a significance level of p<0.01 and |log2 fold
change >0.5|, although we cannot exclude the possibility of nicotine-induced
changes in other brain regions, or at other time points. We did, however, find
marked gene expression differences in response to imposed food-restriction.
Food-restriction resulted in significant group differences for a number of
immediate early genes (IEGs) including Fos, Fosb, Fosl2, Arc, Junb, Nr4a1 and
Nr4a3. These genes are associated with stress response pathways and therefore may
reflect long-term effects of nutritional deprivation on the development of the
stress system.

The effectiveness of fosfomycin was examined across 31 methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) strains by agar dilution. Prevalence of
the fosfomycin-resistance determinant gene, fosB, was assessed by PCR analysis.
Results found that 84% of isolates were fosfomycin-susceptible. Interestingly,
87% of isolates possessed fosB, indicating no association between this putative
staphylococci resistance gene and phenotypic resistance. Further evaluation of
fosfomycin as a potential treatment of MRSP in dogs is warranted.

Although adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) show promise for cell therapy, there
is a tremendous need for developing ASC activators. In the present study, we
investigated whether or not vitamin C increases the survival, proliferation, and 
hair-regenerative potential of ASCs. In addition, we tried to find the molecular 
mechanisms underlying the vitamin C-mediated stimulation of ASCs.
Sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2) is expressed in ASCs, and
mediates uptake of vitamin C into ASCs. Vitamin C increased the survival and
proliferation of ASCs in a dose-dependent manner. Vitamin C increased ERK1/2
phosphorylation, and inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathway attenuated the proliferation of ASCs. Microarray and quantitative
polymerase chain reaction showed that vitamin C primarily upregulated expression 
of proliferation-related genes, including Fos, E2F2, Ier2, Mybl1, Cdc45, JunB,
FosB, and Cdca5, whereas Fos knock-down using siRNA significantly decreased
vitamin C-mediated ASC proliferation. In addition, vitamin C-treated ASCs
accelerated the telogen-to-anagen transition in C3H/HeN mice, and conditioned
medium from vitamin C-treated ASCs increased the hair length and the
Ki67-positive matrix keratinocytes in hair organ culture. Vitamin C increased the
mRNA expression of HGF, IGFBP6, VEGF, bFGF, and KGF, which may mediate hair
growth promotion. In summary, vitamin C is transported via SVCT2, and increased
ASC proliferation is mediated by the MAPK pathway. In addition, vitamin C
preconditioning enhanced the hair growth promoting effect of ASCs. Because
vitamin C is safe and effective, it could be used to increase the yield and
regenerative potential of ASCs.

BACKGROUND: Chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) produces persistent behavioral
adaptations in mice. In many behavioral assays, it can be difficult to determine 
if these adaptations reflect core signs of depression. We designed studies to
characterize the effects of CSDS on sensitivity to reward because anhedonia
(reduced sensitivity to reward) is a defining characteristic of depressive
disorders in humans. We also examined the effects of striatal <U+0394>FosB
overexpression and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine, both of
which promote resilience, on CSDS-induced alterations in reward function and
social interaction.
METHODS: Intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) was used to quantify CSDS-induced
changes in reward function. Mice were implanted with lateral hypothalamic
electrodes, and ICSS thresholds were measured after each of 10 daily CSDS
sessions and during a 5-day recovery period. We also examined if acute
intraperitoneal administration of ketamine (2.5-20 mg/kg) reverses CSDS-induced
effects on reward or, in separate mice, social interaction.
RESULTS: ICSS thresholds were increased by CSDS, indicating decreases in the
rewarding impact of lateral hypothalamic stimulation (anhedonia). This effect was
attenuated in mice overexpressing <U+2206>FosB in striatum, consistent with
pro-resilient actions of this transcription factor. High, but not low, doses of
ketamine administered after completion of the CSDS regimen attenuated social
avoidance in defeated mice, although this effect was transient. Ketamine did not 
block CSDS-induced anhedonia in the ICSS test.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found that CSDS triggers persistent anhedonia and
confirms that <U+0394>FosB overexpression produces stress resilience. The findings of
this study also indicate that acute administration of ketamine fails to attenuate
CSDS-induced anhedonia despite reducing other depression-related behavioral
abnormalities.

Structure and function of the genomically encoded fosfomycin resistance enzyme,
FosB, from Staphylococcus aureus.

The Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of global
morbidity and mortality. Like many multi-drug-resistant organisms, S. aureus
contains antibiotic-modifying enzymes that facilitate resistance to a multitude
of antimicrobial compounds. FosB is a Mn(2+)-dependent fosfomycin-inactivating
enzyme found in S. aureus that catalyzes nucleophilic addition of either
l-cysteine (l-Cys) or bacillithiol (BSH) to the antibiotic, resulting in a
modified compound with no bactericidal properties. The three-dimensional X-ray
crystal structure of FosB from S. aureus (FosB(Sa)) has been determined to a
resolution of 1.15 Å. Cocrystallization of FosB(Sa) with either l-Cys or BSH
results in a disulfide bond between the exogenous thiol and the active site Cys9 
of the enzyme. An analysis of the structures suggests that a highly conserved
loop region of the FosB enzymes must change conformation to bind fosfomycin.
While two crystals of FosB(Sa) contain Zn(2+) in the active site, kinetic
analyses of FosB(Sa) indicated that the enzyme is inhibited by Zn(2+) for l-Cys
transferase activity and only marginally active for BSH transferase activity.
Fosfomycin-treated disk diffusion assays involving S. aureus Newman and the
USA300 JE2 methicillin-resistant S. aureus demonstrate a marked increase in the
sensitivity of the organism to the antibiotic in either the BSH or FosB null
strains, indicating that both are required for survival of the organism in the
presence of the antibiotic. This work identifies FosB as a primary
fosfomycin-modifying pathway of S. aureus and establishes the enzyme as a
potential therapeutic target for increased efficacy of fosfomycin against the
pathogen.

Ethanol conditioned place preference and alterations in <U+0394>FosB following
adolescent nicotine administration differ in rats exhibiting high or low
behavioral reactivity to a novel environment.

This study determined the effects of adolescent nicotine administration on adult 
alcohol preference in rats exhibiting high or low behavioral reactivity to a
novel environment, and ascertained whether nicotine altered <U+0394>FosB in the ventral 
striatum (vStr) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) immediately after drug administration
or after rats matured to adulthood. Animals were characterized as exhibiting high
(HLA) or low (LLA) locomotor activity in the novel open field on postnatal day
(PND) 31 and received injections of saline (0.9%) or nicotine (0.56 mg free
base/kg) from PND 35 to 42. Ethanol-induced conditioned place preference (CPP)
was assessed on PND 68 following 8 days conditioning in a biased paradigm; <U+0394>FosB 
was measured on PND 43 or PND 68. Following adolescent nicotine exposure, HLA
animals demonstrated a CPP when conditioned with ethanol; LLA animals were
unaffected. Further, adolescent nicotine exposure for 8 days increased levels of 
<U+0394>FosB in limbic regions in both HLA and LLA rats, but this increase persisted
into adulthood only in LLA animals. Results indicate that adolescent nicotine
exposure facilitates the establishment of an ethanol CPP in HLA rats, and that
sustained elevations in <U+0394>FosB are not necessary or sufficient for the
establishment of an ethanol CPP in adulthood. These studies underscore the
importance of assessing behavioral phenotype when determining the behavioral and 
cellular effects of adolescent nicotine exposure.

Gene expression profile of compressed primary human cementoblasts before and
after IL-1ß stimulation.

OBJECTIVES: Root resorptions due to a reduced repair function of cementoblasts
are common side effects during orthodontic tooth movement (OTM). The mechanisms, 
which lead to an impaired cementoblast function, are not fully understood.
Therefore, we aimed to investigate changes in the gene expression of
cementoblasts during mechanical stimulus under inflammatory conditions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human primary cementoblasts (HPCB) were exposed to
compression for 6 h or stimulation with IL-1ß for 96 h and subsequent 6 h
compression. Genome-wide expression analysis was performed using microarray
analysis. Prominent gene expression alterations (COX2, AXUD1, FOSB, CCL2, IFI6,
and PTGES) were verified by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) in two HPCB
populations. A caspase 3/7 activity assay was used to determine caspase-3 and
caspase-7 activity in stressed cells.
RESULTS: Gene expression cluster analysis revealed apoptosis as an important
process induced under both conditions. Apoptosis (pro- and anti-apoptotic)
related gene expression was most relevant after pro-inflammatory stimulation and 
compression. qRT-PCR analysis confirmed significant up-regulation of COX2, AXUD1,
and FOSB in both HPCB populations after compression, while selected genes
significantly increased after pro-inflammatory stimulation and compression.
Compression of cementoblasts increased caspase. The combination of
pro-inflammatory stimulation and compression led to a slightly smaller increase
of caspase activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Gene ontology analysis showed that compressed HPCB up-regulate genes
that are associated with apoptosis. Combining compression with a pro-inflammatory
stimulus (IL-1ß) augmented the positive regulation of apoptosis-related pathways.
The induction of apoptosis related gene expression (pro- and anti-apoptotic
genes) in cementoblasts suggests an involvement of apoptosis in cementoblast
regulation during OTM.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: As apoptosis is induced in HPCB after compression and
inflammation, it is conceivable that HPCB cell death might contribute to root
resorptions due to a loss of repair activity of cementoblasts. Further studies
should be conducted to clarify the implication of the identified genes on root
resorptions in order to develop therapeutic strategies to prevent a shortening of
roots.

Early poststroke rehabilitation effectively improves recovery of function, likely
by engaging multiple plasticity processes through use-dependent activation of
neural circuits. The loci of such neuroplastic reorganization have not been
examined during the initial phase of behavioral recovery. In the current study,
we sought to evaluate sub-components of rehabilitation and to identify brain
sites first engaged by early rehabilitation. Rats were subjected to endothelin-1 
ischemia and placed in either enriched environment (EE), daily reach training
(RT), combination of enriched environment and reach training (ER), or standard
housing (ST) starting 7 days post ischemia. Functional and histopathological
assessments were made after 2, 5, and 10 days of treatment. Animals exposed to 10
days of ER treatment exhibited significantly more use-dependent neuronal activity
(FosB/<U+0394>FosB expression) in perilesional cortex than those exposed to EE, RT, or
ST treatments. Similar trends were observed in both perilesional striatum and
contralesional forelimb motor cortex. This use-dependent plasticity was not
explained by differences in neuronal death, inflammation, or lesion volume. The
increased activity likely contributes to the neuroplastic changes and functional 
recovery observed after extended periods of rehabilitation. Importantly, EE or RT
alone did not lead to enhanced activity suggesting that combination therapy is
necessary to promote maximum recovery.

The presence and characterisation of plasmid-mediated fosfomycin resistance
determinants were investigated among 45 clinical vancomycin-resistant enterococci
(VRE) isolated in Zhejiang Province, China. In total, 19 VRE were resistant to
fosfomycin, of which 18 isolates had conjugative fosfomycin resistance and were
positive for fosB. No reported fos genes were detected in the remaining isolate. 
Among the 18 fosB-carrying isolates, the fosB gene was always flanked by tnpA,
suggesting the same novel fosB transposon. In 10 of the 18 fosB-carrying
isolates, the fosB and tnpA genes were found reversely inserted in the vanA
transposon Tn1546. In the remaining eight isolates the fosB and vanA genes were
located on different plasmids. These findings indicate that acquisition of the
conjugative plasmid harbouring the novel fosB transposon (ISL3-like transposon)
and the Tn1546-like transposon (containing vanA and fosB) may explain, at least
in part, the recent increase in fosfomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in
China.

The FOS transcription factor family differentially controls trophoblast migration
and invasion.

Extravillous trophoblast invasion is a fundamental component of human
placentation. Invading trophoblast cells promote blood flow to the conceptus by
actively remodeling the uterine vasculature. The extent of trophoblast invasion
is tightly regulated; aberrant invasion is linked with several obstetrical
complications. However, the transcriptional networks responsible for controlling 
the extent of trophoblast invasion are not well defined. Previous studies have
identified high levels of FOS (FOS, FOSB, FOS-like (FOSL) 1, and FOSL2) proteins 
in extravillous trophoblast cells. These proteins form part of the activating
protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex and are implicated in regulating
gene networks controlling cellular invasion in diverse biological systems.
Therefore, we hypothesized that FOS family proteins play a role in regulating
trophoblast invasion. We assessed expression of FOS family proteins in
trophoblast cell lines and human placentae at different gestational ages. FOS,
FOSB, and FOSL1 proteins were robustly increased in trophoblast cells subject to 
wound-based migration assays as well as Matrigel-based invasion assays. FOS
knockdown resulted in cessation of proliferation and an induction of migration
and invasion concomitant with robust expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)
1, MMP3, and MMP10. Conversely, FOSL1 knockdown abrogated trophoblast migration
and invasion and inhibited the production of MMP1, MMP3, and MMP10. In human
placenta, FOS was expressed in proximal anchoring villi in conjunction with
phospho-ERK. FOSL1 was temporally expressed only in the distal-most extravillous 
trophoblast cells, which represent a migratory cell population. Therefore, FOS
and FOSL1 exert opposing effects on trophoblast invasion.

Pseudomyogenic haemangioendothelioma (PHE) is an intermediate malignant vascular 
soft tissue tumour primarily affecting children and young adults. The molecular
basis of this neoplasm is unknown. We here used chromosome banding analysis,
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), mRNA sequencing, RT-PCR and
quantitative real-time PCR on a series of morphologically well-characterized PHEs
to show that a balanced translocation, t(7;19)(q22;q13), detected as the sole
cytogenetic aberration in two cases, results in fusion of the SERPINE1 and FOSB
genes. This translocation has not been observed in any other bone or soft tissue 
tumour. Interphase FISH on sections from eight additional PHEs identified the
same SERPINE1-FOSB fusion in all cases. The role of SERPINE1, which is highly
expressed in vascular cells, in this gene fusion is probably to provide a strong 
promoter for FOSB, which was found to be expressed at higher levels in PHEs than 
in other soft tissue tumours. FOSB encodes a transcription factor belonging to
the FOS family of proteins, which, together with members of the JUN family of
transcription factors, are major components of the activating protein 1 (AP-1)
complex. Further studies are needed to understand the cellular impact of the
aberrant expression of the FOSB gene, but as the t(7;19) resulting in the
SERPINE1-FOSB fusion seems to be pathognomonic for PHE, FISH or RT-PCR could be
useful for differential diagnostic purposes.

Chronic drug exposure and drug withdrawal induce expressive neuronal plasticity
which could be considered as both functional and pathological responses. It is
well established that neuronal plasticity in the limbic system plays a pivotal
role in relapse as well as in compulsive characteristics of drug addiction.
Although increases in FosB/DeltaFosB expression constitute one of the most
important forms of neuronal plasticity in drug addiction, it is unclear whether
they represent functional or pathological plasticity. It is of noteworthy
importance the individual differences in the transition from recreational use to 
drug addiction. These differences have been reported in studies involving the
ethanol-induced locomotor sensitization paradigm. In the present study we
investigated whether sensitized and non-sensitized mice differ in terms of
FosB/DeltaFosB expression. Adult male outbred Swiss mice were daily treated with 
ethanol or saline for 21 days. According to the locomotor activity in the
acquisition phase, they were classified as sensitized (EtOH_High) or
non-sensitized (EtOH_Low). After 18 h or 5 days, their brains were processed for 
FosB/DeltaFosB immunohistochemistry. On the 5th day of withdrawal, we could
observe increased FosB/DeltaFosB expression in the EtOH_High group (in the motor 
cortex), in the EtOH_Low group (in the ventral tegmental area), and in both
groups (in the striatum). Differences were more consistent in the EtOH_Low group.
Therefore, behavioral variability observed in the acquisition phase of
ethanol-induced locomotor sensitization was accompanied by differential neuronal 
plasticity during withdrawal period. Furthermore, distinct patterns of
FosB/DeltaFosB expression detected in sensitized and non-sensitized mice seem to 
be more related to withdrawal period rather than to chronic drug exposure.
Finally, increases in FosB/DeltaFosB expression during withdrawal period could be
considered as being due to both functional and pathological plasticity.

Knockdown of tropomyosin-related kinase B receptor expression in the nucleus
accumbens shell prevents intermittent social defeat stress-induced
cross-sensitization to amphetamine in rats.

The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a critical brain region for the rewarding effects 
of drugs of abuse. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can facilitate
stress- and drug-induced neuroadaptation in the mesocorticolimbic system.
BDNF-containing projections to the NAc originate from the ventral tegmental area 
(VTA) and the prefrontal cortex, and BDNF release activates tropomyosin-related
kinase B (TrkB). In this study, we examined the necessity for BDNF-TrkB signaling
in the NAc shell during social defeat stress-induced cross-sensitization to
amphetamine. Adeno-associated virus expressing short hairpin RNA directed against
TrkB (AAV-shTrkB) was infused bilaterally into the NAc shell to knock down TrkB, 
whereas AAV-GFP (green fluorescent protein) was used as the control virus. Rats
were exposed to intermittent social defeat stress or handling procedures;
amphetamine challenge was given at 10 days after the last defeat and locomotor
activity was measured. Stressed rats that received the control virus showed
cross-sensitization to amphetamine compared with the handled rats. In contrast,
NAc TrkB knockdown prevented social defeat stress-induced cross-sensitization.
TrkB knockdown in the NAc was found to reduce the level of phospho-extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase 1 in this region. NAc TrkB knockdown also prevented
stress-induced elevation of BDNF and the glutamate receptor type 1 (GluA1)
subunit of AMPA receptor in the VTA, as well as <U+0394>FosB expression in the NAc.
These findings indicated that BDNF-TrkB signaling in the NAc shell was required
for social defeat stress-induced cross-sensitization. NAc TrkB-BDNF signaling
also appeared to be involved in the regulation of GluA1 in the VTA, as well as in
the NAc <U+0394>FosB accumulation that could trigger cross-sensitization after social
defeat stress.

Dopamine replacement with l-DOPA is the most effective therapy in Parkinson's
disease. However, with chronic treatment, half of the patients develop an
abnormal motor response including dyskinesias. The specific molecular mechanisms 
underlying dyskinesias are not fully understood. In this study, we used a
well-characterized animal model to first establish the molecular differences
between rats that did and did not develop dyskinesias. We then investigated the
molecular substrates implicated in the anti-dyskinetic effect of buspirone, a
5HT1A partial agonist. Striatal protein expression profile of dyskinetic animals 
revealed increased levels of the dopamine receptor (DR)D3, <U+0394>FosB and phospho
(p)CREB, as well as an over-activation of the DRD1 signalling pathway, reflected 
by elevated ratios of phosphorylated DARPP32 and ERK2. Buspirone reduced the
abnormal involuntary motor response in dyskinetic rats in a dose-dependent
fashion. Buspirone (4 mg/kg) dramatically reduced the presence and severity of
dyskinesias (by 83%) and normalized DARPP32 and ERK2 phosphorylation ratios,
while the increases in DRD3, <U+0394>FosB and pCREB observed in dyskinetic rats were not
modified. Pharmacological experiments combining buspirone with 5HT1A and DRD3
antagonists confirmed that normalization of both pDARPP32 and pERK2 is required, 
but not sufficient, for blocking dyskinesias. The correlation between pDARPP32
ratio and dyskinesias was significant but not strong, pointing to the involvement
of convergent factors and signalling pathways. Our results suggest that in
dyskinetic rats DRD3 striatal over-expression could be instrumental in the
activation of DRD1-downstream signalling and demonstrate that the anti-dyskinetic
effect of buspirone in this model is correlated with DRD1 pathway normalization.

This study first showed the behavioural benefits of novel combination therapy of 
L-dopa with acupuncture on Parkinson's disease, and its underlying mechanisms
within basal ganglia. The previous study reported that acupuncture may improve
the motor function of a Parkinson's disease (PD) mouse model by increasing the
dopamine efflux and turnover ratio of dopamine. Hence, we hypothesised that
combining L-dopa with acupuncture would have a behavioural benefit for those with
PD. We performed unilateral injections of 6-OHDA into the striatum of C57Bl/6
mice to model hemi-Parkinsonian attributes. To test motor function and dyskinetic
anomalies, we examined cylinder behaviour and abnormal involuntary movement
(AIM), respectively. We found that (1) a 50% reduced dose of L-dopa (7.5 mg/kg)
combined with acupuncture showed an improvement in motor function that was
comparable to mice given the standard dose of L-dopa treatment (15 mg/kg) only,
and that (2) the combination treatment (L-dopa +acupuncture) was significantly
superior in reducing AIM scores when equivalent doses of L-dopa were used. The
combination treatment also significantly reduces the abnormal increase of GABA
contents in the substantia nigra compared to the standard L-dopa treatment.
Furthermore, abnormal expression of FosB, the immediate early gene of L-dopa
induced dyskinesia (LID), was mitigated in the striatum by the combination
treatment. All of these results indicate that acupuncture enhances the benefits
of L-dopa on motor function with reduced dose of L-dopa and alleviating LID by
normalising neurochemical imbalance within the basal ganglia.

The study was conducted to investigate the role for dopamine in the centrally
mediated sympathoexcitatory response in rats with Type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D was 
induced by a combination of high-fat diet (HFD) and low-dose streptozotocin
(STZ). HFD/STZ treatment for 12-14 wk resulted in significant increase in the
number of FosB-positive cells in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and rostral
ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). In anesthetized rats, administration of exogenous
dopamine (dopamine hydrochloride, 20 mM) in the PVN, but not in the RVLM,
elicited decreases in renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and mean arterial
pressure (MAP) in control rats and but not in the T2D rats. Blocking the
endogenous dopamine with dopamine D1/D5 receptor antagonist SCH39166 (2 mM) in
the PVN and RVLM, resulted in increases in RSNA, MAP, and heart rate (HR) in both
control and T2D rats. These responses were significantly attenuated in T2D rats
compared with control rats (PVN - <U+0394>RSNA: 21 ± 10 vs. 44 ± 2%; <U+0394>MAP: 7 ± 3 vs. 19 
± 6 mmHg, <U+0394>HR: 17 ± 5 vs. 32 ± 4 bpm, P < 0.05). There were no significant
increases in response to dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist raclopride
application in the PVN and RVLM of both control and T2D rats. Furthermore, there 
were decreased dopamine D1 receptor and D2 receptor expressions in the PVN of T2D
rats. Taken together, these data suggest that reduced endogenous dopaminergic
tone within the PVN may contribute to the sympathoexcitation in T2D.

Due to the increased application of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) in 
various areas, numerous studies have been conducted which have confirmed that
exposure to TiO2 NPs may result in neurological damage in both mice and rats.
However, very few studies have focused on the molecular mechanisms of spatial
recognition injury. In the present study, to understand the possible
neurobiological responses of the mouse hippocampus following subchronic peroral
exposure to low level TiO2 NPs, mice were exposed to 2.5, 5, and 10mg/kg body
weight TiO2 NPs for 90 consecutive days. Hippocampal pathology and neuron
ultrastructure, and long-term potentiation (LTP) were then evaluated, and the
hippocampal mRNA-expression of several genes and their proteins involved in
homeostasis of neuronal synaptic plasticity were investigated using a
quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA method. We observed that subchronic peroral 
exposure to TiO2 NPs caused severe pathological changes, spatial recognition
impairment, and resulted in significant LTP reduction and down-regulation of
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits (NR2A and NR2B) expression
associated with the simultaneous inhibition of CaMKIV, cyclic-AMP responsive
element binding proteins (CREB-1, CREB-2), and FosB/DFosB in mouse hippocampal
tissues. Therefore, our findings suggest that the application of TiO2 NPs in the 
various areas should be paid more attention.

Long-term exercise is a potent trigger for <U+0394>FosB induction in the hippocampus
along the dorso-ventral axis.

Physical exercise improves multiple aspects of hippocampal function. In line with
the notion that neuronal activity is key to promoting neuronal functions,
previous literature has consistently demonstrated that acute bouts of exercise
evoke neuronal activation in the hippocampus. Repeated activating stimuli lead to
an accumulation of the transcription factor <U+0394>FosB, which mediates long-term
neural plasticity. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that long-term
voluntary wheel running induces <U+0394>FosB expression in the hippocampus, and examined
any potential region-specific effects within the hippocampal subfields along the 
dorso-ventral axis. Male C57BL/6 mice were housed with or without a running wheel
for 4 weeks. Long-term wheel running significantly increased FosB/<U+0394>FosB
immunoreactivity in all hippocampal regions measured (i.e., in the DG, CA1, and
CA3 subfields of both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus). Results confirmed that
wheel running induced region-specific expression of FosB/<U+0394>FosB immunoreactivity
in the cortex, suggesting that the uniform increase in FosB/<U+0394>FosB within the
hippocampus is not a non-specific consequence of running. Western blot data
indicated that the increased hippocampal FosB/<U+0394>FosB immunoreactivity was
primarily due to increased <U+0394>FosB. These results suggest that long-term physical
exercise is a potent trigger for <U+0394>FosB induction throughout the entire
hippocampus, which would explain why exercise can improve both dorsal and ventral
hippocampus-dependent functions. Interestingly, we found that FosB/<U+0394>FosB
expression in the DG was positively correlated with the number of
doublecortin-immunoreactive (i.e., immature) neurons. Although the mechanisms by 
which <U+0394>FosB mediates exercise-induced neurogenesis are still uncertain, these
data imply that exercise-induced neurogenesis is at least activity dependent.
Taken together, our current results suggest that <U+0394>FosB is a new molecular target 
involved in regulating exercise-induced hippocampal plasticity.

Understanding gene regulatory networks controlling properties of pluripotent stem
cells will facilitate development of stem cell-based therapies. The transcription
factor Foxd3 is critical for maintenance of self-renewal, survival, and
pluripotency in murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Using a conditional deletion 
of Foxd3 followed by gene expression analyses, we demonstrate that genes required
for several developmental processes including embryonic organ development,
epithelium development, and epithelial differentiation were misregulated in the
absence of Foxd3. Additionally, we identified 6 novel targets of Foxd3 (Sox4,
Safb, Sox15, Fosb, Pmaip1 and Smarcd3). Finally, we present data suggesting that 
Foxd3 functions upstream of genes required for skeletal muscle development.
Together, this work provides further evidence that Foxd3 is a critical regulator 
of murine development through the regulation of lineage specific differentiation.

The transcription factor, <U+0394>FosB, is robustly and persistently induced in striatum
by several chronic stimuli, such as drugs of abuse, antipsychotic drugs, natural 
rewards, and stress. However, very few studies have examined the degree of <U+0394>FosB 
induction in the two striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes. We make use of 
fluorescent reporter BAC transgenic mice to evaluate induction of <U+0394>FosB in
dopamine receptor 1 (D1) enriched and dopamine receptor 2 (D2) enriched MSNs in
ventral striatum, nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell and core, and in dorsal striatum 
(dStr) after chronic exposure to several drugs of abuse including cocaine,
ethanol, <U+0394>(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, and opiates; the antipsychotic drug,
haloperidol; juvenile enrichment; sucrose drinking; calorie restriction; the
serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor antidepressant, fluoxetine; and social
defeat stress. Our findings demonstrate that chronic exposure to many stimuli
induces <U+0394>FosB in an MSN-subtype selective pattern across all three striatal
regions. To explore the circuit-mediated induction of <U+0394>FosB in striatum, we use
optogenetics to enhance activity in limbic brain regions that send synaptic
inputs to NAc; these regions include the ventral tegmental area and several
glutamatergic afferent regions: medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and ventral
hippocampus. These optogenetic conditions lead to highly distinct patterns of
<U+0394>FosB induction in MSN subtypes in NAc core and shell. Together, these findings
establish selective patterns of <U+0394>FosB induction in striatal MSN subtypes in
response to chronic stimuli and provide novel insight into the circuit-level
mechanisms of <U+0394>FosB induction in striatum.

The Fos- and Jun family proteins are immediate-early gene products, and the
Fos/Jun heterodimer, activator protein-1 (AP-1), may be involved in the
regulation of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) gene expression. FosB is a
member of the Fos family proteins that is expressed in the paraventricular
nucleus of the hypothalamus upon stress exposure, but it has not been clear
whether FosB participates in the regulation of CRF gene expression. This study
aimed to explore the effect of the FosB and cJun proteins on CRF gene expression 
in rat hypothalamic 4B cells. The levels of FosB mRNA and cJun mRNA increased
following treatment with forskolin, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), or
A23187 in the hypothalamic cells. Overexpression of FosB or cJun potently
increased CRF mRNA levels. Furthermore, downregulation of FosB or cJun suppressed
the CRF gene expression induced by forskolin, PMA, or A23187. In addition, the
basal CRF mRNA levels were partially reduced by cJun downregulation. These
findings suggest that FosB, together with cJun, may mediate CRF gene expression
in the hypothalamic cells.

Chronic social defeat stress in mice produces a susceptible phenotype
characterized by several behavioral abnormalities consistent with human
depression that are reversed by chronic but not acute exposure to antidepressant 
medications. Recent work in addiction models demonstrates that the transcription 
factor <U+0394>FosB and protein kinase calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)
are co-regulated in nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain reward region implicated in 
both addiction and depression models including social defeat. Previous work has
also demonstrated that <U+0394>FosB is induced in NAc after chronic social defeat stress
or after chronic antidepressant treatment, wherein it mediates a pro-resilience
or antidepressant-like phenotype. Here, using chromatin immunoprecipitation
assays, we found that <U+0394>FosB binds the CaMKIIa gene promoter in NAc and that this 
binding increases after mice are exposed to chronic social defeat stress.
Paradoxically, chronic exposure to the antidepressant fluoxetine reduces binding 
of <U+0394>FosB to the CaMKIIa promoter and reduces CaMKII expression in NAc, despite
the fact that <U+0394>FosB is induced under these conditions. These data suggest a novel
epigenetic mechanism of antidepressant action, whereby fluoxetine induces some
chromatin change at the CaMKIIa promoter, which blocks the <U+0394>FosB binding. Indeed,
chronic fluoxetine reduces acetylation and increases lysine-9 dimethylation of
histone H3 at the CaMKIIa promoter in NAc, effects also seen in depressed humans 
exposed to antidepressants. Overexpression of CaMKII in NAc blocks fluoxetine's
antidepressant effects in the chronic social defeat paradigm, whereas inhibition 
of CaMKII activity in NAc mimics fluoxetine exposure. These findings suggest that
epigenetic suppression of CaMKIIa expression in NAc is behaviorally relevant and 
offer a novel pathway for possible therapeutic intervention in depression and
related syndromes.

Some VanM-type vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolates from China are 
also resistant to fosfomycin. To investigate the mechanism of fosfomycin
resistance in these clinical isolates, antimicrobial susceptibility testing,
filter-mating, Illumina/Solexa sequencing, inverse PCR and fosfomycin resistance 
gene cloning were performed. Three E. faecium clinical isolates were highly
resistant to fosfomycin and vancomycin with minimal inhibitory concentrations
(MICs) >1024 µg/ml and >256 µg/ml, respectively. The fosfomycin and vancomycin
resistance of these strains could be co-transferred by conjugation. They carried 
a fosfomycin resistance gene fosB encoding a protein differing by one or two
amino acids from FosB, which is encoded on staphylococcal plasmids. Accordingly, 
the gene was designated fosB3. The fosB3 gene was cloned into pMD19-T, and
transformed into E. coli DH5a. The fosfomycin MIC for transformants with fosB3
was 750-fold higher than transformants without fosB3. The fosB3 gene could be
transferred by an extrachromosomal circular intermediate. The results indicate
that the fosB3 gene is transferable, can mediate high level fosfomycin resistance
in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and can be located on a
circular intermediate.

Epilepsy is a relatively common and chronic neurological condition, affecting
1-2% of the population. However, understanding of the underlying pathophysiology 
remains incomplete. To identify potential factors in the early environment that
may increase the risk for experiencing seizures, maternal stress and
environmental enrichment (EE) were utilized. Pregnant Long-Evans rats were
exposed to an ethologically relevant predator stress (PS) and maternal
glucocorticoid (GC) response was assessed across the exposure period. At birth,
litters were divided into standard care (SC) and EE groups until postnatal day 14
(PD14) when a model of febrile convulsions was used to determine seizure
susceptibility of the various groups. Pup brains were then processed for
immunohistochemical detection of FosB from several structures in the limbic
system as a measure of neuronal activation. Maternal PS-induced GC levels were
elevated early in the exposure period, and pup birth weights, in both sexes, were
lower in litters from dams exposed to PS. Seizure scores at PD14 were highly
individualized and litter dependent, suggesting a dam-dependent and variable
effect of controlled pre- and postnatal environmental factors. Further, analysis 
of FosB-immunoreactive (-ir) patterns revealed an activity dependent
distribution, reflecting individual seizure susceptibility. EE had a varying
effect on FosB-ir that was dependent on region. In the hippocampus FosB-ir levels
were greater in the EE groups while extra-hippocampal regions showed lower levels
of FosB-ir. Our results support the concept that pre- and postnatal environmental
influences affect fetal programming and neurodevelopment of processes that could 
underlie seizure susceptibility, but that the magnitude of these effects appears 
to be dam- or litter-dependent.

Importance of bacillithiol in the oxidative stress response of Staphylococcus
aureus.

In Staphylococcus aureus, the low-molecular-weight thiol called bacillithiol
(BSH), together with cognate S-transferases, is believed to be the counterpart to
the glutathione system of other organisms. To explore the physiological role of
BSH in S. aureus, we constructed mutants with the deletion of bshA (sa1291),
which encodes the glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the first step of BSH
biosynthesis, and fosB (sa2124), which encodes a BSH-S-transferase that confers
fosfomycin resistance, in several S. aureus strains, including clinical isolates.
Mutation of fosB or bshA caused a 16- to 60-fold reduction in fosfomycin
resistance in these S. aureus strains. High-pressure liquid chromatography
analysis, which quantified thiol extracts, revealed some variability in the
amounts of BSH present across S. aureus strains. Deletion of fosB led to a
decrease in BSH levels. The fosB and bshA mutants of strain COL and a USA300
isolate, upon further characterization, were found to be sensitive to H2O2 and
exhibited decreased NADPH levels compared with those in the isogenic parents.
Microarray analyses of COL and the isogenic bshA mutant revealed increased
expression of genes involved in staphyloxanthin synthesis in the bshA mutant
relative to that in COL under thiol stress conditions. However, the bshA mutant
of COL demonstrated decreased survival compared to that of the parent in human
whole-blood survival assays; likewise, the naturally BSH-deficient strain SH1000 
survived less well than its BSH-producing isogenic counterpart. Thus, the
survival of S. aureus under oxidative stress is facilitated by BSH, possibly via 
a FosB-mediated mechanism, independently of its capability to produce
staphyloxanthin.

Effects of exercise training on SFO-mediated sympathoexcitation during chronic
heart failure.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cellular and Integrative Physiology, University of Nebraska
Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.

Exercise training (ExT) has been shown to reduce sympathetic drive during heart
failure (HF). The subfornical organ (SFO) is involved in the neural control of
sympathetic drive. We hypothesized that an activated SFO contributes to enhanced 
sympathetic activity in HF. We also postulated that ExT would reduce the
activation of the SFO and its contribution to the sympathetic drive during HF.
Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to coronary artery ligation to induce HF. Rats
were assigned to ExT for 3-4 wk. Rats with HF had a 2.5-fold increase in
FosB-positive cells in the SFO compared with sham-operated rats, and this was
normalized by ExT. Microinjection of ANG II (100 pmol) into the SFO resulted in a
greater increase in renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), blood pressure, and 
heart rate in the HF group than in the sham-operated group. These responses were 
normalized after ExT (change in RSNA: 23 ± 3% vs. 8 ± 2%). ExT also abolished the
decrease in RSNA in HF rats after the microinjection of losartan (200 pmol) into 
the SFO (-21 ± 4% vs. -2 ± 3%). Finally, there was elevated mRNA (5-fold) and
protein expression (43%) of ANG II type 1 receptors in the SFO of rats with HF,
which were reversed after ExT. These data suggest that the enhanced activity of
the SFO by elevated tonic ANG II contributes to the enhanced sympathoexcitation
exhibited in HF. The decrease in ANG II type 1 receptor expression in the SFO by 
ExT may be responsible for reversing the neuronal activation in the SFO and
SFO-mediated sympathoexcitation in rats with HF.

GDNF-independent ureteric budding: role of PI3K-independent activation of AKT and
FOSB/JUN/AP-1 signaling.

A significant fraction of mice deficient in either glial cell-derived
neurotrophic factor (GDNF) or its co-receptors (Gfra1, Ret), undergoes ureteric
bud (UB) outgrowth leading to the formation of a rudimentary kidney. Previous
studies using the isolated Wolffian duct (WD) culture indicate that activation of
fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor signaling, together with suppression of
BMP/Activin signaling, is critical for GDNF-independent WD budding (Maeshima et
al., 2007). By expression analysis of embryonic kidney from Ret((-/-)) mice, we
found the upregulation of several FGFs, including FGF7. To examine the
intracellular pathways, we then analyzed GDNF-dependent and GDNF-independent
budding in the isolated WD culture. In both conditions, Akt activation was found 
to be important; however, whereas this occurred through PI3-kinase in
GDNF-dependent budding, in the case of GDNF-independent budding, Akt activation
was apparently via a PI3-kinase independent mechanism. Jnk signaling and the AP-1
transcription factor complex were also implicated in GDNF-independent budding.
FosB, a binding partner of c-Jun in the formation of AP-1, was the most highly
upregulated gene in the ret knockout kidney (in which budding had still
occurred), and we found that its siRNA-mediated knockdown in isolated WDs also
blocked GDNF-independent budding. Taken together with the finding that inhibition
of Jnk signaling does not block Akt activation/phosphorylation in
GDNF-independent budding, the data support necessary roles for both FosB/Jun/AP-1
signaling and PI3-kinase-independent activation of Akt in GDNF-independent
budding. A model is proposed for signaling events that involve Akt and JNK
working to regulate GDNF-independent WD budding.

The long-term use of levodopa (L-DOPA) in Parkinson's disease (PD) results in the
development of abnormal involuntary movements called L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. 
Increasing evidences suggest that the endocannabinoid system may play a role in
the modulation of dyskinesias. In this work, we assessed the antidyskinetic
effect of the endocannabinoid analog oleoylethanolamide (OEA), an agonist of
PPARa and antagonist of TRPV1 receptors. We used a hemiparkinsonian model of PD
in mice with 6-OHDA striatal lesion. The chronic L-DOPA treatment developed
intense axial, forelimb and orolingual dyskinetic symptoms, as well as
contralateral rotations. Treatment with OEA reduced all these symptoms without
reducing motor activity or the therapeutic motor effects of L-DOPA. Moreover, the
OEA-induced reduction in dyskinetic behavior correlated with a reduction in
molecular correlates of dyskinesia. OEA reduced FosB striatal overexpression and 
phosphoacetylation of histone 3, both molecular markers of L-DOPA-induced
dyskinesias. We found that OEA antidyskinetic properties were mediated by TRPV1
receptor, as pretreatment with capsaicin, a TRPV1 agonist, blocked OEA
antidyskinetic actions, as well as the reduction in FosB- and
pAcH3-overexpression induced by L-DOPA. This study supports the hypothesis that
the endocannabinoid system plays an important role in the development and
expression of dyskinesias and might be an effective target for the treatment of
L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. Importantly, there was no development of tolerance to
OEA in any of the parameters we examined, which has important implications for
the therapeutic potential of drugs targeting the endocannabinoid system.

Inorganic arsenic is known to be a human carcinogen. Previous studies have
reported that DNA methylation changes are involved in arsenic-induced
carcinogenesis, therefore, DNA methylation changes that are specific to
arsenic-induced tumors would be useful to distinguish tumors induced by arsenic
from tumors caused by other factors and to dissect arsenic carcinogenesis.
Previous studies have shown that gestational arsenic exposure of C3H mice, which 
tend to spontaneously develop liver tumors, increases the incidence of tumors in 
male offspring. In this study we used the same experimental protocol as in those 
previous studies and searched for DNA regions where methylation status was
specifically altered in the liver tumors of arsenic-exposed offspring by using
methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-CpG island microarrays. The methylation levels
of the DNA regions selected were measured by quantitative methylation-specific
PCR and bisulfite sequencing. The results of this study clarified a number of
regions where DNA methylation status was altered in the liver tumors in the C3H
mice compared to normal liver tissues. Among such regions, we showed that a gene 
body region of the oncogene Fosb underwent alteration in DNA methylation by
gestational arsenic exposure. We also showed that Fosb expression significantly
increased corresponding to the DNA methylation level of the gene body in the
arsenic-exposed group. These findings suggest that the DNA methylation status can
be used to identify tumors increased by gestational arsenic exposure.

Long-term l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) treatment in Parkinson's disease 
(PD) leads to l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID), a condition thought to primarily
involve the dopamine D1 receptor-expressing striatal medium spiny neurons.
Activation of the D1 receptor results in increased expression of several
molecular markers, in particular the members of the immediate-early gene (IEG)
family, a class of genes rapidly transcribed in response to an external stimulus.
However, several dopaminoceptive structures in the brain that are likely to be
affected by the exogenously produced DA have received little attention although
they might play a key role in mediating those l-DOPA-induced abnormal behaviours.
<U+0394>FosB, ARC, FRA2 and Zif268 IEGs expression patterns were thus characterised,
using unbiased stereological methods, in the whole brain of dyskinetic and
non-dyskinetic rats to identify brain nuclei displaying a transcriptional
response specifically related to LID. Within the basal ganglia, the striatum and 
the substantia nigra pars reticulata showed an increased expression of all four
IEGs in dyskinetic compared to non-dyskinetic rats. Outside the basal ganglia,
there was a striking increased expression of the four IEGs in the motor cortex,
the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the dorsal hippocampus, the pontine
nuclei, the cuneiform nucleus and the pedunculopontine nuclei. Moreover, the zona
incerta and the lateral habenula displayed an overexpression of <U+0394>FosB, ARC and
Zif268. Among these structures, the IEG expression in the striatum, the bed
nucleus of the stria terminalis, the lateral habenula, the pontine nuclei and the
cuneiform nucleus correlate with LID severity. These results illustrate a global 
transcriptional response to a dyskinetic state in the whole brain suggesting the 
possible involvement of these structures in LID.

<U+0394>FosB induction correlates inversely with CB1 receptor desensitization in a brain
region-dependent manner following repeated <U+0394><U+2079>-THC administration.

Repeated <U+0394>(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) administration produces desensitization 
and downregulation of cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1Rs) in the brain, but the 
magnitude of these adaptations varies among regions. CB1Rs in the striatum and
its output regions exhibit the least magnitude and slowest development of
desensitization and downregulation. The molecular mechanisms that confer these
region-dependent differences are not known. The stable transcription factor,
<U+0394>FosB, is induced in the striatum following repeated THC administration and could
regulate CB1Rs. To directly compare the regional profile of <U+0394>FosB induction and
CB1R desensitization and downregulation, mice were treated with THC (10 mg/kg) or
vehicle for 13.5 days. CP55,940-stimulated [(35)S]GTP<U+03B3>S autoradiography and
immunohistochemistry were performed to measure CB1R desensitization and
downregulation, respectively, and <U+0394>FosB expression was measured by immunoblot.
Significant CB1R desensitization and downregulation occurred in the prefrontal
cortex, lateral amygdala and hippocampus; desensitization was found in the
basomedial amygdala and no changes were seen in remaining regions. <U+0394>FosB was
induced in the prefrontal cortex, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens and lateral 
amygdala. An inverse regional relationship between <U+0394>FosB expression and CB1R
desensitization was found, such that regions with the greatest <U+0394>FosB induction
did not exhibit CB1R desensitization and areas without <U+0394>FosB induction had the
greatest desensitization, with remaining regions exhibiting intermediate levels
of both. Dual immunohistochemistry in the striatum showed both CB1R
co-localization with <U+0394>FosB in cells and CB1R puncta surrounding <U+0394>FosB-positive
cells. THC-induced expression of <U+0394>FosB was absent in the striatum of CB1R
knockout mice. These data suggest that transcriptional targets of <U+0394>FosB might
inhibit CB1R desensitization and/or that <U+0394>FosB induction could be limited by CB1R
desensitization.

stress-induced anhedonia.

Restraint and immobilization have been extensively used to study habituation of
the neuroendocrine response to a repeated stressor, but behavioral consequences
of this stress regimen remain largely uncharacterized. In this study, we used
sucrose preference and the elevated-plus maze to probe behavioral alterations
resulting from 14 days of restraint in rats. We observed a decrease in sucrose
preference in stressed animals, particularly in a subgroup of individuals, but no
alteration in anxiety behaviors (as measured in the elevated-plus maze) four days
following the last restraint. In these low-sucrose preference animals, we
observed a downregulation of the expression of preproenkephalin mRNA in the
nucleus accumbens. Furthermore, we observed a strong correlation between
enkephalin expression and sucrose preference in the shell part of the nucleus
accumbens, with a lower level of enkephalin expression being associated with
lower sucrose preference. Interestingly, quantification of the corticosterone
response revealed a delayed habituation to restraint in the low-sucrose
preference population, which suggests that vulnerability to stress-induced
deficits might be associated with prolonged exposure to glucocorticoids. The
induction of <U+0394>FosB is also reduced in the nucleus accumbens shell of the
low-sucrose preference population and this transcription factor is expressed in
enkephalin neurons. Taken together, these results suggest that a <U+0394>FosB-mediated
downregulation of enkephalin in the nucleus accumbens might underlie the
susceptibility to chronic stress. Further experiments will be needed to determine
causality between these two phenomena.

<U+0394>FosB, a FosB gene product, is induced in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) by repeated
exposure to several stimuli including antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol.
However, the functional consequences of increased <U+0394>FosB expression following
antipsychotic treatment have not been explored. Here, we assessed whether <U+0394>FosB
induction by haloperidol mediates the positive or negative consequences or
clinical-related actions of antipsychotic treatment. We show that individuals
with schizophrenia who were medicated with antipsychotic drugs at their time of
death display increased <U+0394>FosB levels in the PFC, an effect that is replicated in 
rats treated chronically with haloperidol. In contrast, individuals with
schizophrenia who were medication-free did not exhibit this effect.
Viral-mediated overexpression of <U+0394>FosB in the PFC of rodents induced cognitive
deficits as measured by inhibitory avoidance, increased startle responses in
prepulse inhibition tasks, and increased MK-801-induced anxiety-like behaviors.
Together, these results suggest that <U+0394>FosB induction in the PFC by antipsychotic 
treatment contributes to the deleterious effects of these drugs and not to their 
therapeutic actions.

Knockdown of tyrosine hydroxylase in the nucleus of the solitary tract reduces
elevated blood pressure during chronic intermittent hypoxia.

Noradrenergic A2 neurons in nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) respond to stressors
such as hypoxia. We hypothesize that tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) knockdown in NTS
reduces cardiovascular responses to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), a model
of the arterial hypoxemia observed during sleep apnea in humans. Adult male
Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with radiotelemetry transmitters and
adeno-associated viral constructs with green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter
having either short hairpin RNA (shRNA) for TH or scrambled virus (scRNA) were
injected into caudal NTS. Virus-injected rats were exposed to 7 days of CIH
(alternating periods of 10% O2 and of 21% O2 from 8 AM to 4 PM; from 4 PM to 8 AM
rats were exposed to 21% O2). CIH increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) and
heart rate (HR) during the day in both the scRNA (n = 14, P < 0.001 MAP and HR)
and shRNA (n = 13, P < 0.001 MAP and HR) groups. During the night, MAP and HR
remained elevated in the scRNA rats (P < 0.001 MAP and HR) but not in the shRNA
group. TH immunoreactivity and protein were reduced in the shRNA group.
FosB/<U+0394>FosB immunoreactivity was decreased in paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of
shRNA group (P < 0.001). However, the shRNA group did not show any change in the 
FosB/<U+0394>FosB immunoreactivity in the rostral ventrolateral medulla. Exposure to CIH
increased MAP which persisted beyond the period of exposure to CIH. Knockdown of 
TH in the NTS reduced this CIH-induced persistent increase in MAP and reduced the
transcriptional activation of PVN. This indicates that NTS A2 neurons play a role
in the cardiovascular responses to CIH.

Female adolescent exposure to cannabinoids causes transgenerational effects on
morphine sensitization in female offspring in the absence of in utero exposure.

Female adolescent marijuana use is increasing, yet the effect on future offspring
is unknown. Here, adolescent female Sprague Dawley rats (postnatal-day 30; PN30) 
were given subcutaneous (s.c.) injections with the cannabinoid agonist WIN-55,212
(WIN) or its vehicle (VEH) for three consecutive days using a twice-daily,
increasing dosage regimen (1 mg/kg day 1; 2 mg/kg day 2; 4 mg/kg day 3). As
adults (PN60), females were mated with drug-naïve males. Their adult female
offspring (VEH-F1 or WIN-F1) were tested for behavioral sensitization by
administering morphine (0 or 7.5 mg/kg s.c.) every other day for a total of five 
administrations. Following five days of abstinence, all animals received a
morphine challenge (7.5 mg/kg s.c.) and locomotor activity was monitored. At
completion of behavioral testing, mu opioid receptor (OPRM1), FosB, cFos, and
dopamine receptor mRNA expression was measured in the nucleus accumbens as well
as OPRM1 and corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA in the paraventricular nucleus.
In addition, plasma corticosterone levels were examined. On the day of challenge,
morphine-pretreated WIN-F1 animals demonstrated a significantly enhanced response
to morphine compared to morphine-pretreated VEH-F1 animals. Also following the
morphine challenge, significantly higher levels of OPRM1 in the nucleus accumbens
were observed in WIN-F1 animals. Together, these findings demonstrate
transgenerational effects of adolescent exposure to cannabinoids in the absence
of any in utero exposure.

The extraction of simple relationships in growth factor-specific multiple-input
and multiple-output systems in cell-fate decisions by backward elimination PLS
regression.

Cells use common signaling molecules for the selective control of downstream gene
expression and cell-fate decisions. The relationship between signaling molecules 
and downstream gene expression and cellular phenotypes is a multiple-input and
multiple-output (MIMO) system and is difficult to understand due to its
complexity. For example, it has been reported that, in PC12 cells, different
types of growth factors activate MAP kinases (MAPKs) including ERK, JNK, and p38,
and CREB, for selective protein expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) such
as c-FOS, c-JUN, EGR1, JUNB, and FOSB, leading to cell differentiation,
proliferation and cell death; however, how multiple-inputs such as MAPKs and CREB
regulate multiple-outputs such as expression of the IEGs and cellular phenotypes 
remains unclear. To address this issue, we employed a statistical method called
partial least squares (PLS) regression, which involves a reduction of the
dimensionality of the inputs and outputs into latent variables and a linear
regression between these latent variables. We measured 1,200 data points for
MAPKs and CREB as the inputs and 1,900 data points for IEGs and cellular
phenotypes as the outputs, and we constructed the PLS model from these data. The 
PLS model highlighted the complexity of the MIMO system and growth
factor-specific input-output relationships of cell-fate decisions in PC12 cells. 
Furthermore, to reduce the complexity, we applied a backward elimination method
to the PLS regression, in which 60 input variables were reduced to 5 variables,
including the phosphorylation of ERK at 10 min, CREB at 5 min and 60 min, AKT at 
5 min and JNK at 30 min. The simple PLS model with only 5 input variables
demonstrated a predictive ability comparable to that of the full PLS model. The 5
input variables effectively extracted the growth factor-specific simple
relationships within the MIMO system in cell-fate decisions in PC12 cells.

Central losartan attenuates increases in arterial pressure and expression of
FosB/<U+0394>FosB along the autonomic axis associated with chronic intermittent hypoxia.

Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) increases mean arterial pressure (MAP) and
FosB/<U+0394>FosB staining in central autonomic nuclei. To test the role of the brain
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in CIH hypertension, rats were implanted with
intracerebroventricular (icv) cannulae delivering losartan (1 µg/h) or vehicle
(VEH) via miniosmotic pumps and telemetry devices for arterial pressure
recording. A third group was given the same dose of losartan subcutaneously (sc).
Two groups of losartan-treated rats served as normoxic controls. Rats were
exposed to CIH or normoxia for 7 days and then euthanized for
immunohistochemistry. Intracerebroventricular losartan attenuated CIH-induced
increases in arterial pressure during CIH exposure (0800-1600 during the light
phase) on days 1, 6, and 7 and each day during the normoxic dark phase.
FosB/<U+0394>FosB staining in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT),
median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus
(PVN), the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), and the nucleus of the solitary 
tract (NTS) was decreased in icv losartan-treated rats. Subcutaneous losartan
also reduced CIH hypertension during the last 2 days of CIH and produced
bradycardia prior to the effect on blood pressure. Following sc losartan,
FosB/<U+0394>FosB staining was reduced only in the OVLT, MnPO, PVN, and NTS. These data 
indicate that the central and peripheral RAS contribute to CIH-induced
hypertension and transcriptional activation of autonomic nuclei and that the
contribution of the central RAS is greater during the normoxic dark phase of CIH 
hypertension.

Structural and chemical aspects of resistance to the antibiotic fosfomycin
conferred by FosB from Bacillus cereus.

The fosfomycin resistance enzymes, FosB, from Gram-positive organisms, are
M(2+)-dependent thiol tranferases that catalyze nucleophilic addition of either
L-cysteine (L-Cys) or bacillithiol (BSH) to the antibiotic, resulting in a
modified compound with no bacteriacidal properties. Here we report the structural
and functional characterization of FosB from Bacillus cereus (FosB(Bc)). The
overall structure of FosB(Bc), at 1.27 Å resolution, reveals that the enzyme
belongs to the vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) superfamily. Crystal structures of
FosB(Bc) cocrystallized with fosfomycin and a variety of divalent metals,
including Ni(2+), Mn(2+), Co(2+), and Zn(2+), indicate that the antibiotic
coordinates to the active site metal center in an orientation similar to that
found in the structurally homologous manganese-dependent fosfomycin resistance
enzyme, FosA. Surface analysis of the FosB(Bc) structures show a well-defined
binding pocket and an access channel to C1 of fosfomycin, the carbon to which
nucleophilic addition of the thiol occurs. The pocket and access channel are
appropriate in size and shape to accommodate L-Cys or BSH. Further investigation 
of the structures revealed that the fosfomycin molecule, anchored by the metal,
is surrounded by a cage of amino acids that hold the antibiotic in an orientation
such that C1 is centered at the end of the solvent channel, positioning the
compound for direct nucleophilic attack by the thiol substrate. In addition, the 
structures of FosB(Bc) in complex with the L-Cys-fosfomycin product (1.55 Å
resolution) and in complex with the bacillithiol-fosfomycin product (1.77 Å
resolution) coordinated to a Mn(2+) metal in the active site have been
determined. The L-Cys moiety of either product is located in the solvent channel,
where the thiol has added to the backside of fosfomycin C1 located at the end of 
the channel. Concomitant kinetic analyses of FosB(Bc) indicated that the enzyme
has a preference for BSH over L-Cys when activated by Mn(2+) and is inhibited by 
Zn(2+). The fact that Zn(2+) is an inhibitor of FosB(Bc) was used to obtain a
ternary complex structure of the enzyme with both fosfomycin and L-Cys bound.

Neutrophils (PMN) play diverse regulatory and effector functions in the immune
system through the release of reactive nitrogen species, including nitric oxide
(NO). The enzyme responsible for NO synthesis in PMN is inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS) that is regulated by various signaling pathways, e.g.
PI3K-Akt/PKB, and transcription factors. N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a
xenobiotic widespread in the human environment, affects immune cells. The study
objective here was to examine the role of the PI3K-Akt/PKB pathway in induction
of NO synthesis (with involvement of iNOS) in human PMN, as well as in autologous
mononuclear cells (PBMC), exposed to NDMA. Isolated cells were incubated for 2<U+2009>h 
with a sub-lethal dose of NDMA and then the expression of several select proteins
in the cell cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were determined by Western blot
analyses. The results indicated that NDMA enhanced expression of iNOS,
phospho-PI3K, and phospho-I<U+03BA>Ba in the cytoplasmic fraction of the PMN and PBMC.
The nuclear fraction of these cells also had a higher NF-<U+03BA>B expression. Moreover,
in PMN, NDMA caused an increased expression of phospho-Akt (T308), phospho-Akt
(S473), and phospho-IKKaß in the cytoplasm, and c-Jun and FosB in the nuclear
fraction. Blocking of PI3K caused a decrease in expression of all these proteins 
in NDMA-exposed PMN. However, inhibition of PI3K led to a drop in expression of
iNOS, phospho-PI3K, and phospho-I<U+03BA>Ba in the cytoplasm, and in NF-<U+03BA>B in the
nuclear fraction, of PBMC. The results of these studies indicated to us that NDMA
activates the PI3K-Akt/PKB pathway in human PMN and that this, in turn,
contributes to the activation of transcription factors NF-<U+03BA>B, c-Jun, and FosB
involved in NO production (through modulation of iNOS expression).

Genes and proteins of the Fos family are used as markers of neuronal activity and
can be modulated by stress. This study investigated whether social defeat (SD) or
exposure to an olfactory cue associated with the SD experience activated Fos and 
FosB/DeltaFosB (<U+0394>FosB) expression in brain regions implicated in the development 
of post-traumatic stress disorder. Mice exposed to acute SD showed more Fos
positive cells in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), CA1 of the hippocampus and the 
medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) 1h after SD, and had greater expression of the
more persistent FosB/<U+0394>FosB protein in the BLA 24 h after SD compared to controls.
Mice exposed to an olfactory cue 24 h or 7 days after SD had higher levels of Fos
expression in all three regions 1h after exposure to the cue, and displayed
increased avoidance behavior compared to controls. While the avoidance response
dissipated with time (less at 7 day vs 24 h after social defeat), Fos expression 
in the mPFC and CA1 in response to an olfactory cue was greater at 7 days
relative to 24 h after social defeat. The results suggest additional processing
of the cue-stress association and may provide further support for a role of the
mPFC in fear inhibition. These findings may have implications for brain regions
and circuitry involved in the avoidance of cues associated with a stressful event
that may lead to context-dependent adaptive or maladaptive behavior.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study reported here was to investigate the molecular
responses of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to loading with a model that
attempts to closely mimic the physiological mechanical loading of bone, using
monetite calcium phosphate (CaP) scaffolds to mimic the biomechanical properties 
of bone and a bioreactor to induce appropriate load and strain.
METHODS: Human MSCs were seeded onto CaP scaffolds and subjected to a pulsating
compressive force of 5.5±4.5 N at a frequency of 0.1 Hz. Early molecular
responses to mechanical loading were assessed by microarray and quantitative
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and activation of signal
transduction cascades was evaluated by western blotting analysis.
RESULTS: The maximum mechanical strain on cell/scaffolds was calculated at around
0.4%. After 2 h of loading, a total of 100 genes were differentially expressed.
The largest cluster of genes activated with 2 h stimulation was the regulator of 
transcription, and it included FOSB. There were also changes in genes involved in
cell cycle and regulation of protein kinase cascades. When cells were rested for 
6 h after mechanical stimulation, gene expression returned to normal. Further
resting for a total of 22 h induced upregulation of 63 totally distinct genes
that were mainly involved in cell surface receptor signal transduction and
regulation of metabolic and cell division processes. In addition, the osteogenic 
transcription factor RUNX-2 was upregulated. Twenty-four hours of persistent
loading also markedly induced osterix expression. Mechanical loading resulted in 
upregulation of Erk1/2 phosphorylation and the gene expression study identified a
number of possible genes (SPRY2, RIPK1, SPRED2, SERTAD1, TRIB1, and RAPGEF2) that
may regulate this process.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that mechanical loading activates a small number 
of immediate-early response genes that are mainly associated with transcriptional
regulation, which subsequently results in activation of a wider group of genes
including those associated with osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. The
results provide a valuable insight into molecular events and signal transduction 
pathways involved in the regulation of MSC osteogenic differentiation in response
to a physiological level of mechanical stimulation.

Avoidance susceptibility may constitute a vulnerability to develop anxiety
disorders, and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats exhibit unique features in their
acquisition of avoidance behavior that appear to promote susceptibility to this
form of learning, namely the absence of the commonly observed "warm-up" effect.
The present study sought to determine if strain differences in acquired avoidance
behavior, between WKY and Sprague Dawley rats, could be attributed to differences
in dopamine-related plasticity, represented by extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) activity, and prolonged neuronal activation, represented by <U+0394>FosB
accumulation, in three key areas of the brain: the medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC), dorsal striatum (DS), and basolateral amygdala (BLA). Consistent with
earlier work, WKY rats exhibited a higher level of asymptotic performance of
avoidance behavior, which included an absence of warm-up in the first few trials 
of later training sessions, and they exhibited more non-reinforced anticipatory
responses in the single minute prior to the initiation of the first warning
signal presentation of each training session. In the brain, phosyphorylated ERK2 
(pERK2) activation was higher in avoidance trained rats in both the mPFC and DS, 
although the difference in DS was mostly observed in WKY rats. Avoidance-training
was associated with higher levels of <U+0394>FosB expression in the mPFC of SD rats, but
not WKY rats. The strain differences in pERK2 activation in the DS and <U+0394>FosB
levels in the mPFC may underlie the strain-specific differences observed in
warm-up, the emission of non-reinforced anticipatory responses, and general
differences in asymptotic performance of active avoidance behavior. The mPFC and 
DS require further study as potential neural targets for understanding avoidance 
susceptibility and, as a result, anxiety vulnerability.

Epilepsy is a heterogeneous and chronic neurological condition of undefined
etiology in the majority of cases. Similarly, the pathogenesis of the unprovoked 
seizures that lead to epilepsy is not known. We are interested in the factors
that modify inherent seizure susceptibility, with a particular focus on those
occurring during the prenatal and early postnatal periods. Female Sprague-Dawley 
rats were bred in-house or transported during pregnancy at one of two gestational
days (G9 or G16). The effects of transport stress, maternal behavior, and
offspring sex were then examined in terms of how they were related to provoked
seizure susceptibility to kainic acid (KA) or a model of febrile convulsions
(FCs) on postnatal day 14 (P14). We also examined the pattern of neuronal
activation in the hippocampus and amygdala as indicated by the density of FosB
protein immunoreactivity (FosB-ir). Results demonstrated only a small and
inconsistent effect of transport alone, suggesting that the groups differed
slightly prior to experimental manipulations. However, the influence of maternal 
behaviors such as licking and grooming (LG), arched back nursing (ABN), and
dam-off time (DO) exerted a much stronger effect on the offspring. Dams
designated as high LG gave birth to smaller litters, had pups that weighed less, 
had greater seizure susceptibility and severity, and had more FosB-ir neurons
predominantly in the ventral hippocampus and the medial subnucleus of the
amygdala (MeA). We also found a sex-dependent effect such that P14 males were
smaller than their female littermates and had a greater seizure susceptibility
and severity. Taken together, these results suggest an impact of prenatal and
postnatal factors, as well as sex, on seizure susceptibility in young animals.

Nucleotide receptor P2RX7 stimulation enhances LPS-induced interferon-ß
production in murine macrophages.

Stimulation of P2RX(7) with extracellular ATP potentiates numerous LPS-induced
proinflammatory events, including cytokine induction in macrophages, but the
molecular mechanisms underlying this process are not well defined. Although
P2RX(7) ligation has been proposed to activate several transcription factors,
many of the LPS-induced mediators affected by P2RX(7) activation are not induced 
by P2RX(7) agonists alone, suggesting a complementary role for P2RX(7) in
transcriptional regulation. Type I IFN production, whose expression is tightly
controlled by multiple transcription factors that form an enhanceosome, is
critical for resistance against LPS-containing bacteria. The effect of purinergic
receptor signaling on LPS-dependent type I IFN is unknown and would be of great
relevance to a diverse array of inflammatory conditions. The present study
demonstrates that stimulation of macrophages with P2RX(7) agonists substantially 
enhances LPS-induced IFN-ß expression, and this enhancement is ablated in
macrophages that do not express functional P2RX(7) or when the MAPK MEK1/2
pathways are inhibited. Potentiation of LPS-induced IFN-ß expression following
P2RX(7) stimulation is likely transcriptionally regulated, as this enhancement is
observed at the IFN-ß promoter level. Furthermore, P2RX(7) stimulation is able to
increase the phosphorylation and subsequent IFN-ß promoter occupancy of IRF-3, a 
transcription factor that is critical for IFN-ß transcription by TLR agonists.
This newly discovered role for P2RX(7) in IFN regulation may have implications in
antimicrobial defense, which has been linked to P2RX(7) activation in other
studies.

A total of 34 Staphylococcus aureus isolates from flock-wise pooled chicken neck 
skin samples collected at two abattoirs during slaughter were characterized with 
DNA microarray analysis and spa typing. The 20 isolates from abattoir A all
belonged to clonal complex (CC) 12 and spa type t160. Of the 14 isolates from
abattoir B, 7 belonged to CC5-t3478, 5 to CC12-t160, 1 to CC45-t040, and 1 to
CC101-t056. Of the various resistance-associated genes tested, only blaZ/R/I (6
isolates of CC12 and CC101 from abattoir B), sdrM (n = 34), fosB (n = 33), and
qacC (n = 22) were detected. None of the isolates harbored genes conferring
methicillin resistance. In terms of genes encoding enterotoxins, seb (all
isolates of CC12), egc (seg, sei, selm, seln, selo, selu; all isolates of CC5 and
CC45), and sea (14 isolates of CC12 and 1 isolate of CC5) were found. In
addition, all isolates harbored genes for intracellular adhesion proteins
(icaA/C/D) and were positive for cap5 or cap8 (capsule type 5 or 8). Comparison
of DNA microarray profiles identified four categories comprising (i) all isolates
of CC12, (ii) all isolates of CC5, (iii) the CC45 isolate, and (iv) the CC101
isolate. The high similarity of the isolates from abattoir A could indicate
contamination of chicken carcasses with S. aureus persisting on the slaughter
equipment, but further investigations are required to elucidate potential
contamination routes.

The hypocretin/orexin receptor-1 as a novel target to modulate cannabinoid
reward.

BACKGROUND: Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug in the world. Although 
there is a high prevalence of users who seek treatment for cannabis dependence,
no accepted pharmacologic treatment is available to facilitate and maintain
abstinence. The hypocretin/orexin system plays a critical role in drug addiction,
but the potential participation of this system in the addictive properties of
cannabinoids is unknown.
METHODS: We investigated the effects of hypocretins in the intravenous
self-administration of the synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN55,212-2 using
hypocretin receptor-1 (Hcrtr-1) and hypocretin receptor-2 antagonists and Hcrtr-1
knockout mice. Additional groups of mice were trained to obtain water to rule out
operant responding impairments. Activation of hypocretin neurons was analyzed by 
using double-label immunofluorescence of FosB/<U+0394>FosB with hypocretin-1.
Microdialysis studies were performed to evaluate dopamine extracellular levels in
the nucleus accumbens after acute <U+0394>(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol administration.
RESULTS: Systemic administration of the Hcrtr-1 antagonist SB334867 reduced
intravenous self-administration of WIN55,212-2, as well as the maximum effort to 
obtain a WIN55,212-2 infusion, as revealed under a progressive ratio schedule.
This role of Hcrtr-1 in the reinforcing and motivational properties of
WIN55,212-2 was confirmed in Hcrtr-1 knockout mice. Contingent, but not
noncontingent, WIN55,212-2 self-administration increased the percentage of
hypocretin cells expressing FosB/<U+0394>FosB in the lateral hypothalamus. The
enhancement in dopamine extracellular levels in the nucleus accumbens induced by 
<U+0394>(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol was blocked in mice lacking the Hcrtr-1.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that Hcrtr-1 modulates the reinforcing
properties of cannabinoids, which could have a clear therapeutic interest.

Detection of molecular alterations in methamphetamine-activated Fos-expressing
neurons from a single rat dorsal striatum using fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS).

Methamphetamine and other drugs activate a small proportion of all neurons in the
brain. We previously developed a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based
method to characterize molecular alterations induced selectively in activated
neurons that express the neural activity marker Fos. However, this method
requires pooling samples from many rats. We now describe a modified FACS-based
method to characterize molecular alterations in Fos-expressing dorsal striatal
neurons from a single rat using a multiplex pre-amplification strategy. Fos and
NeuN (a neuronal marker) immunohistochemistry indicate that 5-6% of dorsal
striatum neurons were activated 90 min after acute methamphetamine injections (5 
mg/kg, i.p.) while less than 0.5% of neurons were activated by saline injections.
We used FACS to separate NeuN-labeled neurons into Fos-positive and Fos-negative 
neurons and assessed mRNA expression using RT-qPCR from as little as five
Fos-positive neurons. Methamphetamine induced 3-20-fold increases of immediate
early genes arc, homer-2, c-fos, fosB, and its isoforms (<U+0394>fosB and a novel
isoform <U+0394>fosB-2) in Fos-positive but not Fos-negative neurons. Immediate early
gene mRNA induction was 10-fold lower or absent when assessed in unsorted samples
from single dorsal striatum homogenates. Our modified method makes it feasible to
study unique molecular alterations in neurons activated by drugs or
drug-associated cues in complex addiction models. Methamphetamine and other drugs
activate a small proportion of all neurons in the brain. We here report an
improved method to characterize molecular alterations induced selectively in
activated neurons that express the neural activity marker Fos. We used FACS along
with targeted PCR pre-amplification to assess acute methamphetamine-induced gene 
expression from as few as 5 Fos-expressing neurons from a single rat dorsal
striatum. Methamphetamine induced 3-20-fold increases of immediate early genes
(IEGs) in Fos-positive but not Fos-negative neurons. Targeted PCR
pre-amplification makes it feasible to study unique molecular alterations in
neurons activated by drugs or drug-associated cues in complex addiction models.

Etifoxine stimulates allopregnanolone synthesis in the spinal cord to produce
analgesia in experimental mononeuropathy.

Intégratives, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and University of
Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.

BACKGROUND: Pathological pain states are often associated with neuronal
hyperexcitability in the spinal cord. Reducing this excitability could
theoretically be achieved by amplifying the existing spinal inhibitory control
mediated by GABAA receptors (GABAARs). In this study, we used the
non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic etifoxine (EFX) to characterize its interest as
pain killer and spinal mechanisms of action. EFX potentiates GABAAR function but 
can also increase its function by stimulating the local synthesis of 3a-reduced
neurosteroids (3aNS), the most potent endogenous modulators of this receptor.
METHODS: The efficacy of EFX analgesia and the contribution of 3aNS were
evaluated in a rat model of mononeuropathy. Spinal contribution of EFX was
characterized through changes in pain symptoms after intrathecal injections,
spinal content of EFX and 3aNS, and expression of FosB-related genes, a marker of
long-term plasticity.
RESULTS: We found that a 2-week treatment with EFX (>5<U+2009>mg/kg, i.p.) fully
suppressed neuropathic pain symptoms. This effect was fully mediated by 3aNS and 
probably by allopregnanolone, which was found at a high concentration in the
spinal cord. In good agreement, the level of EFX analgesia after intrathecal
injections confirmed that the spinal cord is a privileged target as well as the
limited expression of FosB/<U+0394>FosB gene products that are highly expressed in
persistent pain states.
CONCLUSIONS: This preclinical study shows that stimulating the production of
endogenous analgesics such as 3aNS represents an interesting strategy to reduce
neuropathic pain symptoms. Since EFX is already prescribed as an anxiolytic in
several countries, a translation to the human clinic needs to be rapidly
evaluated.

Alcohol addiction is a major social and health concern. Here, we determined the
expression profile of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rats
treated with alcohol. The results suggest that multiple miRNAs were aberrantly
expressed in rat NAc after alcohol injection. Among them, miR-382 was
down-regulated in alcohol-treated rats. In both cultured neuronal cells in vitro 
and in the NAc in vivo, we identified that the dopamine receptor D1 (Drd1) is a
direct target gene of miR-382. Via this target gene, miR-382 strongly modulated
the expression of DeltaFosB. Moreover, overexpression of miR-382 significantly
attenuated alcohol-induced up-regulation of DRD1 and DeltaFosB, decreased
voluntary intake of and preference for alcohol and inhibited the DRD1-induced
action potential responses. The results indicated that miRNAs are involved in and
may represent novel therapeutic targets for alcoholism.

OBJECTIVE: Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins inhibit chemokine
signaling by desensitizing G protein-coupled receptor signals. This study was
undertaken to determine the mechanisms by which RGS13 promotes the generation of 
pathogenic autoantibodies in germinal centers (GCs), using BXD2-Rgs13-/- mice.
METHODS: Confocal and light microscopy imaging techniques were used to determine 
the location of cells that express RGS13 and activation-induced cytidine
deaminase (AID) in the mouse spleen, and the number of plasmablasts. The levels
of GC and plasma cell program transcripts in GC B cells were determined by
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Differential
interleukin-17 (IL-17)-mediated expression of RGS13 in GC versus non-GC B cells
was analyzed using A20 and 70Z/3 B cells.
RESULTS: In the spleens of BXD2 mice, RGS13 was mainly expressed by GC B cells
and was stimulated by IL-17 but not IL-21. IL-17 up-regulated RGS13 in A20 GC
cells but not 70Z/3 non-GC B cells. BXD2- Rgs13-/- mice exhibited smaller GCs and
lower AID levels, suggesting lower somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation.
However, GC B cells from BXD2- Rgs13-/- mice showed increased levels of IgMbright
plasmablasts, up-regulation of the genes encoding plasma program, including
interferon regulatory factor 4, B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1, and
X-box binding protein 1 and the p-CREB target genes Fosb and Obf1, and
down-regulation of the GC program genes Aid, Pax5, and Bach2 compared to BXD2
mice. BXD2-Rgs13-/- mice had lower titers of IgG autoantibodies and IgG deposits 
in the glomeruli, suggesting reduced autoantibody pathogenicity.
CONCLUSION: RGS13 deficiency is associated with a reduction in GC program genes
and the exit of fewer pathogenic IgM plasmablasts in BXD2 mice. Our findings
indicate that prolonged GC program, mediated by up-regulation of RGS13, enhances 
AID expression and enables the generation of pathogenic autoantibodies in
autoreactive GCs.

Recently, a group of microRNAs (miRNAs) were shown to be dysregulated in gliomas,
and involved in glioma development. However, the effect of miRNA-miRNA functional
networks on gliomas is poorly understood. In this study, we identified that FBJ
murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FOS)-mediated miR-181b/miR-21
signalling was critical for glioma progression. Using microarrays and
quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), we found increased FOS in high grade gliomas. FOS 
depletion (via FOS-shRNA), inhibited invasion and promoted apoptosis in glioma
cells. Using microarrays, combined with Pearson correlation analysis, we found
FOS positively correlated with miR-21 expression. Reduction of FOS inhibited
miR-21 expression by binding to the miR-21 promoter using luciferase reporter
assays. Introduction of miR-21 abrogated FOS knockdown-induced cell invasion and 
apoptosis. Moreover, bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays showed that
miR-181b modulated FOS expression by directly targeting the binding site within
the 3'UTR. Expression of FOS with a FOS cDNA lacking 3'UTR overrided
miR-181b-induced miR-21 expression and cell function. Finally,
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridisation (ISH) analysis revealed a
significant correlation in miR-181b, FOS and miR-21 expression in nude mouse
tumour xenograft and human glioma tissues. To our knowledge, it is the first time
to demonstrate that miR-181b/FOS/miR-21 signalling plays a critical role in the
progression of gliomas, providing important clues for understanding the key roles
of transcription factor mediated miRNA-miRNA functional network in the regulation
of gliomas.

hepatectomy in rats.

Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Possible spleno-hepatic relationships affected by hepatectomy
still remained unclear. We have previously reported that splenectomy may
ameliorate liver injuries and promote appropriate liver regeneration after
massive hepatectomy. Therefore, we investigated the effects of splenectomy on the
DNA expression profile in the liver after massive hepatectomy in rats.
METHODS: Rats were divided into the following two groups: 90% hepatectomy (Hx
group) and 90% hepatectomy with splenectomy (Hx<U+2009>+<U+2009>Sp group). Rats were sacrificed
3 and 6<U+2009>h after surgery, and mRNA from liver tissue was isolated and hybridized
to Affymetrix GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA,
USA) and a pathway analysis was done with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity
Systems, Mountain View, CA, USA).
RESULTS: We determined the Hx<U+2009>+<U+2009>Sp/Hx ratio to assess the influence of
splenectomy, and cut-off values were set at more than 2.0-fold or less than 1/2
(0.5)-fold. Immediate early response gene including early growth response-1 and
FBJ murine osteosarcoma-related pathways were markedly downregulated by
splenectomy. In contrast, heme oxygenase-1 gene-related pathway was upregulated
by splenectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: Splenectomy provided the protective effects for liver failure and
promoted liver regeneration, possibly owing to the downregulation of immediate
early response genes and upregulation of the heat shock protein, heme
oxygenase-1.

Motivated behaviors, including sexual experience, activate the mesolimbic
dopamine system and produce long-lasting molecular and structural changes in the 
nucleus accumbens. The transcription factor <U+0394>FosB is hypothesized to partly
mediate this experience-dependent plasticity. Previous research in our laboratory
has demonstrated that overexpressing <U+0394>FosB in the nucleus accumbens of female
Syrian hamsters augments the ability of sexual experience to cause the formation 
of a conditioned place preference. It is unknown, however, whether <U+0394>FosB-mediated
transcription in the nucleus accumbens is required for the behavioral
consequences of sexual reward. We therefore used an adeno-associated virus to
overexpress <U+0394>JunD, a dominant negative binding partner of <U+0394>FosB that decreases
<U+0394>FosB-mediated transcription by competitively heterodimerizing with <U+0394>FosB before 
binding at promotor regions on target genes, in the nucleus accumbens. We found
that overexpression of <U+0394>JunD prevented the formation of a conditioned place
preference following repeated sexual experiences. These data, when coupled with
our previous findings, suggest that <U+0394>FosB is both necessary and sufficient for
behavioral plasticity following sexual experience. Furthermore, these results
contribute to an important and growing body of literature demonstrating the
necessity of endogenous <U+0394>FosB expression in the nucleus accumbens for adaptive
responding to naturally rewarding stimuli.

BACKGROUND: L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia is an
incapacitating complication of L-DOPA therapy that affects most patients with
Parkinson's disease. Previous work indicating that molecular sensitization to
dopamine receptor D1 (D1R) stimulation is involved in dyskinesias prompted us to 
perform electrophysiological recordings of striatal projection "medium spiny
neurons" (MSN). Moreover, because enhanced D1R signaling in drug abuse induces
changes in spine density in striatum, we investigated whether the dyskinesia is
related to morphological changes in MSNs.
METHODS: Wild-type and bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice
(D1R-tomato and D2R-green fluorescent protein) mice were lesioned with
6-hydroxydopamine and subsequently treated with L-DOPA to induce dyskinesia.
Functional, molecular, and structural changes were assessed in corticostriatal
slices. Individual MSNs injected with Lucifer-Yellow were detected by
immunohistochemistry for three-dimensional reconstructions with Neurolucida
software. Intracellular current-clamp recordings with high-resistance
micropipettes were used to characterize electrophysiological parameters.
RESULTS: Both D1R-MSNs and D2R-MSNs showed diminished spine density in totally
denervated striatal regions in parkinsonian mice. Chronic L-DOPA treatment, which
induced dyskinesia and aberrant FosB expression, restored spine density in
D2R-MSNs but not in D1R-MSNs. In basal conditions, MSNs are more excitable in
parkinsonian than in sham mice, and excitability decreases toward normal values
after L-DOPA treatment. Despite this normalization of basal excitability, in
dyskinetic mice, the selective D1R agonist SKF38393 increased the number of
evoked action potentials in MSNs, compared with sham animals.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic L-DOPA induces abnormal spine re-growth exclusively in
D2R-MSNs and robust supersensitization to D1R-activated excitability in
denervated striatal MSNs. These changes might constitute the anatomical and
electrophysiological substrates of dyskinesia.

AP1 (jun/fos) transcription factors (c-jun, junB, junD, c-fos, FosB, Fra-1, and
Fra-2) are key regulators of epidermal keratinocyte survival and differentiation 
and important drivers of cancer development. Understanding the role of these
factors in epidermis is complicated by the fact that each protein is expressed,
at different levels, in multiple cells layers in differentiating epidermis, and
because AP1 transcription factors regulate competing processes (i.e.,
proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation). Various in vivo genetic
approaches have been used to study these proteins including targeted and
conditional knockdown, overexpression, and expression of dominant-negative
inactivating AP1 transcription factors in epidermis. Taken together, these
studies suggest that individual AP1 transcription factors have different
functions in the epidermis and in cancer development and that altering AP1
transcription factor function in the basal versus suprabasal layers
differentially influences the epidermal differentiation response and disease and 
cancer development.

Soy extracts have been claimed to be neuroprotective against brain insults, an
effect related to the estrogenic properties of isoflavones. However, the effects 
of individual isoflavones on obesity-induced disruption of adult neurogenesis
have not yet been analyzed. In the present study we explore the effects of
pharmacological administration of daidzein, a main soy isoflavone, in cell
proliferation, cell apoptosis and gliosis in the adult hippocampus of animals
exposed to a very high-fat diet. Rats made obese after 12-week exposure to a
standard or high-fat (HFD, 60%) diets were treated with daidzein (50 mg kg(-1))
for 13 days. Then, plasma levels of metabolites and metabolic hormones, cell
proliferation in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (SGZ), and
immunohistochemical markers of hippocampal cell apoptosis (caspase-3), gliosis
(GFAP and Iba-1), food reward factor FosB and estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) were 
analyzed. Treatment with daidzein reduced food/caloric intake and body weight
gain in obese rats. This was associated with glucose tolerance, low levels of
HDL-cholesterol, insulin, adiponectin and testosterone, and high levels of leptin
and 17ß-estradiol. Daidzein increased the number of phospho-histone H3 and
5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-ir cells detected in the SGZ of standard diet and
HFD-fed rats. Daidzein reversed the HFD-associated enhanced immunohistochemical
expression of caspase-3, FosB, GFAP, Iba-1 and ERa in the hippocampus, being more
prominent in the dentate gyrus. These results suggest that pharmacological
treatment with isoflavones regulates metabolic alterations associated with
enhancement of cell proliferation and reduction of apoptosis and gliosis in
response to high-fat diet.

Neuroplastic changes in the dorsal striatum participate in the transition from
casual to habitual drug use and might play a critical role in the development of 
methamphetamine (METH) addiction. We examined the influence of METH
self-administration on gene and protein expression that may form substrates for
METH-induced neuronal plasticity in the dorsal striatum. Male Sprague-Dawley rats
self-administered METH (0.1mg/kg/injection, i.v.) or received yoked saline
infusions during eight 15-h sessions and were euthanized 2h, 24h, or 1month after
cessation of METH exposure. Changes in gene and protein expression were assessed 
using microarray analysis, RT-PCR and Western blots. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by PCR was used to examine epigenetic
regulation of METH-induced transcription. METH self-administration caused
increases in mRNA expression of the transcription factors, c-fos and fosb, the
neurotrophic factor, Bdnf, and the synaptic protein, synaptophysin (Syp) in the
dorsal striatum. METH also caused changes in <U+0394>FosB, BDNF and TrkB protein levels,
with increases after 2 and 24h, but decreases after 1month of drug abstinence.
Importantly, ChIP-PCR showed that METH self-administration caused enrichment of
phosphorylated CREB (pCREB), but not of histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4
(H3K4me3), on promoters of c-fos, fosb, Bdnf and Syp at 2h after cessation of
drug intake. These findings show that METH-induced changes in gene expression are
mediated, in part, by pCREB-dependent epigenetic phenomena. Thus, METH
self-administration might trigger epigenetic changes that mediate alterations in 
expression of genes and proteins serving as substrates for addiction-related
synaptic plasticity.

The C-terminus of human nucleotide receptor P2X7 is critical for receptor
oligomerization and N-linked glycosylation.

BACKGROUND: The P2X7 receptor binds extracellular ATP to mediate numerous
inflammatory responses and is considered a potential biomarker and therapeutic
target for diverse inflammatory and neurological diseases. P2X7 contains many
single nucleotide polymorphisms, including several mutations located within its
intracellular C-terminal trafficking domain. Mutations within the trafficking
domain result in attenuated receptor activity and cell surface presentation, but 
the mechanisms by which amino acid changes within this region promote altered
P2X7 function have not been elucidated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed the amino acid sequence of P2X7 for any
potential trafficking signals and found that P2X7 contains putative Arg-X-Arg ER 
retention sequences. Alanine substitutions near or within these sequences were
constructed, and we determined that single mutation of R574 and R578 but not R576
or K579 attenuates P2X7-stimulated activation of ERK1/2 and induction of the
transcription factors FosB and <U+0394>FosB. We found that mutation of R578 within the
trafficking domain to the naturally occurring Gln substitution disrupts P2X7
localization at the plasma membrane and results in R578Q displaying a higher
apparent molecular weight in comparison to wild-type receptor. We used the
glycosidase endoglycosidase H to determine that this difference in mass is due in
part to the R578Q mutant possessing a larger mass of oligosaccharides, indicative
of improper N-linked glycosylation addition and/or trimming. Chemical
cross-linking experiments were also performed and suggest that the R578Q variant 
also does not form trimers as well as wild-type receptor, a function required for
its full activity.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the distal C-terminus of P2X7 is important
for oligomerization and post-translational modification of the receptor,
providing a mechanism by which mutations in the trafficking domain disrupt P2X7
activity and localization at the plasma membrane.

BDNF overexpression in the ventral tegmental area prolongs social defeat
stress-induced cross-sensitization to amphetamine and increases <U+0394>FosB expression 
in mesocorticolimbic regions of rats.

Social defeat stress induces persistent cross-sensitization to psychostimulants, 
but the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of cross-sensitization
remain unclear. One candidate is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The
present research examined whether ventral tegmental area (VTA) BDNF
overexpression would prolong the time course of cross-sensitization after a
single social defeat stress, which normally produces transient
cross-sensitization lasting <1 week. <U+0394>FosB, a classic molecular marker of
addiction, was also measured in mesocorticolimbic terminal regions. Separate
groups of intact male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a single episode of social
defeat stress or control handling, followed by amphetamine (AMPH) challenge 3 or 
14 days later. AMPH cross-sensitization was apparent 3, but not 14, days after
stress. Intra-VTA infusion of adeno-associated viral (AAV-BDNF) vector resulted
in a twofold increase of BDNF level in comparison to the group receiving the
control virus (AAV-GFP), which lasted at least 45 days. Additionally,
overexpression of BDNF in the VTA alone increased <U+0394>FosB in the nucleus accumbens 
(NAc) and prefrontal cortex. Fourteen days after viral infusions, a separate
group of rats underwent a single social defeat stress or control handling and
were challenged with AMPH 14 and 24 days after stress. AAV-BDNF rats exposed to
stress showed prolonged cross-sensitization and facilitated sensitization to the 
second drug challenge. Immunohistochemistry showed that the combination of
virally enhanced VTA BDNF, stress, and AMPH resulted in increased <U+0394>FosB in the
NAc shell compared with the other groups. Thus, elevation of VTA BDNF prolongs
cross-sensitization, facilitates sensitization, and increases <U+0394>FosB in
mesocorticolimbic terminal regions. As such, elevated VTA BDNF may be a risk
factor for drug sensitivity.

Sex differences in cocaine's mechanisms of action and behavioral effects have
been widely reported. However, little is known about how sex influences
intracellular signaling cascades involved with drug-environment associations. We 
investigated whether ERK/CREB intracellular responses in the mesocorticolimbic
circuitry underlying cocaine environmental associations are sexually dimorphic.
We used a standard 4 day conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm using
20mg/kg cocaine-a dose that induced CPP in male and female Fischer rats. In the
nucleus accumbens (NAc) following CPP expression, cocaine treated animals showed 
increased phosphorylated ERK (pERK), phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) and <U+0394>FosB
protein levels. In the hippocampus (HIP) and caudate putamen (CPu), pERK and
FosB/<U+0394>FosB levels were also increased, respectively. Cocaine females had a larger
change in HIP pERK and CPu <U+0394>FosB levels than cocaine males; partly due to lower
protein levels in saline female rats when compared to saline males. Prefrontal
cortex (PfC) pCREB levels increased in cocaine males, but not females, whereas
PfC pERK levels were increased in cocaine females, but not males. CPP scores were
positively correlated to NAc pERK, HIP pERK and CPu FosB protein levels,
suggesting that similar to males, the ERK/CREB intracellular pathway in
mesocorticolimbic regions undergoes cocaine induced neuroplasticity in female
rats. However, there seem to be intrinsic (basal) sexual dimorphisms in this
pathway that may contribute to responses expressed after cocaine-CPP. Taken
together, our results suggest that cellular responses associated with the
expression of learned drug-environment associations may play an important role in
sex differences in cocaine addiction and relapse.

in the subiculum of Fmr1 knockout mice.

Young, but not adult, fragile X mental retardation gene (Fmr1) knockout (KO) mice
display audiogenic seizures (AGS) that can be prevented by inhibiting
extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation. In order to 
identify the cerebral regions involved in these phenomena, we characterized the
response to AGS in Fmr1 KO mice and wild type (WT) controls at postnatal day (P) 
45 and P90. To characterize the diverse response to AGS in various cerebral
regions, we evaluated the activity markers FosB/<U+0394>FosB and phosphorylated ERK1/2
(p-ERK1/2). Wild running (100% of tested mice) followed by clonic/tonic seizures 
(30%) were observed in P45 Fmr1 KO mice, but not in WT mice. In P90 Fmr1 KO mice,
wild running was only present in 25% of tested animals. Basal FosB/<U+0394>FosB
immunoreactivity was higher (P < 0.01 vs. WT) in the CA1 and subiculum of P45
Fmr1 KO mice. Following the AGS test, FosB/<U+0394>FosB expression consistently
increased in most of the analyzed regions in both groups at P45, but not at P90. 
Interestingly, FosB/<U+0394>FosB immunoreactivity was significantly higher in P45 Fmr1
KO mice in the medial geniculate body (P < 0.05 vs. WT) and CA3 (P < 0.01).
Neurons presenting with immunopositivity to p-ERK1/2 were more abundant in the
subiculum of Fmr1 KO mice in control condition (P < 0.05 vs. WT, in both age
groups). In this region, p-ERK1/2-immunopositive cells significantly decreased
(-75%, P < 0.01) in P90 Fmr1 KO mice exposed to the AGS test, but no changes were
found in P45 mice or in other brain regions. In both age groups of WT mice,
p-ERK1/2-immunopositive cells increased in the subiculum after exposure to the
acoustic test. Our findings illustrate that FosB/<U+0394>FosB markers are overexpressed 
in the medial geniculate body and CA3 in Fmr1 KO mice experiencing AGS, and that 
p-ERK1/2 is markedly decreased in the subiculum of Fmr1 KO mice resistant to AGS 
induction. These findings suggest that resilience to AGS is associated with
dephosphorylation of p-ERK1/2 in the subiculum of mature Fmr1 KO mice.

The activated transcription factor ERa plays an important role in the breast
development and progression of cancer. In a non-classical pathway ER interacts
with other transcription factors AP-1, NFkB, SP1, etc. AP-1 transcription factors
control rapid responses of mammalian cells to stimuli that impact proliferation, 
differentiation, and transformation. AP-1 factors are leucine zipper proteins
belonging to members of the Jun family (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) and Fos family
(c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2) proteins. Although AP-1 factors are well
characterized, not much is known about the expression pattern of the AP-1 factors
in breast cancer cells. Hence to determine which AP-1 factors are expressed and
regulated by estrogen, we used human breast cancer MCF-7 cells as in vitro model 
system. The MCF-7 cells were treated with or without estradiol-17ß (E2) or
antiestrogen tamoxifen (TMX) and the cell proliferation and viability was
assessed by MTT assay. The expression of different AP-1 factors was analyzed by
semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The cells treated with E2 found to increase the cell
proliferation by more than 35 % and TMX an antiestrogen decreased by 29 %
compared to control. The E2 found to induce the expression of c-Jun, Fra-1, and
c-Fos, while TMX decreased the expression. In addition TMX also decreased the
mRNA levels of Jun-D and Fra-2. These results suggest that the AP-1 factors
c-Jun, c-Fos, and Fra-1 may be involved in the proliferation and transformation
of MCF-7 cells. E2 also found to induce cyclin D1 and cyclin E1 mRNA transcripts 
of cell cycle regulators while TMX significantly decreased compared to control.
Further E2 induced the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and TMX decreased mRNA transcripts.
The data presented here support the E2-ERa-mediated MCF-7 cell proliferation and 
confirms the role of AP-1 factors in cell cycle regulation.

Genistein is a well known flavonoid that exhibits antioxidant, antiproliferative,
proapoptotic, antiangiogenic, as well as estrogenic and anti-estrogenic activity.
Extensive studies in the field of dermatology and cosmetology in recent years
revealed that genistein is a promising anti-aging, anti-photoaging and
anti-carcinogenic agent for skin care. Essential role in skin prematuring aging
and carcinogenesis play AP-1 transcription factors that are activated, among
others, by environmental factors: ultraviolet light and free radicals. Genistein 
is a potent antioxidant and inhibitor of AP-1 activity. The aim of the study was 
to investigate genistein as a potential regulator of C-JUN, C-FOS and FOS-B of
AP-1 subunits expression in skin keratinocytes, fibroblasts and keloid
fibroblasts cultured in vitro. In presented study, genistein modulated C-JUN
expression in epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts cultured in vitro.
The expression of C-JUN was higher in keratinocytes treated with 37 and 370
microM genistein. In dermal fibroblasts genistein regulated C-JUN expression in
dose-dependent manner. The expression of C-JUN was lower in fibroblasts treated
with 370 microM genistein and higher in fibroblasts treated with 37 microM
genistein. Genistein in 370 microM concentration inhibited C-FOS expression in
fibroblasts, whereas in 370 and 37 microM concentration genistein inhibited FOS-B
expression in keratinocytes. Furthermore, genistein was able to modulate C-JUN
and C-FOS genes expression in keloid fibroblasts cultured in vitro. In these
cells, transcriptional activity of C-JUN and C-FOS expression depended on
employed concentration of genistein. The expression of C-JUN and C-FOS was higher
in keloid fibroblasts treated with 370 microM genistein and lower in keloid
fibroblasts treated with 37 microM genistein.

IL-4 inhibition of IL-1 induced Matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) expression in 
human fibroblasts involves decreased AP-1 activation via negative crosstalk

Matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) over-expression is associated with tissue
destruction in the context of chronic inflammation. Previous studies showed that 
IL-4 inhibits induction of MMP-3 by IL-1ß, and suggested that AP-1 might be
involved. Here we show that IL-1 induced binding of transcription factor AP-1 to 
the MMP-3 promoter consists primarily of c-Jun, JunB, and c-Fos and that binding 
of c-Jun and c-Fos is inhibited by the combination of cytokines while binding of 
Jun B is not. Mutation of the AP-1 site in the MMP-3 promoter decreased the
ability of IL-4 to inhibit its transcription in transfected MG-63 cells. Western 
blotting showed that both cytokines activate Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but
with somewhat different kinetics, and that activation of JNK by both cytokines
individually is inhibited by the combination. These results indicate that IL-4
inhibition of MMP-3 expression is associated with reduction of IL-1 induced
binding of active forms of the AP-1 dimer, while less active JunB-containing
dimers remain, and suggest that these changes are associated with decreased
activation of JNK.

The ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) plays an important role in
feeding and energy homeostasis. Electroconvulsive seizure (ECS) therapy is highly
effective in the treatment of several psychiatric diseases, including depression,
but may also have beneficial effects in other neurological diseases. Although it 
has been reported that the neurons of the VMH are strongly activated by ECS
stimulation, the specific effects of ECS in this hypothalamic subnucleus remain
unknown. To address this issue, we investigated the changes in gene expression in
microdissected-VMH samples in response to ECS in mice, and examined the
behavioral effects of ECS on feeding behavior. ECS significantly induced the
expression of immediate-early genes such as Fos, Fosb, and Jun, as well as Bdnf, 
Adcyap1, Hrh1, and Crhr2 in the VMH. Given that signals of these gene products
are suggested to have anorexigenic roles in the VMH, we also examined the effect 
of ECS on food intake and body weight. Repeated ECS had a suppressive effect on
food intake and body weight gain under both regular and high-fat diet conditions.
Furthermore, gold-thioglucose-induced hypothalamic lesions, including the VMH and
the arcuate nucleus, abolished the anorexigenic effects of ECS, indicating the
requirement for the activation of the hypothalamus. Our data show an effect of
ECS on increased expression of anorexigenic factors in the VMH, and suggest a
role in the regulation of energy homeostasis by ECS.

striatal up-regulation of <U+0394>FosB in mice.

Chronic administration of ethanol induces persistent accumulation of <U+0394>FosB, an
important transcription factor, in the midbrain dopamine system. This process
underlies the progression to addiction. Previously, we have shown that cytisine, 
a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) partial agonist, reduces
various ethanol-drinking behaviors and ethanol-induced striatal dopamine
function. However, the effects of cytisine on chronic ethanol drinking and
ethanol-induced up-regulation of striatal <U+0394>FosB are not known. Therefore, we
examined the effects of cytisine on chronic voluntary ethanol consumption and
associated striatal <U+0394>FosB up-regulation in C57BL/6J mice using behavioral and
biochemical methods. Following the chronic voluntary consumption of 15% (v/v)
ethanol under a 24-h two-bottle choice intermittent access (IA; 3 sessions/week) 
or continuous access (CA; 24 h/d and 7 d/week) paradigm, mice received repeated
intraperitoneal injections of saline or cytisine (0.5 or 3.0 mg/kg). Ethanol and 
water intake were monitored for 24 h post-treatment. Pretreatment with cytisine
(0.5 or 1.5 mg/kg) significantly reduced ethanol consumption and preference in
both paradigms at 2 h and 24 h post-treatment. The <U+0394>FosB levels in the ventral
and dorsal striatum were determined by Western blotting 18-24 h after the last
point of ethanol access. In addition, cytisine (0.5 mg/kg) significantly
attenuated up-regulation of <U+0394>FosB in the ventral and dorsal striatum following
chronic ethanol consumption in IA and CA paradigms. The results indicate that
cytisine modulates chronic voluntary ethanol consumption and reduces
ethanol-induced up-regulation of striatal <U+0394>FosB. Further, the data suggest a
critical role of nAChRs in chronic ethanol-induced neurochemical adaptations
associated with ethanol addiction.

Protein kinase G regulates dopamine release, <U+0394>FosB expression, and locomotor
activity after repeated cocaine administration: involvement of dopamine D2

Protein kinase G (PKG) activation has been implicated in the regulation of
synaptic plasticity in the brain. This study was conducted to determine the
involvement of PKG-associated dopamine D2 (D2) receptors in the regulation of
dopamine release, <U+0394>FosB expression and locomotor activity in response to repeated
cocaine exposure. Repeated systemic injections of cocaine (20 mg/kg), once a day 
for seven consecutive days, increased cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and
extracellular dopamine concentrations in the dorsal striatum. Inhibition of
neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), cGMP or PKG and stimulation of D2
receptors decreased the repeated cocaine-induced increase in dopamine
concentrations. Similar results were obtained by the combining nNOS, cGMP or PKG 
inhibition with stimulation of D2 receptors. Parallel to these data, PKG
inhibition, D2 receptor stimulation, and combining PKG inhibition with
stimulation of D2 receptors decreased the repeated cocaine-induced increases in
<U+0394>FosB expression and locomotor activity. These findings suggest that control of
D2 receptors by PKG activation after repeated cocaine is responsible for
upregulating dopamine release and sustained long-term changes in gene expression 
in the dopamine terminals and gamma-aminobutyric acid neurons of the dorsal
striatum, respectively. This upregulation may contribute to behavioral changes in
response to repeated exposure to cocaine.

of rats.

Nicotine and methamphetamine (METH) cause addiction by triggering neuroplastic
changes in brain reward pathways though they each engage distinct molecular
targets (nicotine receptors and dopamine transporters respectively). Addiction to
both drugs is very prevalent, with the vast majority of METH users also being
smokers of cigarettes. This co-morbid occurrence thus raised questions about
potential synergistic rewarding effects of the drugs. However, few studies have
investigated the chronic neurobiological changes associated with co-morbid
nicotine and METH addiction. Here we investigated the effects of these two drugs 
alone and in combination on the expression of several immediate early genes
(IEGs) that are sensitive to drug exposures. Chronic exposure to either nicotine 
or METH caused significant decreases in the expression of fosb, fra1, and fra2 in
the nucleus accumbens (NAc) but not in the dorsal striatum whereas the drug
combination increased fra2 expression in both structures. Except for junB mRNA
levels that were decreased by the three drug treatments in the NAc, there were no
significant changes in the Jun family members. Of the Egr family members, NAc
egr2 expression was decreased after nicotine and the drug combination whereas NAc
egr3 was decreased after METH and the drug combination. The drug combination also
increased striatal egr3 expression. The Nr4a family member, nr4a2/nurr1, showed
increased striatal expression after all three drug treatments, while striatal
nr4a3/nor-1 expression was increased by the drug combination whereas NAc
nr4a1/nurr77 was decreased by nicotine and the drug combination. These
observations suggest that, when given in combination, the two drugs exert
distinct effects on the expression of IEGs in dopaminergic projection areas from 
those elicited by each drug alone. The significance of these changes in IEG
expression and in other molecular markers in fostering co-morbid METH and
nicotine abuse needs to be further evaluated.

Chronically available alcohol escalates drinking in mice and a single injection
of the immune activator lipopolysaccharide can mimic this effect and result in a 
persistent increase in alcohol consumption. We hypothesized that chronic alcohol 
drinking and lipopolysaccharide injections will produce some similar molecular
changes that play a role in regulation of alcohol intake. We investigated the
molecular mechanisms of chronic alcohol consumption or lipopolysaccharide insult 
by gene expression profiling in prefrontal cortex and liver of C57BL/6J mice. We 
identified similar patterns of transcriptional changes among four groups of
animals, three consuming alcohol (vs water) in different consumption tests and
one injected with lipopolysaccharide (vs. vehicle). The three tests of alcohol
consumption are the continuous chronic two bottle choice (Chronic), two bottle
choice available every other day (Chronic Intermittent) and limited access to one
bottle of ethanol (Drinking in the Dark). Gene expression changes were more
numerous and marked in liver than in prefrontal cortex for the alcohol treatments
and similar in the two tissues for lipopolysaccharide. Many of the changes were
unique to each treatment, but there was significant overlap in prefrontal cortex 
for Chronic-Chronic Intermittent and for Chronic Intermittent-lipopolysaccharide 
and in liver all pairs showed overlap. In silico cell-type analysis indicated
that lipopolysaccharide had strongest effects on brain microglia and liver
Kupffer cells. Pathway analysis detected a prefrontal cortex-based
dopamine-related (PPP1R1B, DRD1, DRD2, FOSB, PDNY) network that was highly
over-represented in the Chronic Intermittent group, with several genes from the
network being also regulated in the Chronic and lipopolysaccharide (but not
Drinking in the Dark) groups. Liver showed a CYP and GST centered metabolic
network shared in part by all four treatments. We demonstrate common consequences
of chronic alcohol consumption and immune activation in both liver and brain and 
show distinct genomic consequences of different types of alcohol consumption.

Perturbation of transcription factor Nur77 expression mediated by myocyte
enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D) regulates dopaminergic neuron loss in response to
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).

We have earlier reported the critical nature of calpain-CDK5-MEF2 signaling in
governing dopaminergic neuronal loss in vivo. CDK5 mediates phosphorylation of
the neuronal survival factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) leading to its
inactivation and loss. However, the downstream factors that mediate
MEF2-regulated survival are unknown. Presently, we define Nur77 as one such
critical downstream survival effector. Following
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatment in vivo, Nur77
expression in the nigrostriatal region is dramatically reduced. This loss is
attenuated by expression of MEF2. Importantly, MEF2 constitutively binds to the
Nur77 promoter in neurons under basal conditions. This binding is lost following 
1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium treatment. Nur77 deficiency results in significant
sensitization to dopaminergic loss following 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium/MPTP
treatment, in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Nur77-deficient MPTP-treated mice
displayed significantly reduced levels of dopamine and 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic 
acid in the striatum as well as elevated post synaptic FosB activity, indicative 
of increased nigrostriatal damage when compared with WT MPTP-treated controls.
Importantly, this sensitization in Nur77-deficient mice was rescued with ectopic 
Nur77 expression in the nigrostriatal system. These results indicate that the
inactivation of Nur77, induced by loss of MEF2 activity, plays a critical role in
nigrostriatal degeneration in vivo.

Renal ischemia produces sympathoexcitation, which is responsible for the
development of ischemic acute kidney injury. Stimulation of central opioid
receptors activates the renal sympathetic nerve. The present study examined the
effect of an opioid receptor antagonist naloxone on the
ischemia/reperfusion-induced renal dysfunction in mice. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
and plasma creatinine increased 24 h after the renal ischemia/reperfusion.
Intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular, but not intrathecal, pretreatment
with naloxone suppressed the renal ischemia/reperfusion-induced increases in BUN 
and plasma creatinine. This effect of naloxone was reversed by subcutaneous
pretreatment with morphine. Selective MOP receptor antagonist ß-funaltrexamine
(FNA) also suppressed the renal ischemia/reperfusion-induced increases in BUN and
plasma creatinine. Moreover, tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the renal tissue 
increased 24 h after renal ischemia/reperfusion, which was abolished by
intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular pretreatment with naloxone and FNA.
Immunohistochemical experiments revealed a significant increase in the number of 
the Fos family proteins (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2) positive cells in the
paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus and supraoptic nucleus 24 h after the
renal ischemia/reperfusion. Intracerebroventricular pretreatment with naloxone
attenuated the renal ischemia/reperfusion-induced increase in the number of the
Fos family proteins positive cells in these areas. Finally, we observed that
i.c.v. pretreatment with antiserum against ß-endorphin also suppressed the
increased blood urea and plasma creatinine. These results suggest that the
blockade of central opioid receptors can attenuate the ischemic acute kidney
injury through the inhibition of renal sympathoexcitation. The central opioid
receptors may thus be a new target for the treatment of ischemic organ failures.

Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen cultured from diabetic foot
infection (DFI). The consequence of its spread to soft tissue and bony structures
is a major causal factor for lower-limb amputation. The objective of the study
was to explore ecological data and epidemiological characteristics of S. aureus
strains isolated from DFI in an Algerian hospital setting. Patients were included
if they were admitted for DFI in the Department of Diabetology at the Annaba
University Hospital from April 2011 to March 2012. Ulcers were classified
according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America/International Working
Group on the Diabetic Foot classification system. All S. aureus isolates were
analysed. Using oligonucleotide arrays, S. aureus resistance and virulence genes 
were determined and each isolate was affiliated to a clonal complex. Among the
128 patients, 277 strains were isolated from 183 samples (1.51 isolate per
sample). Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli were the most common isolated organisms
(54.9% of all isolates). The study of ecological data highlighted the extremely
high rate of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) (58.5% of all isolates). The
situation was especially striking for S. aureus [(85.9% were
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)], Klebsiella pneumonia (83.8%) and
Escherichia coli (60%). Among the S. aureus isolates, 82.2% of MRSA belonged to
ST239, one of the most worldwide disseminated clones. Ten strains (13.7%)
belonged to the European clone PVL+ ST80. ermA, aacA-aphD, aphA, tetM, fosB, sek,
seq, lukDE, fnbB, cap8 and agr group 1 genes were significantly associated with
MRSA strains (p <0.01). The study shows for the first time the alarming
prevalence of MDROs in DFI in Algeria.

Loading can stimulate tendon healing. In healing rat Achilles tendons, we have
found more than 150 genes upregulated or downregulated 3 h after one loading
episode. We hypothesized that these changes were preceded by a smaller number of 
regulatory genes and thus performed a microarray 15 min after a short loading
episode, to capture the primary response to loading. We transected the Achilles
tendon of 54 rats and allowed them to heal. The hind limbs were unloaded by
tail-suspension during the entire experiment, except during the loading episode. 
The healing tendon tissue was analyzed by mechanical testing, microarray, and
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Mechanical testing
showed that 5 min of loading each day for 4 days created stronger tissue. The
microarray analysis after one loading episode identified 15 regulated genes. Ten 
genes were analyzed in a repeat experiment with new rats using qRT-PCR. This
confirmed the increased expression of four genes: early growth response 2 (Egr2),
c-Fos, FosB, and regulation of G protein signaling 1 (Rgs1). The other genes were
unaltered. We also analyzed the expression of early growth response 1 (Egr1),
which is often co-regulated with c-Fos or Egr2, and found that this was also
increased after loading. Egr1, Egr2, c-Fos, and FosB are transcription factors
that can be triggered by numerous stimuli. However, Egr1 and Egr2 are necessary
for normal tendon development, and can induce ectopic expression of tendon
markers. The five regulated genes appear to constitute a general activation
machinery. The further development of gene regulation might depend on the tissue 
context.

Perinatal asphyxia (PA) increases the likelihood of suffering from
dopamine-related disorders, such as ADHD and schizophrenia. Since dopaminergic
transmission plays a major role in cocaine sensitization, the purpose of this
study was to determine whether PA could be associated with altered behavioral
sensitization to cocaine. To this end, adult rats born vaginally (CTL), by
caesarean section (C+), or by C+ with 15 min (PA15, moderate PA) or 19 min (PA19,
severe PA) of global anoxia were repeatedly administered with cocaine (i.p., 15
mg/kg) and then challenged with cocaine (i.p., 15 mg/kg) after a 5-day withdrawal
period. In addition, c-Fos, FosB/<U+0394>FosB, DAT, and TH expression were assessed in
dorsal (CPu) and ventral (NAcc) striatum. Results indicated that PA15 rats
exhibited an increased locomotor sensitization to cocaine, while PA19 rats
displayed an abnormal acquisition of locomotor sensitization and did not express 
a sensitized response to cocaine. c-Fos expression in NAcc, but not in CPu, was
associated with these alterations in cocaine sensitization. FosB/<U+0394>FosB expression
was increased in all groups and regions after repeated cocaine administration,
although it reached lower expression levels in PA19 rats. In CTL, C+, and PA15,
but not in PA19 rats, the expression of TH in NAcc was reduced in groups
repeatedly treated with cocaine, independently of the challenge test.
Furthermore, this reduction was more pronounced in PA15 rats. DAT expression
remained unaltered in all groups and regions studied. These results suggest that 
moderate PA may increase the vulnerability to drug abuse and in particular to
cocaine addiction.

Protein kinase G (PKG) has been implicated in a variety of physiological
functions including synaptic plasticity in the brain. This study investigated the
involvement of dopamine D3 (D3) receptors in PKG-regulated dopamine release,
long-term changes in gene expression and behavioral sensitization after repeated 
cocaine administration. Repeated systemic injections of cocaine (20mg/kg), once a
day for seven consecutive days, increased extracellular dopamine concentrations
in the dorsal striatum. Inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase, cGMP or
PKG, stimulation of D3 receptors, and simultaneous inhibition of each of them
with D3 receptor stimulation decreased the repeated cocaine-induced increase in
dopamine concentrations and locomotor activity. Similarly, inhibition of PKG and 
simultaneous inhibition of PKG with D3 receptor stimulation decreased <U+0394>FosB
immunoreactivity elevated by repeated cocaine administration, however stimulation
of D3 receptors alone did not. These findings suggest that activation of PKG
after repeated cocaine administration is more sensitive to interact with D3
receptors in the dopamine terminals than those in medium spiny neurons. This
interaction may result in the development of behavioral sensitization by the
upregulation of dopamine releases in the dorsal striatum.

Rodents with lesion of dopaminergic pathway when receiving repeated
l-3,4-dihydroxiphenylalanine (l-DOPA) treatment develop abnormal involuntary
movements called dyskinesia. We demonstrated that nitric oxide synthase (NOS)
inhibitors mitigate l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in rodents. The aim of the present 
study was to verify if the in vivo preferential neuronal NOS (nNOS) inhibitor
7-nitroindazole (7-NI) affect the expression of the transcription factor
FosB/<U+0394>FosB in the lesioned striatum, an indicator of neuronal activity associated
with dyskinesia. Male Wistar rats with unilateral microinjection (medial
forebrain bundle) of either the neurotoxin 6-hydroxidopamine (6-OHDA;
n=4-6/group) or saline (sham; n=6/group) were provided with l-DOPA (30mg/kg plus 
benserazide 7.5mg/kg/day, oral gavage), once a day during 22 days.
6-OHDA-lesioned animals developed abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs)
classified as axial, limb, orofacial and locomotive dyskinesia and presented
FosB/<U+0394>FosB increase in the dopamine-depleted striatum. Administration of 7-NI
(30mg/kg, i.p.), 30min prior to l-DOPA reduced the severity of AIMs (˜65% for
axial, limb and orofacial and 74% for locomotive AIMs scores), without
interfering with the rotarod performance. Simultaneously, 7-NI attenuated the
expression of FosB/<U+0394>FosB in dopamine-depleted striatum (˜65% in medial and ˜54%
in lateral striatum, bregma 0.48mm). FosB/<U+0394>FosB expression in lateral striatum
was correlated with l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. The findings described here
corroborate a new approach to the management of l-DOPA-therapy in Parkinson's
disease (PD) treatment.

Drugs of abuse induce neuroplasticity in the natural reward pathway, specifically
the nucleus accumbens (NAc), thereby causing development and expression of
addictive behavior. Recent evidence suggests that natural rewards may cause
similar changes in the NAc, suggesting that drugs may activate mechanisms of
plasticity shared with natural rewards, and allowing for unique interplay between
natural and drug rewards. In this study, we demonstrate that sexual experience in
male rats when followed by short or prolonged periods of loss of sex reward
causes enhanced amphetamine reward, indicated by sensitized conditioned place
preference for low-dose (0.5 mg/kg) amphetamine. Moreover, the onset, but not the
longer-term expression, of enhanced amphetamine reward was correlated with a
transient increase in dendritic spines in the NAc. Next, a critical role for the 
transcription factor <U+0394>FosB in sex experience-induced enhanced amphetamine reward 
and associated increases in dendritic spines on NAc neurons was established using
viral vector gene transfer of the dominant-negative binding partner <U+0394>JunD.
Moreover, it was demonstrated that sexual experience-induced enhanced drug
reward, <U+0394>FosB, and spinogenesis are dependent on mating-induced dopamine D1
receptor activation in the NAc. Pharmacological blockade of D1 receptor, but not 
D2 receptor, in the NAc during sexual behavior attenuated <U+0394>FosB induction and
prevented increased spinogenesis and sensitized amphetamine reward. Together,
these findings demonstrate that drugs of abuse and natural reward behaviors act
on common molecular and cellular mechanisms of plasticity that control
vulnerability to drug addiction, and that this increased vulnerability is
mediated by <U+0394>FosB and its downstream transcriptional targets.

formation. Intermittent PTH (1-34) administration stimulates bone formation and
counteracts the inhibition of bone formation by GC excess. We have previously
demonstrated that mechanical strain enhances interleukin (IL)-11 gene
transcription by a rapid induction of <U+0394>FosB expression and protein kinase C
(PKC)-d-mediated phosphorylation of phosphorylated mothers against
decapentaplegic (Smad)-1. Because IL-11 suppresses the expression of dickkopf-1
and -2 and stimulates Wnt signaling, IL-11 appears to mediate at least a part of 
the effect of mechanical strain on osteoblast differentiation and bone formation.
The present study was undertaken to examine the effect of PTH(1-34) and GCs on
IL-11 expression in murine primary osteoblasts (mPOBs). PTH(1-34) treatment of
mPOBs enhanced IL-11 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. PTH(1-34)
also stimulated <U+0394>FosB expression and Smad1 phosphorylation, which cooperatively
stimulated IL-11 gene transcription. PTH(1-34)-induced Smad1 phosphorylation was 
mediated via PKCd and was abrogated in mPOBs from PKCd knockout mice.
Dexamethasone suppressed IL-11 gene transcription enhanced by PTH(1-34) without
affecting <U+0394>FosB expression or Smad1 phosphorylation, and dexamethasone-GC
receptor complex was bound to JunD, which forms heterodimers with <U+0394>FosB. High
doses of PTH(1-34) counteracted the effect of dexamethasone on apoptosis of
mPOBs, which was blunted by neutralizing anti-IL-11 antibody or IL-11 small
interfering RNA. These results demonstrate that PTH(1-34) and GCs interact to
regulate IL-11 expression in parallel with osteoblast differentiation and
apoptosis and suggest that PTH(1-34) and dexamethasone may regulate osteoblast
differentiation and apoptosis via their effect on IL-11 expression.

In cells starved for leucine, lysine or glutamine heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is
inactivated and the level of the transcripts of the HSF1 target genes HSPA1A
(Hsp70) and DNAJB1 (Hsp40) drops. We show here that in HEK293 cells deprived of
methionine HSF1 was similarly inactivated but that the level of HSPA1A and DNAJB1
mRNA increased. This increase was also seen in cells expressing a dominant
negative HSF1 mutant (HSF379 or HSF1-K80Q), confirming that the increase is HSF1 
independent. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine completely inhibited the increase
in HSPA1A and DNAJB1 mRNA levels upon methionine starvation, indicating that this
increase is a response to oxidative stress resulting from a lack of methionine.
Cells starved for methionine contained higher levels of c-Fos and FosB mRNA, but 
knockdown of these transcription factors had no effect on the HSPA1A or DNAJB1
mRNA level. Knockdown of NRF2 mRNA resulted in the inhibition of the increase in 
the HSPA1A mRNA, but not the DNAJB1 mRNA, level in methionine starved cells. We
conclude that methionine deprivation results in both the amino acid deprivation
response and an antioxidant response mediated at least in part by NRF2. This
antioxidant response includes an HSF1 independent increase in the levels of
HSPA1A and DNAJB1 mRNA.

binding HSF1 mutant.

To assess the consequences of inactivation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) during
aging, we analyzed the effect of HSF1 K80Q, a mutant unable to bind DNA, and of
dnHSF1, a mutant lacking the activation domain, on the transcriptome of cells 6
and 24 h after heat shock. The primary response to heat shock (6 h recovery), of 
which 30 % was HSF1-dependent, had decayed 24 h after heat shock in control cells
but was extended in HSF1 K80Q and dnHSF1 cells. Comparison with literature data
showed that even the HSF1 dependent primary stress response is largely cell
specific. HSF1 K80Q, but not HSF1 siRNA-treated, cells showed a delayed stress
response: an increase in transcript levels of HSF1 target genes 24 h after heat
stress. Knockdown of NRF2, but not of ATF4, c-Fos or FosB, inhibited this delayed
stress response. EEF1D_L siRNA inhibited both the delayed and the extended
primary stress responses, but had off target effects. In control cells an
antioxidant response (ARE binding, HMOX1 mRNA levels) was detected 6 h after heat
shock; in HSF1 K80Q cells this response was delayed to 24 h and the ARE complex
had a different mobility. Inactivation of HSF1 thus affects the timing and nature
of the antioxidant response and NRF2 can activate at least some HSF1 target genes
in the absence of HSF1 activity.

function.

Synaptic modifications in nucleus accumbens (NAc) medium spiny neurons (MSNs)
play a key role in adaptive and pathological reward-dependent learning, including
maladaptive responses involved in drug addiction. NAc MSNs participate in two
parallel circuits, direct and indirect pathways that subserve distinct behavioral
functions. Modification of NAc MSN synapses may occur in part via changes in the 
transcriptional potential of certain genes in a cell type–specific manner. The
transcription factor <U+2206>FosB is one of the key proteins implicated in the gene
expression changes in NAc caused by drugs of abuse, yet its effects on synaptic
function in NAc MSNs are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of
<U+2206>FosB decreased excitatory synaptic strength and likely increased silent synapses
onto D1 dopamine receptor–expressing direct pathway MSNs in both the NAc shell
and core. In contrast, <U+2206>FosB likely decreased silent synapses onto NAc shell, but
not core, D2 dopamine receptor–expressing indirect pathway MSNs. Analysis of NAc 
MSN dendritic spine morphology revealed that <U+2206>FosB increased the density of
immature spines in D1 direct but not D2 indirect pathway MSNs. To determine the
behavioral consequences of cell type-specific actions of <U+2206>FosB, we selectively
overexpressed <U+2206>FosB in D1 direct or D2 indirect MSNs in NAc in vivo and found
that direct (but not indirect) pathway MSN expression enhances behavioral
responses to cocaine. These results reveal that <U+2206>FosB in NAc differentially
modulates synaptic properties and reward-related behaviors in a cell type- and
subregion-specific fashion.

Patients with epilepsy are at high risk for major depression relative to the
general population, and both disorders are associated with changes in adult
hippocampal neurogenesis, although the mechanisms underlying disease onset remain
unknown. The expression of fosB, an immediate early gene encoding FosB and
<U+0394>FosB/<U+0394>2<U+0394>FosB by alternative splicing and translation initiation, is known to be 
induced in neural progenitor cells within the subventricular zone of the lateral 
ventricles and subgranular zone of the hippocampus, following transient forebrain
ischemia in the rat brain. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated expression of fosB gene 
products can promote neural stem cell proliferation. We recently found that
fosB-null mice show increased depressive behavior, suggesting impaired
neurogenesis in fosB-null mice. In the current study, we analyzed neurogenesis in
the hippocampal dentate gyrus of fosB-null and fosB(d/d) mice that express
<U+0394>FosB/<U+0394>2<U+0394>FosB but not FosB, in comparison with wild-type mice, alongside
neuropathology, behaviors, and gene expression profiles. fosB-null but not
fosB(d/d) mice displayed impaired neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus and
spontaneous epilepsy. Microarray analysis revealed that genes related to
neurogenesis, depression, and epilepsy were altered in the hippocampus of
fosB-null mice. Thus, we conclude that the fosB-null mouse is the first animal
model to provide a genetic and molecular basis for the comorbidity between
depression and epilepsy with abnormal neurogenesis, all of which are caused by
loss of a single gene, fosB.

The development of dyskinesias following chronic L-DOPA replacement therapy
remains a major problem in the long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease. This
study aimed at evaluating the effect of IRC-082451 (base of BN82451), a novel
multitargeting hybrid molecule, on L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) and
hypolocomotor activity in a non-human primate model of PD. IRC-082451 displays
multiple properties: it inhibits neuronal excitotoxicity (sodium channel
blocker), oxidative stress (antioxidant) and neuroinflammation (cyclooxygenase
inhibitor) and is endowed with mitochondrial protective properties. Animals
received daily MPTP injections until stably parkinsonian. A daily treatment with 
increasing doses of L-DOPA was administered to parkinsonian primates until the
appearance of dyskinesias. Then, different treatment regimens and doses of
IRC-082451 were tested and compared to the benchmark molecule amantadine.
Primates were regularly filmed and videos were analyzed with specialized
software. A novel approach combining the analysis of dyskinesias and locomotor
activity was used to determine efficacy. This analysis yielded the quantification
of the total distance travelled and the incidence of dyskinesias in 7 different
body parts. A dose-dependent efficacy of IRC-082451 against dyskinesias was
observed. The 5 mg/kg dose was best at attenuating the severity of fully
established LIDs. Its effect was significantly different from that of amantadine 
since it increased spontaneous locomotor activity while reducing LIDs. This dose 
was effective both acutely and in a 5-day sub-chronic treatment. Moreover,
positron emission tomography scans using radiolabelled dopamine demonstrated that
there was no direct interference between treatment with IRC-082451 and dopamine
metabolism in the brain. Finally, post-mortem analysis indicated that this
reduction in dyskinesias was associated with changes in cFOS, FosB and ARC mRNA
expression levels in the putamen. The data demonstrates the antidyskinetic
efficacy of IRC-082451 in a primate model of PD with motor complications and
opens the way to the clinical application of this treatment for the management of
LIDs.

Augmentation of extinction with learning enhancing therapy may offer an effective
strategy to combat heroin relapse. Our lab previously found that
electroacupuncture (EA) not only significantly reduced cue-induced reinstatement 
of heroin seeking but also exhibited a promoting effect on the ability of
learning and memory. In the present study, we further investigated the effects of
EA on the extinction of heroin-seeking behavior in rats with a history of
intravenous heroin self-administration. We trained Sprague-Dawley rats to
nose-poke for i.v. heroin either daily for 4h or 25 infusions for 14 consecutive 
days; then the rats underwent 7 daily 3h extinction sessions in the operant
chamber. To assess EA's effects on the extinction response of heroin-associated
cues, 2Hz EA was administered 1h before each of the 7 extinction sessions. We
also applied immunohistochemistry to detect FosB-positive nuclei in the nucleus
accumbens core. We found that EA treatment facilitated the extinction response of
heroin seeking but did not alter the locomotor activity in an open field testing 
environment. EA stimulation attenuated the FosB expression in the core of the
nucleus accumbens, a brain region involved in the learning and execution of motor
responses. Altogether, these results suggest that EA may provide a novel
nonpharmacological approach to enhance extinction learning when combined with
extinction therapy for the treatment of heroin addiction.

AP-1 (activator protein-1) is composed of Jun and Fos proteins and functions in
cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. Previous studies have
demonstrated that different AP-1 complexes participate in the determination of
various cell fates. However, the role of different AP-1 complexes during early
vertebrate development is not yet fully understood. In the present study, we
demonstrate that AP-1(c-Jun/FosB) regulates neurogenesis via FoxD5b expression.
We show that FoxD5 was induced by the inhibition of BMP and that FoxD5b plays
roles in neurogenesis. Additionally, we show that the FoxD5b promoter region
within -1336 and -1316 contains an AP-1 binding site, which is required for the
transcriptional regulation of FoxD5b and is induced by the inhibition of BMP
signaling in animal cap explants. Moreover, c-Jun, a component of AP-1, directly 
binds to the AP-1 binding site of the FoxD5b promoter and induces FoxD5b
expression cooperatively with FosB, but not with c-Fos or Fra-1. Altogether,
these results suggest that AP-1(c-Jun/FosB) may play a role in neurogenesis via
the induction of FoxD5b expression during early vertebrate development.

Mechanistic studies of FosB: a divalent-metal-dependent
bacillithiol-S-transferase that mediates fosfomycin resistance in Staphylococcus 
aureus.

FosB is a divalent-metal-dependent thiol-S-transferase implicated in fosfomycin
resistance among many pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. In the present paper, we
describe detailed kinetic studies of FosB from Staphylococcus aureus (SaFosB)
that confirm that bacillithiol (BSH) is its preferred physiological thiol
substrate. SaFosB is the first to be characterized among a new class of enzyme
(bacillithiol-S-transferases), which, unlike glutathione transferases, are
distributed among many low-G+C Gram-positive bacteria that use BSH instead of
glutathione as their major low-molecular-mass thiol. The K(m) values for BSH and 
fosfomycin are 4.2 and 17.8 mM respectively. Substrate specificity assays
revealed that the thiol and amino groups of BSH are essential for activity,
whereas malate is important for SaFosB recognition and catalytic efficiency.
Metal activity assays indicated that Mn(2+) and Mg(2+) are likely to be the
relevant cofactors under physiological conditions. The serine analogue of BSH
(BOH) is an effective competitive inhibitor of SaFosB with respect to BSH, but
uncompetitive with respect to fosfomycin. Coupled with NMR characterization of
the reaction product (BS-fosfomycin), this demonstrates that the SaFosB-catalysed
reaction pathway involves a compulsory ordered binding mechanism with fosfomycin 
binding first followed by BSH which then attacks the more sterically hindered C-1
carbon of the fosfomycin epoxide. Disruption of BSH biosynthesis in S. aureus
increases sensitivity to fosfomycin. Together, these results indicate that SaFosB
is a divalent-metal-dependent bacillithiol-S-transferase that confers fosfomycin 
resistance on S. aureus.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a family of small nonprotein-coding RNAs, play a critical
role in posttranscriptional gene regulation by acting as adaptors for the
miRNA-induced silencing complex to inhibit gene expression by targeting mRNAs for
translational repression and/or cleavage. miR-155-5p and miR-155-3p are processed
from the B-cell Integration Cluster (BIC) gene (now designated, MIR155 host gene 
or MIR155HG). MiR-155-5p is highly expressed in both activated B- and T-cells and
in monocytes/macrophages. MiR-155-5p is one of the best characterized miRNAs and 
recent data indicate that miR-155-5p plays a critical role in various
physiological and pathological processes such as hematopoietic lineage
differentiation, immunity, inflammation, viral infections, cancer, cardiovascular
disease, and Down syndrome. In this review we summarize the mechanisms by which
MIR155HG expression can be regulated. Given that the pathologies mediated by
miR-155-5p result from the over-expression of this miRNA it may be possible to
therapeutically attenuate miR-155-5p levels in the treatment of several
pathological processes.

Adaptations in brain reward circuitry underlie palatable food cravings and
anxiety induced by high-fat diet withdrawal.

(1)CRCHUM and Montreal Diabetes Research Centre; Department of Nutrition, Faculty
of Medicine, Université de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the emotional and motivational processes that reinstate
palatable food intake following removal of high-fat diet (HFD) and associated
neuroadaptations tied to neurochemical and behavioural changes underlying
dopaminergic function.
METHODS: Adult male C57Bl6 mice were placed on a HFD (58% kcal fat) or
ingredient-matched, low-fat diet (LFD; 11% kcal fat) for 6 weeks. At the end of
diet-regimen mice were either maintained on their respective diets, or HFD and
LFD were replaced with normal chow (withdrawal). Effort-based operant responding 
for sucrose and high-fat food rewards was measured along with basal and
stress-induced corticosterone levels and anxiety (elevated-plus maze). Protein
levels for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), corticosterone releasing factor type 1
receptor (CRF-R1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phospho-CREB (pCREB)
and <U+0394>FosB (truncated splice variant of FosB) were assessed in the amygdala,
nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) via western
immunoblotting.
RESULTS: Six weeks of HFD resulting in significant weight gain elicited sucrose
anhedonia, anxiety-like behaviour and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis 
(HPA) hypersensitivity to stress. Withdrawal from HFD but not LFD-potentiated
anxiety and basal corticosterone levels and enhanced motivation for sucrose and
high-fat food rewards. Chronic high-fat feeding reduced CRF-R1 and increased BDNF
and pCREB protein levels in the amygdala and reduced TH and increased <U+0394>FosB
protein in NAc and VTA. Heightened palatable food reward in mice withdrawn from
HFD coincided with increased BDNF protein levels in NAc and decreased TH and
pCREB expression in the amygdala.
CONCLUSION: Anhedonia, anxiety and sensitivity to stressors develops during the
course of HFD and may have a key role in a vicious cycle that perpetuates
high-fat feeding and the development of obesity. Removal of HFD enhances stress
responses and heightens vulnerability for palatable foods by increasing
food-motivated behaviour. Lasting changes in dopamine and plasticity-related
signals in reward circuitry may promote negative emotional states, overeating and
palatable food relapse.

Glucocorticoids regulation of FosB/<U+0394>FosB expression induced by chronic opiate
exposure in the brain stress system.

Chronic use of drugs of abuse profoundly alters stress-responsive system.
Repeated exposure to morphine leads to accumulation of the transcription factor
<U+0394>FosB, particularly in brain areas associated with reward and stress. The
persistent effects of <U+0394>FosB on target genes may play an important role in the
plasticity induced by drugs of abuse. Recent evidence suggests that
stress-related hormones (e.g., glucocorticoids, GC) may induce adaptations in the
brain stress system that is likely to involve alteration in gene expression and
transcription factors. This study examined the role of GC in regulation of
FosB/<U+0394>FosB in both hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic brain stress systems during
morphine dependence. For that, expression of FosB/<U+0394>FosB was measured in control
(sham-operated) and adrenalectomized (ADX) rats that were made opiate dependent
after ten days of morphine treatment. In sham-operated rats, FosB/<U+0394>FosB was
induced after chronic morphine administration in all the brain stress areas
investigated: nucleus accumbens(shell) (NAc), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis
(BNST), central amygdala (CeA), hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and
nucleus of the solitary tract noradrenergic cell group (NTS-A(2)). Adrenalectomy 
attenuated the increased production of FosB/<U+0394>FosB observed after chronic morphine
exposure in NAc, CeA, and NTS. Furthermore, ADX decreased expression of
FosB/<U+0394>FosB within CRH-positive neurons of the BNST, PVN and CeA. Similar results 
were obtained in NTS-A(2) TH-positive neurons and NAc pro-dynorphin-positive
neurons. These data suggest that neuroadaptation (estimated as accumulation of
FosB/<U+0394>FosB) to opiates in brain areas associated with stress is modulated by GC, 
supporting the evidence of a link between brain stress hormones and addiction.

FOSB gene and papillary thyroid cancer.

The FOSB gene is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and
transformation in several tumor types. We investigated whether coding
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs) and promoter SNPs of FOSB contribute to
the development of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). We also assessed the
associations between FOSB SNPs and the clinicopathological characteristics of
PTC. One coding SNP (rs2282695, Ala39Ala) and one promoter SNP (rs12373539, -158)
in the FOSB gene were genotyped using direct sequencing in 94 PTC patients and
213 healthy controls. Genetic data were analyzed using SNPStats, HelixTree and
SNPAnalyzer. PTC patients were dichotomized and compared with respect to
clinicopathological characteristics of PTC. We detected an association between
PTC and cSNP (rs2282695) in FOSB [codominant model 1 (C/C vs. G/C); OR=1.75; 95% 
CI, 1.04-2.94; P=0.024; codominant model 2 (C/C vs. G/G): OR=2.55; 95% CI,

Log-additive model: OR=1.64; 95% CI, 1.15-2.35; P=0.007]. The G allele was a risk
allele in the geno-type and allele analyses of cSNP (rs2282695) in the FOSB gene 
(OR=1.57; 95% CI, 1.10-2.24; P=0.012). A promoter SNP (rs12373539) in FOSB was
associated with cervical lymph node metastasis of PTC [codominant model 1 (G/G
vs. A/G): OR=0.23; 95% CI, 0.07-0.72; P=0.016; codominant model 2 (G/G vs. A/A):

(OR=0.34; 95% CI, 0.14-0.83; P=0.017). Variation in a FOSB cSNP (rs2282695) may
be associated with risk of PTC. The FOSB promoter SNP (rs12373539) may be
associated with lymph node metastasis of PTC.

Nociceptive information from muscle and skin is differently processed at many
levels of the central nervous system. In most articles on this issue, noxious
stimuli were used that also excited non-nociceptive receptors. The effects of a
pure nociceptive input from muscle or skin on spinal neurones are largely
unknown. The aim of the study was to find out whether the Fos-protein expression 
in dorsal horn neurones induced by an exclusively nociceptive muscle input
differs from that of the skin. Fos-proteins are transcription factors that
regulate neuronal gene expression and induce neuroplastic effects that are
involved in the development of chronic pain. A pure nociceptive input was
achieved by tetrodotoxin (TTX) that is known to block all TTX-sensitive afferents
and leave the TTX-resistant (TTX-r), presumably nociceptive, afferent fibres
intact. We studied the c-Fos and FosB expression in the spinal cord following
electrical stimulation of TTX-r afferent fibres in the gastrocnemius-soleus nerve
(muscle) and compared it to the sural nerve (skin). In the spinal dorsal horn,
the main effect of a TTX-r input from muscle was an increase in FosB (P < 0.05), 
but not in c-Fos expression (P = 0.51). In contrast, an input from the skin
induced both FosB (P < 0.01) and c-Fos expression (P < 0.05). The data indicate
that in the spinal, dorsal horn nociceptive input from skin and muscle has
different effects on the Fos expression. The only effect of muscle input was an
increase in FosB expression while skin input increased both c-Fos and FosB
expression.

Transcription factor complex AP-1 mediates inflammation initiated by Chlamydia
pneumoniae infection.

Chlamydia pneumoniae is responsible for a high prevalence of respiratory
infections worldwide and has been implicated in atherosclerosis. Inflammation is 
regulated by transcription factor (TF) networks. Yet, the core TF network
triggered by chlamydiae remains largely unknown. Primary human coronary artery
endothelial cells were mock-infected or infected with C. pneumoniae to generate
human transcriptome data throughout the chlamydial developmental cycle. Using
systems network analysis, the predominant TF network involved receptor, binding
and adhesion and immune response complexes. Cells transfected with interfering
RNA against activator protein-1 (AP-1) members FOS, FOSB, JUN and JUNB had
significantly decreased expression and protein levels of inflammatory mediators
interleukin (IL)6, IL8, CD38 and tumour necrosis factor compared with controls.
These mediators have been shown to be associated with C. pneumoniae disease.
Expression of AP-1 components was regulated by MAPK3K8, a MAPK pathway component.
Additionally, knock-down of JUN and FOS showed significantly decreased expression
of Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 during infection, implicating JUN and FOS in TLR3
regulation. TLR3 stimulation led to elevated IL8. These findings suggest that C. 
pneumoniae initiates signalling via TLR3 and MAPK that activate AP-1, a known
immune activator in other bacteria not previously shown for chlamydiae,
triggering inflammation linked to C. pneumoniae disease.

Cue-induced heroin seeking after prolonged withdrawal is associated with neuronal
activation and altered gene expression in prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, these
previous studies assessed gene expression in all neurons regardless of their
activity state during heroin seeking. Using Fos as a marker of neural activity,
we describe distinct molecular alterations induced in activated versus
non-activated neurons during cue-induced heroin seeking after prolonged
withdrawal. We trained rats to self-administer heroin for 10 days (6 h/day) and
assessed cue-induced heroin seeking in extinction tests after 14 or 30 days. We
used fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) to purify Fos-positive and
Fos-negative neurons from PFC 90 min after extinction testing. Flow cytometry
showed that Fos-immunoreactivity was increased in less than 10% of sparsely
distributed PFC neurons. mRNA levels of the immediate early genes fosB, arc,
egr1, and egr2, as well as npy and map2k6, were increased in Fos-positive, but
not Fos-negative, neurons. In support of these findings, double-label
immunohistochemistry indicated substantial coexpression of neuropeptide Y (NPY)- 
and Arc-immunoreactivity in Fos-positive neurons. Our data indicate that
cue-induced relapse to heroin seeking after prolonged withdrawal induces unique
molecular alterations within activated PFC neurons that are distinct from those
observed in the surrounding majority of non-activated neurons.

Prostaglandin F2a regulation of mRNA for activating protein 1 transcriptional
factors in porcine corpora lutea (CL): lack of induction of JUN and JUND in CL
without luteolytic capacity.

Diaz FJ(1), Luo W, Wiltbank MC.

Author information: 
(1)Endocrinology-Reproductive Physiology Program, University of
Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706, USA.

Porcine corpora lutea (CL) develop sensitivity to regression by prostaglandin F2a
(PGF2a), termed luteolytic capacity, about 13 d after estrus. We postulated that 
PGF2a regulation of activating protein 1 (AP-1) transcriptional factor expression
underlies acquisition of luteolytic capacity. CL were collected from gilts on day
9 (estrous cycle) or day 17 (pseudopregnancy) before or after PGF2a treatment
with mRNA measured for FOS, FOSB, FOSL1, FOSL2, JUN, JUNB, and JUND and the AP-1 
target genes CCL2 and SERPINE1. At 0.5 h after PGF2a, both day-9 and day-17 CL
had increased (P < 0.01) mRNA for FOS (2,225% and 1,817%), JUNB (237% and 358%), 
and FOSB (1,060% and 925%). Intriguingly, at 0.5 h after PGF2a there was
increased (P < 0.01) mRNA encoding JUN (1,099%) and JUND (300%) in day-17 but not
day-9 CL. At 10 h after PGF2a there was elevated FOSB mRNA in day-17 (771%) but
not day-9 CL and no PGF2a-induced change in FOS, JUN, JUND, and JUNB mRNA in
day-9 or day-17 CL. Treatment with PGF2a increased mRNA for AP-1-responsive
genes, CCL2 at 0.5 h (202%) and CCL2 and SERPINE1 at 10 h (719% and 1,515%), only
in day-17 CL. Thus, many of the fos family of transcription factors are
dramatically induced by PGF2a in CL with or without luteolytic capacity. However,
PGF only induced JUN and JUND expression in CL with luteolytic capacity, a
finding that may be key for understanding the acquisition of luteolytic capacity,
given that JUN is the only AP-1 family member with strong N-terminal
trans-activation activity.

BACKGROUND: Surgical ablation of select brain areas has been frequently used to
alleviate psychological dependence on opiate drugs in certain countries. However,
ablative brain surgery was stopped in China in 2004 due to the related ethical
controversy and possible side effects. Deep brain stimulation (DBS), a less
invasive, reversible and adjustable process of neuromodulation, was adopted to
attenuate relapses in studies of drug addiction.
METHODS: Preclinical experiments were designed to assess the long-term effects of
DBS of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) on cue- and heroin-induced reinstatement of
drug seeking behaviors. After a rat self-administration model of heroin relapse
was established, DBS was administered bilaterally or unilaterally to the NAc core
through concentric bipolar electrodes. A 1-h long continuous stimulation (130 Hz,
100 µs, 0-150 µA) was given daily for 7 days during the abstinence session. Drug 
seeking behaviors were elicited by conditioned cues or a small dose of heroin.
RESULTS: 75 µA and 150 µA bilateral NAc DBS attenuated cue- and heroin-induced
reinstatement of drug seeking, and unilateral DBS of the right NAc achieved
effects almost equivalent to bilateral DBS. Additional experiments showed that
DBS had no long-term influence on locomotor activity and spatial learning and
retention capabilities in Morris water maze tasks. Subsequent
immunohistochemistry measurements revealed that the behavioral consequences were 
associated with a significant increase in the expression of pCREB and a reduction
in the expression of <U+0394>FosB in the NAc.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the NAc DBS could be an effective and
safe therapeutic option for preventing relapse to heroin addiction.

PACAP-deficient mice show attenuated corticosterone secretion and fail to develop
depressive behavior during chronic social defeat stress.

The neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)
regulates activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the
adrenal gland in response to various stressors. We previously found that in
response to acute psychological stress (restraint), elevated
corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) mRNA levels in the hypothalamic
paraventricular nucleus (PVN) as well as elevated plasma corticosterone (CORT)
were profoundly attenuated in PACAP-deficient mice. To determine whether HPA axis
responses and stress-induced depressive-like behaviors in a chronic stress
paradigm are affected by PACAP deficiency, we subjected mice to 14 days of social
defeat stress. Defeat-exposed PACAP-/- mice showed a marked attenuation of
stress-induced increases in serum CORT levels, cellular PVN <U+0394>FosB immunostaining,
and depressive-like behaviors (social interaction and forced swim tests) compared
to wild-type control mice. The PACAP-/- mice showed reduced PVN FosB-positive
cell numbers, but relatively elevated cell counts in several forebrain areas
including the medial prefrontal cortex, after social stress. PACAP appears to be 
specific for mediating HPA activation only in psychological stress because marked
elevations in plasma CORT after a systemic stressor (lipopolysaccharide
administration) occurred regardless of genotype. We conclude that chronically
elevated CORT is a key component of depressive effects of social defeat, and that
attenuation of the CORT response at the level of the PVN, as well as
extrahypothalamic forebrain regions, in PACAP-deficient mice protects from
development of depressive behavior.

Bacillithiol (BSH) has been prepared on the gram scale from the inexpensive
starting material, D-glucosamine hydrochloride, in 11 steps and 8-9% overall
yield. The BSH was used to survey the substrate and metal-ion selectivity of FosB
enzymes from four Gram-positive microorganisms associated with the deactivation
of the antibiotic fosfomycin. The in vitro results indicate that the preferred
thiol substrate and metal ion for the FosB from Staphylococcus aureus are BSH and
Ni(II), respectively. However, the metal-ion selectivity is less distinct with
FosB from Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus anthracis, or Bacillus cereus.

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a moderately effective treatment for intractable
epilepsy. However, the mechanism of action is poorly understood. The effect of
left VNS in amygdala kindled rats was investigated by studying changes in nNOS
and <U+0394>Fos B expression in primary and secondary vagus nerve projection nuclei: the
nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve
(DMV), parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and locus coeruleus (LC). Rats were fully
kindled by stimulation of the amygdala. Subsequently, when the fully kindled
state was reached and then maintained for ten days, rats received a single 3-min 
train of VNS starting 1min prior to the kindling stimulus and lasting for 2min
afterwards. In control animals the vagus nerve was not stimulated. Animals were
sacrificed 48h later. The brainstems were stained for neuronal nitric oxide
synthase (nNOS) and <U+0394>Fos B. VNS decreased seizure duration with more than 25% in 
21% of rats. No VNS associated changes in nNOS immunoreactivity were observed in 
the NTS and no changes in <U+0394>Fos B were observed in the NTS, PBN, or LC. High nNOS 
immunopositive cell densities of >300cells/mm(2) were significantly more frequent
in the left DMV than in the right (<U+03C7>(2)(1)=26.2, p<0.01), independent of whether 
the vagus nerve was stimulated. We conclude that the observed nNOS
immunoreactivity in the DMV suggests surgery-induced axonal damage. A 3-min train
of VNS in fully kindled rats does not affect <U+0394>Fos B expression in primary and
secondary projection nuclei of the vagus nerve.

The interaction between environmental signals and genes has now taken on a clear 
molecular form as demonstrated by stable changes in chromatin structure. These
changes occur through activation or repression of specific gene programmes by a
combination of chromatin remodelling, activation and enzymatic modification of
DNA and histones as well as nucleosomal subunit exchange. Recent research
investigating the molecular mechanisms controlling drug-induced transcriptional, 
behavioural and synaptic activity has shown a direct role for chromatin
remodelling--termed as epigenetic regulation--of neuronal gene programmes and
subsequent addictive behaviour arising from it. Recent data suggest that repeated
exposure to certain drugs promotes changes in levels of histone acetylation,
phosphorylation and methylation, together with alterations in DNA methylation
levels in the neurons of the brain reward centre, localised in the Nucleus
Accumbens (NAc) region of the limbic system. The combination of acetylating,
phosphorylating and methylating H3 and H4 histone tails alter chromatin
compaction thereby promoting altered levels of cellular gene expression. Histone 
modifications, which weaken histone interaction with DNA or that promote
recruitment of transcriptional activating complexes, correlate with permissive
gene expression. Histone deacetylation, (which strengthen histone: DNA contacts),
or histone methylation, (which recruits repressive complexes to chromatin),
promote a state of transcriptional repression. Using animal models, acute cocaine
treatment increases H4 acetylation at acutely regulated gene promoters, whereas
H3 acetylation appears to predominate at chronically induced promoters. Chronic
cocaine and alcohol treatment activate and repress many genes such as FosB, Cdk5,
and Bdnf, where their dysregulation, at the chromatin level, contribute to the
development and maintenance of addiction. Following drug exposure, it is still
unknown, howver, how long these changes in chromatin structure persist in
affecting neuronal function, but some do so for life.

MR imaging of gene transcription is important as it should enable the
non-invasive detection of mRNA alterations in disease. A range of MRI methods
have been proposed for in vivo molecular imaging of cells based on the use of
ultra-small super-paramagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles and related
susceptibility weighted imaging methods. Although immunohistochemistry can
robustly differentiate the expression of protein variants, there is currently no 
direct gene assay technique that is capable of differentiating established to
differentiate the induction profiles of c-Fos mRNA in vivo. To visualize the
differential FosB gene expression profile in vivo after burn trauma, we developed
MR probes that link the T2* contrast agent [superparamagnetic iron oxide
nanoparticles (SPION)] with an oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) sequence complementary 
to FosB mRNA to visualize endogenous mRNA targets via in vivo hybridization. The 
presence of this SPION-ODN probe in cells results in localized signal reduction
in T2*-weighted MR images, in which the rate of signal reduction (R2*) reflects
the regional iron concentration at different stages of amphetamine (AMPH)
exposure in living mouse tissue. Our aim was to produce a superior contrast agent
that can be administered using systemic as opposed to local administration and
which will target and accumulate at sites of burn injury. Specifically, we
developed and evaluated a PEGylated lipid coated MR probe with ultra-small
super-paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (USPION, a T2 susceptibility agent)
coated with cationic fusogenic lipids, used for cell transfection and gene
delivery and covalently linked to a phosphorothioate modified
oligodeoxynucleotide (sODN) complementary to c-Fos mRNA (SPION-cFos) and used the
agent to image mice with leg burns. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of
monitoring burn injury using MR imaging of c-Fos transcription in vivo, in a
clinically relevant mouse model of burn injury for the first time.

Direct chromatin PCR (DC-PCR): hypotonic conditions allow differentiation of
chromatin states during thermal cycling.

Institute, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of

Current methods to study chromatin configuration are not well suited for high
throughput drug screening since they require large cell numbers and multiple
experimental steps that include centrifugation for isolation of nuclei or DNA.
Here we show that site specific chromatin analysis can be achieved in one step by
simply performing direct chromatin PCR (DC-PCR) on cells. The basic underlying
observation was that standard hypotonic PCR buffers prevent global cellular
chromatin solubilization during thermal cycling while more loosely organized
chromatin can be amplified. Despite repeated heating to >90 °C, 41 of 61 tested
5' sequences of silenced genes (CDKN2A, PU.1, IRF4, FOSB, CD34) were not
amplifiable while 47 could be amplified from expressing cells. Two gene regions
(IRF4, FOSB) even required pre-heating of cells in isotonic media to allow this
differentiation; otherwise none of 19 assayed sequences yielded PCR products.
Cells with baseline expression or epigenetic reactivation gave similar DC-PCR
results. Silencing during differentiation of CD34 positive cord blood cells
closed respective chromatin while treatment of myeloma cells with an IRF4
transcriptional inhibitor opened a site to DC-PCR that was occupied by RNA
polymerase II and NF<U+03BA>B as determined by ChIP. Translation into real-time PCR can 
not be achieved with commercial real-time PCR buffers which potently open
chromatin, but even with simple ethidium bromide addition to standard PCR
mastermix we were able to identify hits in small molecules screens that
suppressed IRF4 expression or reactivated CDKN2A in myeloma cells using
densitometry or visual inspection of PCR plates under UV light. While need in
drug development inspired this work, application to genome-wide analysis appears 
feasible using phi29 for selective amplification of open cellular chromatin
followed by library construction from supernatants since such supernatants
yielded similar results as gene specific DC-PCR.

Pharmacological or genetic blockade of the dopamine D3 receptor increases cell
proliferation in the hippocampus of adult mice.

Dopamine plays an important role in cellular processes controlling the functional
and structural plasticity of neurons, as well as their generation and
proliferation, both in the developing and the adult brain. The precise roles of
individual dopamine receptors subtypes in adult neurogenesis remain poorly
defined, although D3 receptors are known to be involved in neurogenesis in the
subventricular zone. By contrast, very few studies have addressed the influence
of dopamine and D3 receptors upon neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the
hippocampus, an issue addressed herein employing constitutive D3 receptor
knockout mice, or chronic exposure to the preferential D3 receptor antagonist,
S33138. D3 receptor knockout mice revealed increased baseline levels of cell
proliferation and ongoing neurogenesis, as measured both using Ki-67 and
doublecortin, whereas there was no difference in cell survival as measured by
BrdU (5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine). Chronic administration of S33138 was shown to be 
functionally active in enhancing levels of the plasticity-related molecule,
delta-FosB, in the D3 receptor-rich nucleus accumbens. In accordance with the
stimulated neurogenesis seen in D3 receptor knockout mice, S33138 increased
proliferation in wild-type mice. These observations suggest that D3 receptors
exert a tonic, constitutive inhibitory influence upon adult hippocampal
neurogenesis.

Hypothalamic expression of Peg3 gene is associated with maternal care differences
between SM/J and LG/J mouse strains.

Chiavegatto S, Sauce B, Ambar G, Cheverud JM, Peripato AC.

Maternal care is essential in mammals, and variations in the environment provided
by mothers may directly influence the viability of newborns and emotional
behavior later in life. A previous study investigated genetic variations
associated with maternal care in an intercross of LG/J and SM/J inbred mouse
strains and identified two single-locus QTLs (quantitative trait loci). Here, we 
selected three candidate genes located within these QTLs intervals; Oxt on
chromosome 2, and FosB and Peg3 on chromosome 7 and tested their association with
maternal care. LG/J females showed impaired postpartum nest building and pup
retrieval, a one-day delay in milk ejection, reduced exploratory activity, and
higher anxiety-like behavior when compared to SM/J females. The nucleotide
sequences of Oxt and FosB were similar between strains, as were their
hypothalamic expression levels. Conversely, Peg3 nucleotide sequences showed four
nonsynonymous replacement substitutions on LG/J dams, T11062G, G13744A, A13808G, 
and G13813A, and a 30 base pair (10 aa) in tandem repeat in the coding region
with three copies in SM/J and five copies in LG/J. Maternal care impaired LG/J
mothers express 37% lower Peg3 mRNA levels in the hypothalamus on the second
postpartum day. We also found an association of the Peg3 repeat-variant and poor 
maternal care in F(2) heterozygote females derived from a LG/J × SM/J intercross.
These results may suggest that the maternally imprinted Peg3 gene is responsible 
for the single-locus QTL on chromosome 7 that has been shown to influence
maternal care in these strains. Furthermore, these data provide additional
support for an epigenetic regulation of maternal behavior.

Striatal D2 and D3 dopamine receptors are involved in mediating the reinforcing
properties of natural rewards and drugs. In Parkinson's disease, while D2/3
dopamine agonists alleviate motor symptoms, behavioral addictions and withdrawal 
syndrome are reported in up to 15% of patients. The origin of such adverse
effects is poorly understood but suggests that D2/3 agonists could possess
reinforcing properties. We evaluated the reinforcing properties of the widely
used D2/3 agonist, Pramipexole (PPX), in normal and parkinsonian rats.
Intracerebroventricular injections of 6-OHDA induced a bilateral loss of tyrosine
hydroxylase-positive cells in the substantia nigra (-51%) and ventral tegmental
area (-31%). The animals were then allowed to self-administer intravenous PPX
under fixed ratio and progressive ratio (PR) reinforcement schedules before being
tested for extinction of PPX seeking. While parkinsonian were slower than sham
rats in acquiring self-administration behavior, they later reached the same level
of intake. The reinforcing value of PPX, as assessed during PR and extinction,
was moderate in both groups. PPX heightened <U+2206>FosB expression in dorsal striatum
of lesioned rats and similar PR results involved different striatal subregions
between groups. Altogether, our results show that drug-naïve rats self-administer
PPX and that the dopaminergic lesion does not affect its reinforcing effects.
While PPX reinforcing value was moderate in most rats, a subset of animals
displayed a high number of responses and appeared to be particularly sensitive to
this drug. These data suggest that PPX may not be responsible for the reported
side-effects but rather call for further investigating the differential
vulnerability among individuals.

Brain regional differences in CB1 receptor adaptation and regulation of
transcription.

Studies, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.

Cannabinoid CB1 receptors (CB1Rs) are expressed throughout the brain and mediate 
the central effects of cannabinoids, including <U+0394>(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),
the main psychoactive constituent of marijuana. Repeated THC administration
produces tolerance to cannabinoid-mediated effects, although the magnitude of
tolerance varies by effect. Consistent with this observation, CB1R
desensitization and downregulation, as well as induction of immediate early genes
(IEGs), vary by brain region. Zif268 and c-Fos are induced in the forebrain after
acute THC administration. Phosphorylation of the cAMP response-element binding
protein (CREB) is increased in a region-specific manner after THC administration.
Results differ between acute versus repeated THC injection, and suggest that
tolerance to IEG activation might develop in some regions. Repeated THC treatment
produces CB1R desensitization and downregulation in the brain, although less
adaption occurs in the striatum as compared to regions such as the hippocampus.
Repeated THC treatment also induces expression of <U+0394>FosB, a very stable isoform of
FosB, in the striatum. Transgenic expression of <U+2206>FosB in the striatum enhances
the rewarding effects of several drugs, but its role in THC-mediated effects is
not known. The inverse regional relationship between CB1R desensitization and
<U+2206>FosB induction suggests that these adaptations might inhibit each other,
although this possibility has not been investigated. The differential regional
expression of individual IEGs by acute or repeated THC administration suggests
that regulation of target genes and effects on CB1R signaling will contribute to 
the behavioral effects of THC.

From cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma in HCV-infected patients: genes
involved in tumor progression.

Wang Y(1), Li J, Chen J, Liu L, Peng Z, Ding J, Ding K.

Author information:

China.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive tumor with poor
prognosis. Understanding molecular changes in hepatocellular carcinoma should
improve identification of risk factors in molecular subtypes and provide
potential targets for early detection and therapy.
AIM: The present study aimed to analyze the molecular mechanism of the transition
from hepatitis C virus (HCV) induced cirrhosis to HCV induced HCC using
microarray analysis combined with bioinformatics techniques. METHODS, To
accomplish this, we performed the differential coexpression analysis of hepatic
gene expression in samples of HCV-cirrhotic patients with and without HCC. Total 
465 genes were identified and some of them were used to construct a regulatory
network.
RESULTS: Our analysis indicated that several differentially co-express genes
might play crucial roles in HCC development, including NA3C2, AHR, MYC, FOXO1 and
FOSB. Further analysis predicted these genes might be involved in HCC through
pathways of "ribosome", "steroid biosynthesis", "spliceosome" and so on.
Moreover, these genes may serve as potential therapeutic targets for the
treatment of HCC.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our findings confirm the presence of multiple
molecular alterations during HCV-infected HCC hepatocarcinogenesis and indicate
the possibility for identifying prognostic factors associated with HCC
progression.

Prevalence of acquired fosfomycin resistance among extended-spectrum
ß-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical
isolates in Korea and IS26-composite transposon surrounding fosA3.

Korea, Seoul, Korea.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of plasmid-mediated fosfomycin
resistance determinants among extended-spectrum ß-lactamase (ESBL)-producing
Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and their genetic environments.
METHODS: A total of 347 non-duplicate ESBL-producing E. coli (165) and K.
pneumoniae (182) were collected. The fosfomycin MICs were determined by the agar 
dilution method according to CLSI guidelines. PCR was used to detect the
plasmid-encoded fosfomycin resistance genes (fosA, fosA3, fosB and fosC2). For
isolates harbouring plasmid-encoded fosfomycin resistance genes, sequence types
(STs) were determined. The transformation experiment was performed using E. coli 
TOPO10 (Invitrogen, USA) as a recipient strain. With the plasmids from the
transformants, plasmid replicon typing was performed and the nucleotide sequences
adjacent to fosA3 were determined.
RESULTS: The susceptibility to fosfomycin was 92.9% in E. coli and 95.2% in K.
pneumoniae. Of the 21 isolates non-susceptible to fosfomycin (8 E. coli and 13 K.
pneumoniae), 7 (5 E. coli and 2 K. pneumoniae) isolates harboured fosA3 and all
of them co-harboured bla(CTX-M-1group) or bla(CTX-M-9group). The STs of the
isolates harbouring fosA3 were diverse (E. coli: ST1, ST1, ST533, ST2 and ST86;
K. pneumoniae: ST11 and ST101). The plasmid replicon types of transformants
co-harbouring bla(CTX-M-1group) and bla(CTX-M-9group) were IncF and IncN,
respectively. By sequence analysis, we found the common feature that the fosA3
gene, connected to bla(CTX-M) via insertion sequences, was located between two
IS26 elements oriented in the opposite direction, composing an IS26-composite
transposon.
CONCLUSIONS: An IS26-composite transposon appears to be the main vehicle for
dissemination of fosA3 in E. coli and K. pneumoniae of diverse clones.

Small molecule screening identifies regulators of the transcription factor <U+0394>FosB.

<U+0394>FosB protein accumulates in the striatum in response to chronic administration
of drugs of abuse, L-DOPA, or stress, triggering long lasting neural and
behavioral changes that underlie aspects of drug addiction, abnormal involuntary 
movements (dyskinesia), and depression. <U+0394>FosB binds AP-1 DNA consensus sequences 
found in promoters of many genes and can both repress or activate gene
transcription. In the striatum, <U+0394>FosB is thought to dimerize with JunD to form a 
functional transcription factor, though strikingly JunD does not accumulate in
parallel. One explanation is that <U+0394>FosB can recruit different partners, including
itself, depending on the neuron type in which it is induced and the chronic
stimulus, generating protein complexes with different effects on gene
transcription. To develop chemical probes to study <U+0394>FosB, a high-throughput
screen was carried out to identify small molecules that modulate <U+0394>FosB function. 
Two compounds with low micromolar activity, termed C2 and C6, disrupt the binding
of <U+0394>FosB to DNA via different mechanisms, and in in vitro assays stimulate
<U+0394>FosB-mediated transcription. In cocaine-treated mice, C2 significantly elevates 
mRNA levels of the AMPA glutamate receptor GluR2 subunit with specificity, a
known target gene of <U+0394>FosB that plays a role in drug addiction and endogenous
resilience mechanisms. C2 and C6 show different activities against <U+0394>FosB
homodimers compared to <U+0394>FosB/JunD heterodimers, suggesting that these compounds
can be used as probes to study the contribution of different <U+0394>FosB-containing
complexes on the regulation of gene transcription in biological systems and to
assess the utility of <U+0394>FosB as a therapeutic target.

accumbens.

<U+0394>FosB, a Fosb gene product, is induced in nucleus accumbens (NAc) and
caudate-putamen (CPu) by repeated exposure to drugs of abuse such as cocaine.
This induction contributes to aberrant patterns of gene expression and behavioral
abnormalities seen with repeated drug exposure. Here, we assessed whether a
remote history of cocaine exposure in rats might alter inducibility of the Fosb
gene elicited by subsequent drug exposure. We show that prior chronic cocaine
administration, followed by extended withdrawal, increases inducibility of Fosb
in NAc, as evidenced by greater acute induction of <U+0394>FosB mRNA and faster
accumulation of <U+0394>FosB protein after repeated cocaine reexposure. No such primed
Fosb induction was observed in CPu; in fact, subsequent acute induction of <U+0394>FosB 
mRNA was suppressed in CPu. These abnormal patterns of Fosb expression are
associated with chromatin modifications at the Fosb gene promoter. Prior chronic 
cocaine administration induces a long-lasting increase in RNA polymerase II (Pol 
II) binding at the Fosb promoter in NAc only, suggesting that Pol II "stalling"
primes Fosb for induction in this region upon reexposure to cocaine. A cocaine
challenge then triggers the release of Pol II from the gene promoter, allowing
for more rapid Fosb transcription. A cocaine challenge also decreases repressive 
histone modifications at the Fosb promoter in NAc, but increases such repressive 
marks and decreases activating marks in CPu. These results provide new insight
into the chromatin dynamics at the Fosb promoter and reveal a novel mechanism for
primed Fosb induction in NAc upon reexposure to cocaine.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac interstitial fibrosis is a major cause of the deteriorated
performance of the heart in patients with chronic myocardial infarction.
MicroRNAs (miRs) have recently been proven to be a novel class of regulators of
cardiovascular diseases, including those associated with cardiac fibrosis. This
study aimed to explore the role of miR-101 in cardiac fibrosis and the underlying
mechanisms.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Four weeks after coronary artery ligation of rats, the
expression of miR-101a and miR-101b (miR-101a/b) in the peri-infarct area was
decreased. Treatment of cultured rat neonatal cardiac fibroblasts with
angiotensin II also suppressed the expression of miR-101a/b. Forced expression of
miR-101a/b suppressed the proliferation and collagen production in rat neonatal
cardiac fibroblasts, as revealed by cell counting, MTT assay, and quantitative
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The effect was abrogated by
cotransfection with AMO-101a/b, the antisense inhibitors of miR-101a/b. c-Fos was
found to be a target of miR-101a because overexpression of miR-101a decreased the
protein and mRNA levels of c-Fos and its downstream protein transforming growth
factor-ß1. Silencing c-Fos by siRNA mimicked the antifibrotic action of miR-101a,
whereas forced expression of c-Fos protein canceled the effect of miR-101a in
cultured cardiac fibroblasts. Strikingly, echocardiography and hemodynamic
measurements indicated remarkable improvement of the cardiac performance 4 weeks 
after adenovirus-mediated overexpression of miR-101a in rats with chronic
myocardial infarction. Furthermore, the interstitial fibrosis was alleviated and 
the expression of c-Fos and transforming growth factor-ß1 was inhibited.
CONCLUSION: Overexpression of miR-101a can mitigate interstitial fibrosis and the
deterioration of cardiac performance in postinfarct rats, indicating the
therapeutic potential of miR-101a for cardiac disease associated with fibrosis.

OBJECTIVES: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), a dilatation of the infrarenal
aorta, typically affects males >65 years. The pathobiological mechanisms of human
AAA are poorly understood. The goal of this study was to identify novel pathways 
involved in the development of AAAs.
METHODS: A custom-designed 'AAA-chip' was used to assay 43 of the differentially 
expressed genes identified in a previously published microarray study between AAA
(n = 15) and control (n = 15) infrarenal abdominal aorta. Protein analyses were
performed on selected genes.
RESULTS: Altogether 38 of the 43 genes on the 'AAA-chip' showed significantly
different expression. Novel validated genes in AAA pathobiology included ADCY7,
ARL4C, BLNK, FOSB, GATM, LYZ, MFGE8, PRUNE2, PTPRC, SMTN, TMODI and TPM2. These
genes represent a wide range of biological functions, such as calcium signaling, 
development and differentiation, as well as cell adhesion not previously
implicated in AAA pathobiology. Protein analyses for GATM, CD4, CXCR4, BLNK,
PLEK, LYZ, FOSB, DUSP6, ITGA5 and PTPRC confirmed the mRNA findings.
CONCLUSION: The results provide new directions for future research into AAA
pathogenesis to study the role of novel genes confirmed here. New treatments and 
diagnostic tools for AAA could potentially be identified by studying these novel 
pathways.

Electroacupuncture decreases excessive alcohol consumption involving reduction of
FosB/<U+0394>FosB levels in reward-related brain regions.

Li J(1), Sun Y, Ye JH.

Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New
Jersey, United States of America.

New therapies are needed for alcohol abuse, a major public health problem in the 
U.S. and worldwide. There are only three FDA-approved drugs for treatment of
alcohol abuse (naltrexone, acamprosate and disulfuram). On average these drugs
yield only moderate success in reducing long-term alcohol consumption.
Electroacupuncture has been shown to alleviate various drugs of abuse, including 
alcohol. Although previous studies have shown that electroacupuncture reduced
alcohol consumption, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated.
<U+0394>FosB and FosB are members of the Fos family of transcription factors implicated 
in neural plasticity in drug addiction; a connection between electroacupuncture's
treatment of alcohol abuse and the Fos family has not been established. In this
study, we trained rats to drink large quantities of ethanol in a modified
intermittent access two-bottle choice drinking procedure. When rats achieved a
stable baseline of ethanol consumption, electroacupuncture (100 Hz or 2 Hz, 30
min each day) was administered at Zusanli (ST36) for 6 consecutive days. The
level of FosB/<U+0394>FosB in reward-related brain regions was assessed by
immunohistochemistry. We found that the intake of and preference for ethanol in
rats under 100 Hz, but not 2 Hz electroacupuncture regiment were sharply reduced.
The reduction was maintained for at least 72 hours after the termination of
electroacupuncture treatment. Conversely, 100 Hz electroacupuncture did not alter
the intake of and preference for the natural rewarding agent sucrose.
Additionally, FosB/<U+0394>FosB levels in the prefrontal cortex, striatal region and the
posterior region of ventral tegmental area were increased following excessive
ethanol consumption, but were reduced after six-day 100 Hz electroacupuncture.
Thus, this study demonstrates that six-day 100 Hz electroacupuncture treatment
effectively reduces ethanol consumption and preference in rats that chronically
drink excessive amount of ethanol. This effect of electroacupuncture may be
mediated by down-regulation of FosB/<U+0394>FosB in reward-related brain regions.

Chronic stress induces presynaptic and postsynaptic modifications in the
paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus that are consistent with enhanced
excitatory hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis drive. The brain
regions mediating these molecular modifications are not known. We hypothesized
that chronic variable stress (CVS) tonically activates stress-excitatory regions 
that interact with the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, culminating
in stress facilitation. In order to identify chronically activated brain regions,
<U+0394>FosB, a documented marker of tonic neuronal activation, was assessed in known
stress regulatory limbic and brainstem sites. Four experimental groups were
included: CVS, repeated restraint (RR) (control for HPA habituation), animals
weight-matched (WM) to CVS animals (control for changes in circulating metabolic 
factors due to reduced weight gain), and non-handled controls. CVS, (but not RR
or WM) induced adrenal hypertrophy, indicating that sustained HPA axis drive only
occurred in the CVS group. CVS (but not RR or WM) selectively increased the
number of FosB/<U+0394>FosB nuclei in the nucleus of the solitary tract, posterior
hypothalamic nucleus, and both the infralimbic and prelimbic divisions of the
medial prefrontal cortex, indicating an involvement of these regions in chronic
drive of the HPA axis. Increases in FosB/<U+0394>FosB-immunoreactive cells were observed
following both RR and CVS in the other regions (e.g. the dorsomedial
hypothalamus), suggesting activation by both habituating and non-habituating
stress conditions. The data suggest that unpredictable stress uniquely activates 
interconnected cortical, hypothalamic, and brainstem nuclei, potentially
revealing the existence of a recruited circuitry mediating chronic drive of brain
stress effector systems.

The aim of the study was to assess the activity of AP-1 family proteins, e.g.
Fra-1, Fra-2, JunB, JunD, and FosB, engaged in the regulation of inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and the production of NO by neutrophils (PMN)
exposed to N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) xenobiotic. Isolated human PMN were
incubated in the presence of NDMA. iNOS mRNA expression was then analyzed using
Northern blot and the expression of other proteins in the cytoplasmic and nuclear
fractions were assessed using Western blot. The obtained results indicate that
NDMA increased iNOS mRNA and protein expression in human PMN. Furthermore, it
increased the expression of Fra-1, Fra-2, JunB, and JunD in the cytoplasmic
fraction, and FosB expression in the fractions of analyzed cells. As a
consequence of inhibiting p38 pathway and JNK, reduced iNOS expression and NO
production was noted in PMN exposed to NDMA. Inhibition of the p38 pathway
resulted in reduced expression of all analyzed proteins in the cytoplasmic
fraction of PMN exposed to NDMA. Furthermore, increased Fra-2 expression and
reduced FosB expression were found in the nuclear fraction of those cells.
Inhibiting ERK5 pathway resulted in increased JunB expression in both fractions
of the analyzed cells. Therefore, no changes in the expression of analyzed
proteins in the presence of NDMA were observed in PMN pre-incubated with JNK
pathway inhibitor. In conclusion, the results here indicate a role of Fra-1,
Fra-2, JunB, JunD, and FosB transcription factors in the regulation of iNOS
expression and NO production by human neutrophils exposed to NDMA.

Exercise training normalizes enhanced sympathetic activation from the
paraventricular nucleus in chronic heart failure: role of angiotensin II.

Author information:

Medical Center, Omaha, 68198-5850, USA.

Exercise training (ExT) normalizes the increased sympathetic outflow in heart
failure (HF), but the underlying mechanisms are not known. We hypothesized ExT
would normalize the augmented activation of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) via
an angiotensinergic mechanism during HF. Four groups of rats used were the
following: 1) sham-sedentary (Sed); 2) sham-ExT; 3) HF-Sed, and 4) HF-ExT. HF was
induced by left coronary artery ligation. Four weeks after surgery, 3 wk of
treadmill running was performed in ExT groups. The number of FosB-positive cells 
in the PVN was significantly increased in HF-Sed group compared with the sham-Sed
group. ExT normalized (negated) this increase in the rats with HF. In
anesthetized condition, the increases in renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA),
mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) in response to microinjection
of angiotensin (ANG) II (50~200 pmol) in the PVN of HF-Sed group were
significantly greater than of the sham-Sed group. In the HF-ExT group the
responses to microinjection of ANG II were not different from sham-Sed or
sham-ExT groups. Blockade of ANG II type 1 (AT(1)) receptors with losartan in the
PVN produced a significantly greater decrease in RSNA, MAP, and HR in HF-Sed
group compared with sham-Sed group. ExT prevented the difference between HF and
sham groups. AT(1) receptor protein expression was increased 50% in HF-Sed group 
compared with sham-Sed group. In the HF-ExT group, AT(1) receptor protein
expression was not significantly different from sham-Sed or sham-ExT groups. In
conclusion, one mechanism by which ExT alleviates elevated sympathetic outflow in
HF may be through normalization of angiotensinergic mechanisms within the PVN.

Recently developed methods for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of
freshly-isolated brain cells from transgenic mice combining fluorescent signals
with cell type-specific markers allow cell-type separation. Based upon previous
observations in primary cultures of mouse astrocytes we treated transgenic mice
tagged with a neuron-specific or an astrocyte-specific marker with fluoxetine,
either acute (10 mg/kg for 2 h) or chronic (10 mg/kg daily for 2 weeks). Acute
treatment upregulated cfos and fosB mRNA expression in astrocytes and neurons.
Chronic effects on astrocytes replicated those demonstrated in cultures, i.e.,
upregulation of mRNA and/or protein expression of 5-HT(2B) receptors (5-HT(2B)R),
and GluK2 receptors, and of cPLA(2a) and ADAR2, together with increased GluK2 and
5-HT(2B)R editing. Neurons showed increased GluK4 and 5-HT(2C) receptor
expression. To further correlate these findings with major depression we compared
the changes in gene expression with those in a mouse model of anhedonia. Three
out of 4 genes up-regulated in astrocytes by fluoxetine were down-regulated,
whereas the neuronally upregulated 5-HT(2C) receptor gene showed no change.
References are made to recent review papers discussing potential relations
between observed fluoxetine effects and clinical effects of SSRIs, emphasizing
that all 5 clinically used SSRIs have identical and virtually equipotent effects 
on cultured astrocytes.

One of the main clinical features of obstructive sleep apnea is sustained
hypertension and elevated sympathetic activity during waking hours. Chronic
intermittent hypoxia (CIH), animal model of the hypoxemia associated with
obstructive sleep apnea, produces a similar sustained increase in blood pressure.
This study determined the role of <U+0394>FosB in the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) in 
the sustained increase in mean arterial pressure associated with CIH. Rats were
injected in the MnPO with viral vectors that expressed green fluorescent protein 
alone or green fluorescent protein plus a dominant-negative construct that
inhibits the transcriptional effects of <U+0394>FosB. In green fluorescent
protein-injected rats and uninjected controls, 7-day exposure to CIH increased
mean arterial pressure by 7 to 10 mm Hg during both intermittent hypoxia exposure
and normoxia. Dominant-negative inhibition of MnPO <U+0394>FosB did not affect changes
in mean arterial pressure during intermittent hypoxia exposure but significantly 
reduced the sustained component of the blood pressure response to CIH during the 
normoxic dark phase. Inhibition of MnPO <U+0394>FosB reduced the FosB/<U+0394>FosB staining in 
the paraventricular nucleus and rostral ventrolateral medulla but not the nucleus
of the solitary tract. PCR array analysis identified 6 activator protein
1-regulated genes expressed in the MnPO that were increased by CIH exposure, ace,
ace2, nos1, nos3, prdx2, and map3k3. Dominant-negative inhibition of <U+0394>FosB in the
MnPO blocked increased expression of each of these genes in rats exposed to CIH
except for Prdx2. <U+0394>FosB may mediate transcriptional activity in MnPO necessary
for sustained CIH hypertension, suggesting that neural adaptations may contribute
to diurnal hypertension in obstructive sleep apnea.

Serum response factor and cAMP response element binding protein are both required
for cocaine induction of <U+0394>FosB.

The molecular mechanism underlying induction by cocaine of <U+0394>FosB, a transcription
factor important for addiction, remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate a necessary
role for two transcription factors, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) 
and serum response factor (SRF), in mediating this induction within the mouse
nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward region. CREB and SRF are both
activated in NAc by cocaine and bind to the fosB gene promoter. Using
viral-mediated Cre recombinase expression in the NAc of single- or double-floxed 
mice, we show that deletion of both transcription factors from this brain region 
completely blocks cocaine induction of <U+0394>FosB in NAc, whereas deletion of either
factor alone has no effect. Furthermore, deletion of both SRF and CREB from NAc
renders animals less sensitive to the rewarding effects of moderate doses of
cocaine when tested in the conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure and also 
blocks locomotor sensitization to higher doses of cocaine. Deletion of CREB alone
has the opposite effect and enhances both cocaine CPP and locomotor
sensitization. In contrast to <U+0394>FosB induction by cocaine, <U+0394>FosB induction in NAc 
by chronic social stress, which we have shown previously requires activation of
SRF, is unaffected by the deletion of CREB alone. These surprising findings
demonstrate the involvement of distinct transcriptional mechanisms in mediating
<U+0394>FosB induction within this same brain region by cocaine versus stress. Our
results also establish a complex mode of regulation of <U+0394>FosB induction in
response to cocaine, which requires the concerted activities of both SRF and
CREB.

Bile duct ligation (BDL), a model of hepatic cirrhosis, is associated with
dilutional hyponatremia and inappropriate vasopressin release. <U+0394>FosB staining was
significantly increased in vasopressin and oxytocin magnocellular neurosecretory 
cells in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) of BDL rats. We tested the role of SON
<U+0394>FosB in fluid retention following BDL by injecting the SON (n = 10) with 400 nl 
of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing <U+0394>JunD (a dominant negative
construct for <U+0394>FosB) plus green fluorescent protein (GFP) (AAV-GFP-<U+0394>JunD).
Controls were either noninjected or injected with an AAV vector expressing only
GFP. Three weeks after BDL or sham ligation surgery, rats were individually
housed in metabolism cages for 1 wk. Average daily water intake was significantly
elevated in all BDL rats compared with sham ligated controls. Average daily urine
output was significantly greater in AAV-GFP-<U+0394>JunD-treated BDL rats compared with 
all other groups. Daily average urine sodium concentration was significantly
lower in AAV-GFP-<U+0394>JunD-treated BDL rats than the other groups, although average
daily sodium excretion was not different among the groups. SON expression of
<U+0394>JunD produced a diuresis in BDL rats that may be related to decreased
circulating levels of vasopressin or oxytocin. These findings support the view
that <U+0394>FosB expression in SON magnocellular secretory cells contribute to
dilutional hyponatremia in BDL rats.

Controlled-release levodopa methyl ester/benserazide-loaded nanoparticles
ameliorate levodopa-induced dyskinesia in rats.

University School of Medicine), Shanghai, People's Republic of China.

BACKGROUND: Levodopa remains the most effective drug in the treatment of
Parkinson's disease. However, long-term administration of levodopa induces motor 
complications, such as levodopa-induced dyskinesia. The mechanisms underlying
levodopa-induced dyskinesia are not fully understood.
METHODS: In this study, we prepared levodopa methyl ester
(LDME)/benserazide-loaded nanoparticles, which can release LDME and benserazide
in a sustained manner. Dyskinesia was induced in rats by repeated administration 
of levodopa then treated with LDME plus benserazide or the same dose of
LDME/benserazide-loaded nanoparticles. Apomorphine- induced rotations and
abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) were measured on treatment days 1, 5, 10,
15, and 20. In addition, the levels of phosphorylated dopamine- and cyclic
adenosine monophosphate- regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa, extracellular
signal-regulated kinases 1/2, and <U+0394>fosB were determined by Western blot. Tau
levels were determined by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Dynorphin levels
in the striatum and cortex of rats were measured using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Over the course of levodopa treatment, the rats developed abnormal AIMs,
classified as locomotive, axial, orolingual, and forelimb dyskinesia. The degree 
of reduction of apomorphine-induced rotations was comparable in dyskinetic rats
treated with LDME plus benserazide or LDME/benserazide-loaded nanoparticles. The 
axial, limb, and orolingual (ALO) AIMs of dyskinetic rats treated with
LDME/benserazide-loaded nanoparticles were 14 ± 2.5, 9 ± 2.0, and 10 ± 2.1 on
treatment days 10, 15, and 20, respectively, which were significantly reduced
compared with dyskinetic rats treated with LDME plus benserazide (25 ± 3.7, 27 ± 
3.8, and 25 ± 3.5, respectively). The locomotive AIMs of dyskinetic rats treated 
with LDME/benserazide-loaded nanoparticles were 2.3 ± 0.42, 1.7 ± 0.35, and 1.6 ±
0.37 on treatment days 10, 15, and 20, respectively, which were also reduced
compared with dyskinetic rats treated with LDME plus benserazide (4.4 ± 0.85, 4.7
± 0.95 and 4.8 ± 0.37, respectively). Western blot showed that the levels of
phosphorylated dopamine- and cyclic adenosine monophosphate-regulated
phosphoprotein of 32 kDa, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2, tau, and
<U+0394>fosB in dyskinetic rats treated with LDME/benserazide-loaded nanoparticles were 
134.6 ± 14.1, 174.9 ± 15.1, 134.2 ± 19.3, and 320.5 ± 32.8, respectively, which
were significantly reduced compared with those of dyskinetic rats treated with
LDME plus benserazide (210.3 ± 19.7, 320.8 ± 21.9, 340.4 ± 27.1, and 620.7 ±
48.3, respectively). Immunohistochemistry indicated that the level of
phosphorylated tau was (7.2 ± 1.1) × 10(4) in dyskinetic rats treated with
LDME/benserazide-loaded nanoparticles. However, the tau level was only (14.6 ±
2.3) × 10(4) in LDME plus benserazide-treated dyskinetic rats. There was a
significant difference between the two groups. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
showed that dynorphin levels in the striatum and cortex of dyskinetic rats
treated with LDME/benserazide-loaded nanoparticles were 5.7 ± 1.2 and 4.8 ± 0.87,
respectively, which were significantly reduced compared with LDME plus
benserazide-treated dyskinetic rats (13.3 ± 2.1 and 8.1 ± 1.1 for the striatum
and cortex, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Results suggest that LDME/benserazide-loaded nanoparticles can be
used to reduce the expression of dyskinesia in dyskinetic rats.

The chloroethylating anticancer drug ACNU induces FRA1 that is involved in drug
resistance of glioma cells.

FRA1 belongs, together with c-Fos and FosB, to the family of Fos proteins that
form with members of the ATF and Jun family the transcription factor AP-1
(activator protein 1). Previously we showed that c-Fos protects mouse embryonic
fibroblasts against the cytotoxic effects of ultraviolet (UV) light by induction 
of the endonuclease XPF, leading to enhanced nucleotide excision repair (NER)
activity. Here, we analyzed the regulation of FRA1 in glioma cells treated with
the anticancer drug nimustine (ACNU) and its role in ACNU-induced toxicity. We
show that FRA1 is upregulated in glioblastoma cells following ACNU on mRNA and
protein levels. Knockdown of FRA1 by either siRNA or shRNA clearly sensitized
glioma cells towards ACNU-induced cell death. Despite decreased AP-1 binding
activity upon FRA1 knockdown, this effect is independent on regulation of the
AP-1 target genes fasL, ercc1 and xpf. In addition, FRA1 knockdown does not
affect DNA repair capacity. However, lack of FRA1 attenuated the ACNU-induced
phosphorylation of CHK1 and led to a reduced arrest of cells in G2/M and,
thereby, presumably leads to enhanced cell death in the subsequent cell cycle.

Animals attain information about their environment through different sense
organs. For example, the dominant external resource about the environment for
rodents is obtained through olfaction. Many environmental conditions (stress or
enriched environment) are known to affect an animal's susceptibility to drug
addiction. However, it is not known how external information is integrated and
paired with drug stimuli to develop into addictive behavior. Here, we
investigated the effects of olfactory epithelium lesions induced with ZnSO4
effusion (ZnE) on morphine-induced sensitization and conditioned place preference
in mice. We found that the lesion of the olfactory epithelium attenuated the
repeated morphine (40 mg/kg)-induced behavioral sensitization and
morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) behaviors, such as
hyper-locomotion during morphine (40 mg/kg) conditioned training. Additionally,
the expression of FosB-like proteins, transcription factors associated with
behavioral alterations, in the nucleus accumbens of the brain was attenuated in
morphine administered mice treated by ZnE. Taken together, these results
indicated that lesion of the olfactory epithelium lead to a decrease in morphine 
sensitization and CPP behavior in mice as well as modulate specific molecular
markers of neuroadaption to drugs of abuse. These findings also suggest that
olfaction plays an important role in the development of addictive behaviors that 
can be modulated by external actions.

pilot study.

BACKGROUND: Portal vein embolization is a treatment option to achieve a
sufficient future remnant liver volume for patients with central liver tumours
requiring an extended resection with an extensive parenchymal loss. However,
molecular mechanisms of this intervention are up to now poorly understood. The
objective of this prospective pilot study was the characterization of molecular
events leading to late hypertrophy of the non-embolized liver tissue in the human
liver.
METHODS: Liver tissue of ten patients was collected before and intraoperatively
more than one month after embolization. Investigation of molecular features was
performed by pangenomic chips, polymerase chain reaction, immunostaining of
proliferation marker Ki-67 and immunofluorescence measurements.
RESULTS: Significantly elevated genes hint towards angiogenesis and signalling by
insulin-like growth factor and associated binding proteins. Increased transcript 
levels of activator protein 1 complex members like c-jun were reflecting
potential molecular events of liver growth after embolization. Immunofluorescence
data confirmed a predominant upregulation of ß-catenin and c-jun (p<0.1)
supported by Ki-67 (p<0.05) in the non-embolized liver. In silico analysis of
transcriptomic dysplasia and hepatocellular carcinoma data showed divergent
signatures compared to embolization.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate a sustained regeneration after portal vein
embolization reflected in hyperplasia and angiogenesis in the human liver and
provide novel molecular mechanisms of interlobe crosstalk.

Intermittent social defeat stress enhances mesocorticolimbic <U+0394>FosB/BDNF
co-expression and persistently activates corticotegmental neurons: implication
for vulnerability to psychostimulants.

Intermittent social defeat stress exposure augments behavioral response to
psychostimulants in a process termed cross-sensitization. Brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mediates synaptic plasticity and cellular responses to
stress and drugs of abuse. We previously showed that repeated social defeat
stress persistently alters BDNF and activates <U+0394>FosB expression in
mesocorticolimbic regions. Here, we hypothesized that social defeat stress would 
increase <U+0394>FosB expression in BDNF-containing mesocorticolimbic neurons at a time 
when cross-sensitization is evident. Because the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is 
critical for cross-sensitization, we similarly hypothesized that repeated social 
defeat stress would induce <U+0394>FosB in neurons of mesocorticolimbic terminal regions
that innervate the VTA. We induced social defeat stress in rats by short
confrontations with an aggressive resident rat every third day for 10 days.
Control rats were handled according to the same schedule. Defeated rats exhibited
sensitized locomotor response to amphetamine (1.0mg/kg, i.p.) 10 days after
termination of stress exposure. Separate rats, which underwent stress procedures 
without amphetamine challenge, were used for histological assessments. Rats
received intra-VTA infusion of the retrograde tracer, Fluorogold (FG), and brain 
tissue was collected 10 days after stress or handling for immunohistochemistry.
Stress exposure increased BDNF immunoreactivity in anterior cingulate, prelimbic 
and infralimbic regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), medial amygdala (AMY),
nucleus accumbens (NAc) and VTA; <U+0394>FosB labeling in anterior cingulate cortex
(ACG) and nucleus accumbens; and <U+0394>FosB/BDNF co-expression in prelimbic cortex
(PL), nucleus accumbens and medial amygdala. Infralimbic <U+0394>FosB-labeling was
enhanced by stress in neurons innervating the VTA. Increased <U+0394>FosB/BDNF
co-expression and persistent functional activation of corticolimbic neurons after
stress may contribute to mechanisms underlying cross-sensitization to
psychostimulants.

Methamphetamine (METH) addiction is associated with several neuropsychiatric
symptoms. Little is known about the effects of METH on gene expression and
epigenetic modifications in the rat nucleus accumbens (NAC). Our study
investigated the effects of a non-toxic METH injection (20 mg/kg) on gene
expression, histone acetylation, and the expression of the histone
acetyltransferase (HAT), ATF2, and of the histone deacetylases (HDACs), HDAC1 and
HDAC2, in that structure. Microarray analyses done at 1, 8, 16 and 24 hrs after
the METH injection identified METH-induced changes in the expression of genes
previously implicated in the acute and longterm effects of psychostimulants,
including immediate early genes and corticotropin-releasing factor (Crf). In
contrast, the METH injection caused time-dependent decreases in the expression of
other genes including Npas4 and cholecystokinin (Cck). Pathway analyses showed
that genes with altered expression participated in behavioral performance,
cell-to-cell signaling, and regulation of gene expression. PCR analyses confirmed
the changes in the expression of c-fos, fosB, Crf, Cck, and Npas4 transcripts. To
determine if the METH injection caused post-translational changes in histone
markers, we used western blot analyses and identified METH-mediated decreases in 
histone H3 acetylated at lysine 9 (H3K9ac) and lysine 18 (H3K18ac) in nuclear
sub-fractions. In contrast, the METH injection caused time-dependent increases in
acetylated H4K5 and H4K8. The changes in histone acetylation were accompanied by 
decreased expression of HDAC1 but increased expression of HDAC2 protein levels.
The histone acetyltransferase, ATF2, showed significant METH-induced increased in
protein expression. These results suggest that METH-induced alterations in global
gene expression seen in rat NAC might be related, in part, to METH-induced
changes in histone acetylation secondary to changes in HAT and HDAC expression.
The causal role that HATs and HDACs might play in METH-induced gene expression
needs to be investigated further.

Energy expenditure and bone formation share a common sensitivity to AP-1
transcription in the hypothalamus.

The regulation of bone and fat homeostasis and its relationship to energy
expenditure has recently been the focus of increased attention because of its
potential relevance to osteoporosis, obesity, and diabetes. Although central
effectors within the hypothalamus have been shown to contribute to the regulation
of both energy balance and bone homeostasis, little is known of the underlying
mechanisms, including the possible involvement of transcriptional factors within 
the hypothalamus. Transgenic mice overexpressing <U+0394>FosB, a splice variant of the
AP-1 transcription factor FosB with mixed agonist-antagonistic properties, have
increased energy expenditure and bone mass. Because these mice express <U+0394>FosB in
bone, fat, and hypothalamus, we sought to determine 1) whether overexpression of 
<U+0394>FosB within the hypothalamus was sufficient to regulate energy expenditure and
whether it would also regulate bone mass, and 2) whether these effects were the
result of antagonism to AP-1. Our results show that stereotactic injection of an 
adeno-associated virus vector to restrict overexpression of <U+0394>FosB to the ventral 
hypothalamus of wild-type mice induced a profound increase in both energy
expenditure and bone formation and bone mass. This effect was phenocopied, at an 
even stronger level, by overexpression of a dominant-negative DNJunD, a pure AP-1
antagonist. Taken together, these results suggest that downregulation of AP-1
activity in the hypothalamus profoundly increases energy expenditure and bone
formation, leading to both a decrease in adipose mass and an increase in bone
mass. These findings may have physiological implications because <U+0394>FosB is
expressed and regulated in the hypothalamus.

Neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibition attenuates the development of
L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in hemi-Parkinsonian rats.

Long-term treatment with the dopamine precursor levodopa (l-DOPA) frequently
induces dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease patients, which is a major complication
of this therapy. Previous studies using animal models show that repeated
administration of l-DOPA results in alterations of some signaling molecules,
including <U+0394>FosB, phospho-DARPP32 and phosoho-GluA1 (also referred to as GluR1 or 
GluR-A) AMPA receptor subunits. Moreover, an in vivo microdialysis study showed
that l-DOPA increases nitric oxide (NO) production in the striatum. However, it
is not known whether NO is involved in the development of dyskinesia. The present
study examined the effects of NOS inhibitors on the development of l-DOPA-induced
dyskinesia in the rats. Dyskinesia symptoms were triggered by daily
administration of l-DOPA for 3-4weeks in unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned
rats. Repeated treatments, 30min prior l-DOPA administration, of the nonselective
NOS inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, and the nNOS inhibitor
7-nitroindazole, but not the inducible NOS inhibitor aminoguanidine, attenuated
the development of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. In agreement with the behavioral
analysis, 7-nitroindazole reduced the l-DOPA-induced increases in <U+0394>FosB,
phospho-DARPP32 and phospho-GluA1 AMPA receptor subunit levels in the striatum of
6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats. Furthermore, aminoguanidine did not affect <U+0394>FosB
or phospho-GluA1 AMPA receptor subunit levels. These findings suggest that
nNOS-derived NO is involved in the development of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia
through a post-synaptic mechanism.

BACKGROUND: Apathy is frequently observed in numerous neurological disorders,
including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as well as neuropsychiatric disorders
including schizophrenia. Apathy is defined as a lack of motivation characterized 
by diminished goal-oriented behavior and self-initiated activity. This study
evaluated a chronic restraint stress (CRS) protocol in modeling apathetic
behavior, and determined whether administration of an anticholinesterase had
utility in attenuating CRS-induced phenotypes.
METHODS: We assessed behavior as well as regional neuronal activity patterns
using FosB immunohistochemistry after exposure to CRS for 6 h/d for a minimum of 
21 d. Based on our FosB findings and recent clinical trials, we administered an
anticholinesterase to evaluate attenuation of CRS-induced phenotypes.
RESULTS: CRS resulted in behaviors that reflect motivational loss and diminished 
emotional responsiveness. CRS-exposed mice showed differences in FosB
accumulation, including changes in the cholinergic basal forebrain system.
Facilitating cholinergic signaling ameliorated CRS-induced deficits in initiation
and motivational drive and rescued immediate early gene activation in the medial 
septum and nucleus accumbens.
CONCLUSIONS: Some CRS protocols may be useful for studying deficits in motivation
and apathetic behavior. Amelioration of CRS-induced behaviors with an
anticholinesterase supports a role for the cholinergic system in remediation of
deficits in motivational drive.

Patients with a t(9;11) translocation (MLL-AF9) develop acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), and while in mice the expression of this fusion oncogene also results in
the development of myeloid leukemia, it is with long latency. To identify
mutations that cooperate with Mll-AF9, we infected neonatal wild-type (WT) or
Mll-AF9 mice with a murine leukemia virus (MuLV). MuLV-infected Mll-AF9 mice
succumbed to disease significantly faster than controls presenting predominantly 
with myeloid leukemia while infected WT animals developed predominantly lymphoid 
leukemia. We identified 88 candidate cancer genes near common sites of proviral
insertion. Analysis of transcript levels revealed significantly elevated
expression of Mn1, and a trend toward increased expression of Bcl11a and Fosb in 
Mll-AF9 murine leukemia samples with proviral insertions proximal to these genes.
Accordingly, FOSB and BCL11A were also overexpressed in human AML harboring MLL
gene translocations. FOSB was revealed to be essential for growth in mouse and
human myeloid leukemia cells using shRNA lentiviral vectors in vitro.
Importantly, MN1 cooperated with Mll-AF9 in leukemogenesis in an in vivo BM viral
transduction and transplantation assay. Together, our data identified genes that 
define transcription factor networks and important genetic pathways acting during
progression of leukemia induced by MLL fusion oncogenes.

Long-lasting consequences of neonatal maternal separation on social behaviors in 
ovariectomized female mice.

Tsuda MC(1), Ogawa S.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroendocrinology, Graduate School of Comprehensive 
Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.

Maternal separation (MS) stress is known to induce long-lasting alterations in
emotional and anxiety-related behaviors, but effects on social behaviors are not 
well defined. The present study examined MS effects on female social behaviors in
the social investigation (SIT) and social preference (SPT) tests, in addition to 
non-social behaviors in the open-field (OFT) and light-dark transition (LDT)
tests in C57BL/6J mice. All females were tested as ovariectomized to eliminate
confounding effects of endogenous estrogen during behavioral testing. Daily MS (3
hr) from postnatal day 1 to 14 did not affect anxiety levels in LDT, but were
elevated in OFT with modified behavioral responses to the novel environment.
Furthermore, MS altered social investigative behaviors and preference patterns
toward unfamiliar stimulus mice in SIT and short- and long-term SPT paradigms. In
SIT, MS reduced social investigation duration and increased number of stretched
approaches towards both female and male unfamiliar stimulus mice, suggesting
increased social anxiety levels in MS females. Similarly, MS heightened levels of
social anxiety during short-term SPT but no MS effect on social preference was
found. On the other hand, MS females displayed a distinctive preference for
female stimuli, unlike control females, when tested for long-term SPT over a
prolonged period of 5 days. Evaluation of FosB expression in the paraventricular 
nucleus, medial and central amygdala following stimulus exposure demonstrated
greater number of FosB immunopositive cells in all three brain regions in MS
females compared to control females. These results suggest that MS females might 
differ in neuroendocrine responses toward unfamiliar female and male opponents,
which may be associated with modifications in social behaviors found in the
present study. Taken together, this study provides new evidence that early life
stress modifies female social behaviors by highlighting alterations in behavioral
responses to situations involving social as well as non-social novelty.

Preventive role of social interaction for cocaine conditioned place preference:
correlation with FosB/DeltaFosB and pCREB expression in rat mesocorticolimbic
areas.

The worsening of drug abuse by drug-associated social interaction is a
well-studied phenomenon. In contrast, the molecular mechanisms of the beneficial 
effect of social interaction, if offered as a mutually exclusive choice to drugs 
of abuse, are under-investigated. In a rat place preference conditioning (CPP)
paradigm, four 15 min episodes of social interaction with a gender- and
weight-matched male early-adult conspecific inhibited cocaine-induced
reinstatement of cocaine CPP, a model of relapse. These protective effects of
social interaction were paralleled by a reduced activation, as assessed by Zif268
expression, in brain areas known to play pivotal roles in drug-seeking behavior. 
Here we show that social interaction during extinction of cocaine CPP also
reduced cocaine-CPP-stimulated FosB expression in the nucleus accumbens shell and
core. In addition, social interaction during cocaine CPP extinction increased
pCREB (cAMP response element binding protein) expression in the nucleus accumbens
shell and the cingulate cortex area 1 (Cg1). Our results show that FosB and pCREB
may be implicated in the protective effect of social interaction against
cocaine-induced reinstatement of CPP. Thus, social interaction, if offered in a
context that is clearly distinct from the previously drug-associated one, may
profoundly inhibit relapse to cocaine addiction.

We have investigated the mechanism underlying the immunoregulatory function of
membrane Ig-like transcript 3 (ILT3) and soluble ILT3Fc. microRNA (miRNA)
expression profile identified genes that were downregulated in ILT3-induced human
CD8(+) T suppressor cells (Ts) while upregulated in T cells primed in the absence
of ILT3. We found that miR-21, miR-30b, and miR-155 target the 3'-untranslated
region of genes whose expression was strongly increased in ILT3Fc-induced Ts,
such as dual specificity phosphatase 10, B cell CLL/lymphoma 6, and suppressor of
cytokine signaling 1, respectively. Transfection of miRNA mimics or inhibitors
and site-specific mutagenesis of their 3'-untranslated region binding sites
indicated that B cell CLL/lymphoma 6, dual specificity phosphatase 10, and
suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 are direct targets of miR-30b, miR-21, and
miR-155. Primed CD8(+) T cells transfected with miR-21&30b, miR-21&155, or
miR-21&30b&155 inhibitors displayed suppressor activity when added to autologous 
CD3-triggered CD4 T cells. Luciferase reporter assays of miR-21 and miR-155
indicated that their transcription is highly dependent on AP-1. Analysis of
activated T cells showed that ILT3Fc inhibited the translocation to the nucleus
of the AP-1 subunits, FOSB and c-FOS, and the phosphorylation of ZAP70 and
phospholipase C-<U+03B3> 1. In conclusion, ILT3Fc inhibits T cell activation and induces
the generation of Ts targeting multiple inflammatory miRNA pathways.

Changes in histone acetylation in the prefrontal cortex of ethanol-exposed
adolescent rats are associated with ethanol-induced place conditioning.

Alcohol drinking during adolescence can induce long-lasting effects on the
motivation to consume alcohol. Abnormal plasticity in reward-related processes
might contribute to the vulnerability of adolescents to drug addiction. We have
shown that binge-like ethanol treatment in adolescent rats induces alterations in
the dopaminergic system and causes histone modifications in brain reward regions.
Considering that histone acetylation regulates transcriptional activity and
contributes to drug-induced alterations in gene expression and behavior, we
addressed the hypothesis that ethanol is capable of inducing transcriptional
changes by histone modifications in specific gene promoters in adolescent brain
reward regions, and whether these events are associated with acquisition of place
conditioning. After treating juvenile and adult rats with intermittent ethanol
administration, we found that ethanol treatment upregulates histone acetyl
transferase (HAT) activity in adolescent prefrontal cortex and increases histone 
(H3 or H4) acetylation and H3(K4) dimethylation in the promoter region of cFos,
Cdk5 and FosB. Inhibition of histone deacetylase by sodium butyrate before
ethanol injection enhances both up-regulation of HAT activity and histone
acetylation of cFos, Cdk5 and FosB. Furthermore, co-administration of sodium
butyrate with ethanol prolongs the extinction of conditioned place aversion and
increased the reinstatement effects of ethanol in ethanol-treated adolescents,
but not in ethanol-treated adult rats. These results indicate that ethanol
exposure during adolescence induces chromatin remodeling, changes histone
acetylation and methylation, and modify the effects of ethanol on place
conditioning. They also suggest that epigenetic mechanisms might open up avenues 
to new treatments for binge drinking-induced drug addiction during adolescence.

CONTEXT: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine
disorders in women.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare gene expression pattern in sc abdominal
adipose tissue in nonobese PCOS patients vs. body mass index-matched controls.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eleven PCOS subjects and 12 controls (body mass
index 20-28 kg/m(2)) were recruited. Total RNA was isolated, and gene expression 
profiling was performed using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 arrays. Differentially
expressed genes were classified by gene ontology. Microarray results for selected
genes were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Frequently sampled 
iv glucose tolerance tests were used to assess dynamic insulin sensitivity.
RESULTS: Ninety-six genes were identified with altered expression of at least
2-fold in nonobese PCOS adipose tissues. Inflammatory response genes were
significantly down-regulated. RT-qPCR confirmed decreases in expression of IL6
(12.3-fold), CXCL2 (18.3-fold), and SOCS3 (22.6-fold). Lipid metabolism genes
associated with insulin resistance were significantly up-regulated, with
confirmed increases in DHRS9 (2.5-fold), UCLH1 (2.6-fold), and FADS1 (2.8-fold)
expression. Wnt signaling genes (DKK2, JUN, and FOSB) were differentially
expressed. RT-qPCR confirmed significant expression changes in DKK2 (1.9-fold
increase), JUN (4.1-fold decrease), and FOSB (60-fold decrease).
CONCLUSIONS: Genes involved in inflammation, lipid metabolism, and Wnt signaling 
are differentially expressed in nonobese PCOS adipose tissue. Because these genes
are known to affect adipogenesis and insulin resistance, we hypothesize that
their dysregulation may contribute to the metabolic abnormalities observed in
women with PCOS.

Regulation of the human plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 gene: cooperation 
of an upstream silencer and transactivator.

Stringer B(1), Udofa EA, Antalis TM.

University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, USA.

Transcriptional up-regulation of the plasminogen activator inhibitor type-2
(PAI-2) gene is a major response to cellular stress. The expression of PAI-2 is
induced by a variety of cytokines and growth factors that act in a cell type- and
differentiation stage-dependent manner. We previously reported that the human
SERPINB2 gene promoter is controlled by three major transcription regulatory
domains: an inducible proximal promoter, an upstream silencer (PAUSE-1), and a
distal transactivator region between -5100 and -3300, which appears to overcome
inhibition mediated by the silencer. The distal transactivator region is
inducible by the phorbol ester PMA, a potent activator of the protein kinase C
(PKC) pathway that is a powerful inducer of PAI-2 gene expression in monocytes,
macrophages, and myelomonocytic cells as well as in epidermal keratinocytes. Here
we show that a 21-bp region (-4952/-4932), containing an AP-1 element, is both
necessary and sufficient for PMA-induced transactivator activity in
PAI-2-expressing U937 cells. This site specifically binds FosB in
PAI-2-expressing U937 cells but not in HeLa cells that do not express PAI-2, and 
overexpression of FosB, c-Fos, or c-Jun in HeLa cells is sufficient to cause
derepression of transcription from the SERPINB2 promoter. Although FosB is likely
to be involved in transactivator-mediated derepression of PAI-2 transcription in 
macrophage-like cells, as exemplified by the U937 cell line, c-Jun may be
functional in other cell types. These data suggest a model for the
transcriptional control of the human PAI-2 gene and further our understanding of 
the molecular basis for its tissue-specific expression.

Comparison of <U+0394>FosB immunoreactivity induced by vagal nerve stimulation with that
caused by pharmacologically diverse antidepressants.

(1)Department of Pharmacology, the University of Texas Health Science Center, San
Antonio, Texas, USA.

Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) has been approved for treatment of refractory
depression. However, there have been few, if any, studies directly comparing the 
effects produced by VNS in animals with those caused by antidepressants,
particularly using clinically relevant stimulation parameters in nonanesthetized 
animals. In this study, <U+0394>FosB immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate different
brain regions activated by long-term administration of VNS. Effects of VNS were
compared with those caused by sertraline or desipramine (DMI). Double-labeling of
<U+0394>FosB and serotonin was used to determine whether serotonergic neurons in the
dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) were activated by long-term VNS. VNS significantly
increased <U+0394>FosB staining in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), parabrachial
nucleus (PBN), locus ceruleus (LC), and DRN, as well as in many cortical and
limbic areas of brain including those involved in mood and cognition. Most, but
not all, of these effects were seen also upon long-term treatments of rats with
sertraline or DMI. Some areas where VNS increased <U+0394>FosB (e.g., the NTS, PBN, LC, 
and peripeduncular nucleus) were not affected significantly by either drug.
Sertraline was similar to VNS in causing an increase in the DRN whereas DMI did
not. Double-labeling of the DRN with <U+0394>FosB and an antibody for serotonin revealed
that only a small percentage of <U+0394>FosB staining in the DRN colocalized with
serotonergic neurons. The effects of VNS were somewhat more widespread than those
caused by the antidepressants. The increases in <U+0394>FosB produced by VNS were either
equivalent to and/or more robust than those seen with antidepressants.

Regional c-Fos and FosB/<U+0394>FosB expression associated with chronic methamphetamine 
self-administration and methamphetamine-seeking behavior in rats.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Psychology, Macquarie University, NSW 2109, Sydney, Australia.

The regional expression of the transcription factors c-Fos and FosB/<U+0394>FosB was
examined in rats given acute exposure to intravenous methamphetamine (METH) or
repeated intravenous METH self-administration. One group of rats
self-administered METH via lever pressing in 2 h sessions every day for 3 weeks
and on a final test day received self-administered METH as usual. A second group 
with the same METH self-administration history received saline infusions on the
test day, to induce drug-seeking behavior. Other rats were trained with infusions
of intravenous saline that were yoked to the passive delivery of METH in the
other two groups. On test day, half of these yoked rats received passive METH
infusions for the first time, whereas the others received saline as usual. The
results showed that acute METH produced a characteristic signature of Fos
expression with elevations in striatal, cortical, and extended amygdala regions. 
Importantly, rats with a 3-week history of METH self-administration displayed
similar regional Fos expression to rats receiving METH for the first time. Rats
seeking, but not receiving, METH on the test day had augmented Fos in the lateral
hypothalamus, septum, and vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca, suggesting
a primary role for these regions in METH-seeking behavior. Both acute and chronic
METH activated orexin-positive cells in the perifornical area of the
hypothalamus. FosB/<U+0394>FosB was elevated in the lateral hypothalamus, posterior
ventral tegmental area, central amygdala, and dorsal raphe of all the rats with a
history of METH self-administration. This occurred regardless of whether they
received METH on test day, suggesting presence of the long-lived FosB isoform,
<U+0394>FosB. Overall, these results show persistent upregulated regional brain Fos and 
FosB/<U+0394>FosB expression with chronic METH self-administration and indicate a role
for the lateral hypothalamus and lateral septum in METH-seeking behavior.

Forty-seven vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains were isolated from
clinical samples in 13 Zhejiang hospitals and fecal samples from ICU patients in 
a large teaching hospital in China. No VRE isolates were detected in healthy
human subjects. CC17 was the main clonal complex in clinical Enterococcus faecium
isolates but not in isolates from healthy human subjects. Novel
vancomycin-resistance transposons were detected among VRE strains. This is the
first report demonstrating insertion of tnpA and fosB genes in the vanRS-vanH
intergenic region of Tn1546 leading to coresistance to vancomycin and fosfomycin.
The four plasmid replicon types (pRUM, pRE25, pEF418, and pB82) were more common 
in VRE isolates, suggesting their association with vancomycin resistance and
nosocomial transmission. The prevalence rate of vancomycin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus-related Inc18-like plasmid, pIP501, in VRE was 21.3%. The
prevalence of the esp gene among VRE isolates was high (76.6%). In several VRE
strains, the esp and hyl genes were cotransferred with the vanA gene by
conjugation. Although the frequency of VRE is low in Chinese hospitals, its
association with virulence determinants, the vancomycin-resistance transposon
with other resistance gene insertions or plasmids may lead to multidrug
resistance and the evolution of pathogenic VRE.

Comment in
    Cell Adh Migr. 2013 Jan-Feb;7(1):33-7.

The signaling pathways that commit cells to migration are incompletely
understood. We employed human mammary cells and two stimuli: epidermal growth
factor (EGF), which induced cellular migration, and serum factors, which
stimulated cell growth. In addition to strong activation of ERK by EGF, and AKT
by serum, early transcription remarkably differed: while EGF induced early growth
response-1 (EGR1), and this was required for migration, serum induced c-Fos and
FosB to enhance proliferation. We demonstrate that induction of EGR1 involves
ERK-mediated down-regulation of microRNA-191 and phosphorylation of the ETS2
repressor factor (ERF) repressor, which subsequently leaves the nucleus.
Unexpectedly, knockdown of ERF inhibited migration, which implies migratory roles
for exported ERF molecules. On the other hand, chromatin immunoprecipitation
identified a subset of direct EGR1 targets, including EGR1 autostimulation and
SERPINB2, whose transcription is essential for EGF-induced cell migration. In
summary, EGR1 and the EGF-ERK-ERF axis emerge from our study as major drivers of 
growth factor-induced mammary cell migration.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery
with and without laparoscopic removal of omental fat (omentectomy) on the
temporal gene expression profiles of skeletal muscle.
DESIGN: Previously reported were the whole-body metabolic effects of a
randomized, single-blinded study in patients receiving RYGB surgery stratified to
receive or not receive omentectomy. In this follow up study we report on changes 
in skeletal muscle gene expression in a subset of 21 patients, for whom biopsies 
were collected preoperatively and at either 6 months or 12 months
postoperatively.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: RNA isolated from skeletal muscle biopsies of 21 
subjects (8 without omentectomy and 13 with omentectomy) taken before RYGB or at 
6 and 12 months postoperatively were subjected to gene expression profiling via
Exon 1.0 S/T Array and Taqman Low Density Array. Robust Multichip Analysis and
gene enrichment data analysis revealed 84 genes with at least a 4-fold expression
difference after surgery. At 6 and 12 months the RYGB with omentectomy group
displayed a greater reduction in the expression of genes associated with skeletal
muscle inflammation (ANKRD1, CDR1, CH25H, CXCL2, CX3CR1, IL8, LBP, NFIL3, SELE,
SOCS3, TNFAIP3, and ZFP36) relative to the RYGB non-omentectomy group.
Expressions of IL6 and CCL2 were decreased at all postoperative time points.
There was differential expression of genes driving protein turnover (IGFN1,
FBXW10) in both groups over time and increased expression of PAAF1 in the
non-omentectomy group at 12 months. Evidence for the activation of skeletal
muscle satellite cells was inferred from the up-regulation of HOXC10. The
elevated post-operative expression of 22 small nucleolar RNAs and the decreased
expression of the transcription factors JUNB, FOS, FOSB, ATF3 MYC, EGR1 as well
as the orphan nuclear receptors NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3 suggest dramatic
reorganizations at both the cellular and genetic levels.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data indicate that RYGB reduces skeletal muscle
inflammation, and removal of omental fat further amplifies this response.

The mesopontine rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) is a GABAergic structure in
the ventral midbrain and rostral pons that, when activated, inhibits dopaminergic
neurons in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra compacta. Additional
strong outputs from the RMTg to the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus pars
dissipata, dorsal raphe nucleus, and the pontomedullary gigantocellular reticular
formation were identified by anterograde tracing. RMTg neurons projecting to the 
ventral tegmental area express the immediate early gene Fos upon psychostimulant 
administration. The present study was undertaken to determine if neurons in the
RMTg that project to the additional structures listed above also express Fos upon
psychostimulant administration and, if so, whether single neurons in the RMTg
project to more than one of these structures. We found that about 50% of RMTg
neurons exhibiting retrograde labeling after injections of retrograde tracer in
the dorsal raphe or pars dissipata of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus
express Fos after acute methamphetamine exposure. Also, we observed that a
significant number of RMTg neurons project both to the ventral tegmental area and
one of these structures. In contrast, methamphetamine-elicited Fos expression was
not observed in RMTg neurons labeled with retrograde tracer following injections 
into the pontomedullary reticular formation. The findings suggest that the RMTg
is an integrative modulator of multiple rostrally projecting structures.

Osteosarcoma is a class of cancer originating from the bone, affecting mainly
children and young adults. Cytogenetic studies showed the presence of
rearrangements and recurrent gains in specific chromosomal regions, indicating
the possible involvement of genes located in these regions during the
pathogenesis of osteosarcoma. These studies investigated expression of 10 genes
located in the chromosomal region involved in abnormalities in osteosarcoma,
1p36, 17p, and chromosome 19. The purpose of this study was to investigate the
expression profile of genes located in regions involved in chromosomal
rearrangements in osteosarcoma. We used quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction to investigate the expression of 10 genes located in 1p36.3 (MTHFR,
ERRFI1, FGR, E2F2), 17p (MAPK7, MAP2K4), and chromosome 19 (BBC3, FOSB, JUND, and
RRAS), in 70 samples taken from 30 patients (30 prechemotherapy, 30
postchemotherapy, and 10 metastases specimens) and 10 healthy bones as a control 
sample. The most interesting results showed a strong association between the
expression levels of MAPK7 and MAP2K4 genes and clinical parameters of
osteosarcoma. Overexpression of these genes was significantly associated to a
poor response to treatment (P = .0001 and P = .0049, respectively), tumor
progression, and worse overall survival (P = .0052 and P = .0085, respectively), 
suggesting that MAPK7 and MAP2K4 could play an important role in osteosarcoma
tumorigenesis. Thus, these genes could be good markers in assessing response to
treatment and development of osteosarcoma.

BACKGROUND: Although the higher prevalence of depression in women than in men is 
well known, the neuronal basis of this sex difference is largely elusive.
METHODS: Male and female rats were exposed to chronic variable mild stress (CVMS)
after which immediate early gene products, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)
mRNA and peptide, various epigenetic-associated enzymes and DNA methylation of
the Crf gene were determined in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN),
oval (BSTov) and fusiform (BSTfu) parts of the bed nucleus of the stria
terminalis, and central amygdala (CeA).
RESULTS: CVMS induced site-specific changes in Crf gene methylation in all brain 
centers studied in female rats and in the male BST and CeA, whereas the histone
acetyltransferase, CREB-binding protein was increased in the female BST and the
histone-deacetylase-5 decreased in the male CeA. These changes were accompanied
by an increased amount of c-Fos in the PVN, BSTfu and CeA in males, and of FosB
in the PVN of both sexes and in the male BSTov and BSTfu. In the PVN, CVMS
increased CRF mRNA in males and CRF peptide decreased in females.
CONCLUSIONS: The data confirm our hypothesis that chronic stress affects gene
expression and CRF transcriptional, translational and secretory activities in the
PVN, BSTov, BSTfu and CeA, in a brain center-specific and sex-specific manner.
Brain region-specific and sex-specific changes in epigenetic activity and
neuronal activation may play, too, an important role in the sex specificity of
the stress response and the susceptibility to depression.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons 
in the substantia nigra (SN) and the depletion of striatal dopamine (DA).
Acupuncture, as an alternative therapy for PD, has beneficial effects in both PD 
patients and PD animal models, although the underlying mechanisms therein remain 
uncertain. The present study investigated whether acupuncture treatment affected 
dopamine neurotransmission in a PD mouse model using
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). We found that acupuncture
treatment at acupoint GB34 improved motor function with accompanying dopaminergic
neuron protection against MPTP but did not restore striatal dopamine depletion.
Instead, acupuncture treatment increased dopamine release that in turn, may lead 
to the enhancement of dopamine availability in the synaptic cleft. Moreover,
acupuncture treatment mitigated MPTP-induced abnormal postsynaptic changes,
suggesting that acupuncture treatment may increase postsynaptic dopamine
neurotransmission and facilitate the normalization of basal ganglia activity.
These results suggest that the acupuncture-induced enhancement of synaptic
dopamine availability may play a critical role in motor function improvement
against MPTP.

Identifying the early gene program induced by GnRH would help understand how
GnRH-activated signaling pathways modulate gonadotrope secretory response. We
previously analyzed GnRH-induced early genes in LßT2 cells, however these lack
GnRH self-potentiation, a physiological attribute of gonadotropes. To minimize
cellular heterogeneity, rat primary pituitary cultures were enriched for
gonadotropes by 40-60% using a sedimentation gradient. Given the limited number
of gonadotropes, RNA was amplified prior to microarray analysis. Thirty-three
genes were up-regulated 40 min after GnRH stimulation. Real-time PCR confirmed
regulation of several transcripts including fosB, c-fos, egr-2 and rap1b, a small
GTPase and member of the Ras family. GnRH stimulated rap1b gene expression in
gonadotropes, measured by a sensitive single cell assay. Immunocytochemistry
revealed increased Rap1 protein in GnRH-stimulated gonadotropes. These data
establish rap1b as a novel gene rapidly induced by GnRH and a candidate to
modulate gonadotropin secretion in rat gonadotropes.

Pain behavior and spinal cell activation due to carrageenan-induced inflammation 
in two inbred rat strains with differential hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
reactivity.

Lewis (LEW) and Fischer (FIS) inbred rats were used to study the relationship of 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity with inflammation-related
pain behavior. LEW rats are susceptible to the development of autoimmune and
chronic inflammatory disorders, whereas FIS rats are resistant. Since
contradictory data have previously been collected under conditions of acute
inflammation, we investigated the onset and maintenance of thermal and mechanical
hyperalgesia and spinal activation of neurons and glia cells in a model of
ongoing inflammation in both strains. Hind paw volumes and mechanical and thermal
pain thresholds were measured prior to and during one week after intraplantar
injection of carrageenan. The activation of nociceptive neurons (FosB), astroglia
(GFAP) and microglia (OX-42) in the spinal cord of segments L5/L6 was assessed
using immunohistochemistry. Inflammation increased paw volume, pain sensitivity
and cell activation in both strains. FIS rats were more sensitive to sensory
stimulation and developed a more severe edema on day 1, but recovered faster up
to day 7 than LEW rats. At that time a higher amount of activated nociceptive
neurons and corticosterone was seen in FIS rats, but microglial activation was
more pronounced in LEW rats. Our results suggest a biphasic role of the HPA axis 
in pain behavior and spinal cell activation associated with ongoing inflammation.
In the acute stage, the stronger reaction in FIS rats might be explained by an
activating effect of corticosteroids on neutrophil function. Under ongoing
inflammatory conditions the immunosuppressive actions of corticosteroids may
dominate and lead to a quicker recovery of paw volume and pain sensitivity in FIS
rats.

Stromal components interact with cancer cells to promote growth and metastasis.
The purpose of this study was to identify genes expressed in stroma, which could 
provide prognostic information in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Seventy-four
patients were included. We performed gene expression profiling and confirmed
array data using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. By microarray analysis, 52
candidate genes associated with progression free survival (PFS) were identified
(P < 0.005). Expression of the early growth response 1 (EGR1) and FBJ murine
osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (FOSB) genes was further analyzed. Array
data were confirmed by RT-PCR and multivariate analysis demonstrated that both
EGR1 and FOSB expression in cancer stroma, and EGR1 expression in cancer are
independent prognostic factors in EOC. Immunohistochemically, EGR1 protein is
localized in cancer cells and a-smooth muscle actin positive stromal fibroblasts.
The EGR1 and FOSB expression in stromal cells and EGR1 expression in cancer cells
are prognostic indicators in EOC.

Global expression analysis identified a preferentially nerve growth
factor-induced transcriptional program regulated by sustained mitogen-activated
protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and AP-1 protein
activation during PC12 cell differentiation.

Neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells in response to NGF is a prototypical model
in which signal duration determines a biological response. Sustained ERK activity
induced by NGF, as compared with transient activity induced by EGF, is critical
to the differentiation of these cells. To characterize the transcriptional
program activated preferentially by NGF, we compared global gene expression
profiles between cells treated with NGF and EGF for 2-4 h, when sustained ERK
signaling in response to NGF is most distinct from the transient signal elicited 
by EGF. This analysis identified 69 genes that were preferentially up-regulated
in response to NGF. As expected, up-regulation of these genes was mediated by
sustained ERK signaling. In addition, they were up-regulated in response to other
neuritogenic treatments (pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide and
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate plus dbcAMP) and were enriched for genes
related to neuronal differentiation/function. Computational analysis and
chromatin immunoprecipitation identified binding of CREB and AP-1 family members 
(Fos, FosB, Fra1, JunB, JunD) upstream of >30 and 50%, respectively, of the
preferentially NGF-induced genes. Expression of several AP-1 family members was
induced by both EGF and NGF, but their induction was more robust and sustained in
response to NGF. The binding of Fos family members to their target genes was
similarly sustained in response to NGF and was reduced upon MEK inhibition,
suggesting that AP-1 contributes significantly to the NGF transcriptional
program. Interestingly, Fra1 as well as two other NGF-induced AP-1 targets
(HB-EGF and miR-21) function in positive feedback loops that may contribute to
sustained AP-1 activity.

Complex behaviors, such as learning and memory, are associated with rapid changes
in gene expression of neurons and subsequent formation of new synaptic
connections. However, how external signals are processed to drive specific
changes in gene expression is largely unknown. We found that the genome organizer
protein Satb1 is highly expressed in mature neurons, primarily in the cerebral
cortex, dentate hilus, and amygdala. In Satb1-null mice, cortical layer
morphology was normal. However, in postnatal Satb1-null cortical pyramidal
neurons, we found a substantial decrease in the density of dendritic spines,
which play critical roles in synaptic transmission and plasticity. Further, we
found that in the cerebral cortex, Satb1 binds to genomic loci of multiple
immediate early genes (IEGs) (Fos, Fosb, Egr1, Egr2, Arc, and Bdnf) and other key
neuronal genes, many of which have been implicated in synaptic plasticity. Loss
of Satb1 resulted in greatly alters timing and expression levels of these IEGs
during early postnatal cerebral cortical development and also upon stimulation in
cortical organotypic cultures. These data indicate that Satb1 is required for
proper temporal dynamics of IEG expression. Based on these findings, we propose
that Satb1 plays a critical role in cortical neurons to facilitate neuronal
plasticity.

Molecular mechanism for a gateway drug: epigenetic changes initiated by nicotine 
prime gene expression by cocaine.

In human populations, cigarettes and alcohol generally serve as gateway drugs,
which people use first before progressing to marijuana, cocaine, or other illicit
substances. To understand the biological basis of the gateway sequence of drug
use, we developed an animal model in mice and used it to study the effects of
nicotine on subsequent responses to cocaine. We found that pretreatment of mice
with nicotine increased the response to cocaine, as assessed by addiction-related
behaviors and synaptic plasticity in the striatum, a brain region critical for
addiction-related reward. Locomotor sensitization was increased by 98%,
conditioned place preference was increased by 78%, and cocaine-induced reduction 
in long-term potentiation (LTP) was enhanced by 24%. The responses to cocaine
were altered only when nicotine was administered first, and nicotine and cocaine 
were then administered concurrently. Reversing the order of drug administration
was ineffective; cocaine had no effect on nicotine-induced behaviors and synaptic
plasticity. Nicotine primed the response to cocaine by enhancing its ability to
induce transcriptional activation of the FosB gene through inhibition of histone 
deacetylase, which caused global histone acetylation in the striatum. We tested
this conclusion further and found that a histone deacetylase inhibitor simulated 
the actions of nicotine by priming the response to cocaine and enhancing FosB
gene expression and LTP depression in the nucleus accumbens. Conversely, in a
genetic mouse model characterized by reduced histone acetylation, the effects of 
cocaine on LTP were diminished. We achieved a similar effect by infusing a low
dose of theophylline, an activator of histone deacetylase, into the nucleus
accumbens. These results from mice prompted an analysis of epidemiological data, 
which indicated that most cocaine users initiate cocaine use after the onset of
smoking and while actively still smoking, and that initiating cocaine use after
smoking increases the risk of becoming dependent on cocaine, consistent with our 
data from mice. If our findings in mice apply to humans, a decrease in smoking
rates in young people would be expected to lead to a decrease in cocaine
addiction.

Dopamine D1 receptor modulation in nucleus accumbens lowers voluntary wheel
running in rats bred to run high distances.

of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri 65211, USA.

Dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been postulated to
influence reward development towards drugs of abuse and exercise. Herein, we used
generation 4-5 rats that were selectively bred to voluntary run high (HVR) versus
low (LVR) distances in order to examine if dopamine-like 1 (D1) receptor
modulation in the NAc differentially affects nightly voluntary wheel running
between these lines. A subset of generation 5-6 HVR and LVR rats were also used
to study the mRNA expression of key genes related to reward and addiction in the 
NAc (i.e., DRD1, DRD5, DRD2, Nr4a2, FosB, and BDNF). In a crossover fashion, a
D1-like agonist SKF 82958 (2 µg per side) or D1-like full antagonist SCH 23390 (4
µg per side) was bilaterally injected into the NAc of HVR and LVR female Wistar
rats prior to their high running nights. Notably, during hours 2-4 (between 2000 
and 2300) of the dark cycle there was a significant decrement in running
distances in the HVR rats treated with the D1 agonist (p=0.025) and antagonist
(p=0.017) whereas the running distances in LVR rats were not affected.
Interestingly, HVR and LVR rats possessed similar NAc concentrations of the
studied mRNAs. These data suggest that: a) animals predisposed to run high
distances on a nightly basis may quickly develop a rewarding response to exercise
due to an optimal D1-like receptor signaling pathway in the NAc that can be
perturbed by either activation or blocking, b) D1-like agonist or antagonist
injections do not increase running distances in rats that are bred to run low
nightly distances, and c) running differences between HVR and LVR animals are
seemingly not due to the expression of the studied mRNAs. Given the societal
prevalence of obesity and extraneous physical inactivity, future studies should
be performed in order to further determine the culprit for the low running
phenotype observed in LVR animals.

Fibroproliferative remodeling in smooth muscle-rich hollow organs is associated
with aberrant extracellular matrix (ECM) production. Although mechanical stimuli 
regulate ECM protein expression, the transcriptional mediators of this process
remain poorly defined. Previously, we implicated AP-1 as a mediator of smooth
muscle cell (SMC) mechanotransduction; however, its role in stretch-induced ECM
regulation has not been explored. Herein, we identify a novel role for the AP-1
subunit FosB in stretch-induced ECM expression in SMCs. The DNA-binding activity 
of AP-1 increased after stretch stimulation of SMCs in vitro. In contrast to
c-Jun and c-fos, which are also activated by the SMC mitogen platelet-derived
growth factor, FosB was only activated by stretch. FosB silencing attenuated the 
expression of the profibrotic factors tenascin C (TNC) and connective tissue
growth factor (CTGF), whereas forced expression of Jun~FosB stimulated TNC and
CTGF promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed enrichment of AP-1
at the TNC and CTGF promoters. Bladder distension in vivo enhanced nuclear
localization of c-jun and FosB. Finally, the distension-induced expression of TNC
and CTGF in the detrusor smooth muscle of bladders from wild-type mice was
significantly attenuated in FosB-null mice. Together, these findings identify
FosB as a mechanosensitive regulator of ECM production in smooth muscle.

Imidazoline receptor antisera-selected/Nischarin regulates the effect of agmatine
on the development of morphine dependence.

Agmatine, an endogenous ligand for imidazoline receptor, has been shown to
prevent opioid dependence, but not much is known about the mechanisms of the
effect of agmatine. In the present study, we investigated the function of I1
imidazoline receptor and its candidate protein imidazoline receptor
antisera-selected (IRAS)/Nischarin in morphine dependence as well as in the
effect of agmatine inhibiting morphine dependence by pharmacological and
molecular approaches. Results showed that inhibition of IRAS or Nischarin did not
change the development of morphine dependence in vitro and in vivo under the
basal condition. Agmatine could reduce the cyclic 3', 5' adenosine monophosphate 
(cAMP) overshoot at the concentration of 0.01-10 µM in the primary cultured rat
hippocampal neurons and attenuated the withdrawal signals and the elevation of
FosB and <U+0394>FosB at the dose of 5 mg/kg in the morphine-dependent mice. The effect 
of agmatine was inhibited by efaroxan (I1 imidazoline receptor non-specific
antagonist) and the RNA interference against IRAS or Nischarin. These findings
indicate that I1 imidazoline receptor or IRAS/Nischarin mediates the effect of
agmatine on morphine dependence and provide evidence that I1 imidazoline receptor
may be a new target for treating morphine dependence.

MAPK and AP-1 proteins are increased in term pre-labour fetal membranes overlying
the cervix: regulation of enzymes involved in the degradation of fetal membranes.

Fetal membranes overlying the cervix (i.e. supracervical site, SCS) are
characterised by increased extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. In
non-gestational tissues, the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and
activator protein (AP)-1 family are involved in the regulation of the ECM
degrading enzyme metalloproteinase (MMP)-9. The aims of this study were (i) to
compare the expression of AP-1 proteins in fetal membranes from the SCS and a
distal site (DS), and (ii) determine if the MAPK/AP-1 pathway is involved in the 
regulation of MMP-9. Fetal membranes overlying the cervix were identified in situ
in women undergoing term elective Caesarean section. Immunohistochemistry (n = 6)
was used to localise the expression of the MAPK proteins ERK (total and
phosphorylated), JNK (total and phosphorylated) and p38 MAPK (total and
phosphorylated), and the AP-1 proteins JunB, cJun (total and phosphorylated),
JunD, cFos and FosD. There was no difference in JNK, p38 MAPK, FosB, cJun and
JunD protein expression between SC and distal fetal membranes. However, when
compared to DS, the intensity and/or extent of staining of ERK, p-ERK, p-JNK,
p-p38 MAPK, cFos, JunB and p-cJun were greater in amnion and chorion obtained
from the SCS. In order to elucidate a role for these proteins in ECM degradation,
pharmacological inhibitors of MAPK protein activation were utilised in primary
amnion cells. The ERK inhibitor U0126, JNK inhibitor SP600125 and p38 MAPK
inhibitor SB202190 all significantly decreased IL-ß-induced MMP-9 gene expression
and pro MMP-9 in human primary amnion cells. In summary, at term, non laboured SC
fetal membranes are characterised by increased expression of MAPK and AP-1
proteins. MMP-9 expression and production was significantly suppressed by
inhibitors of three key enzymes in the signalling cascades leading to AP-1
formation, ERK 1/2, JNK and p38 MAPK. Thus, the MAPK/AP-1 pathway may play a role
in the degradation of the ECM at the SCS making it more susceptible to membrane
rupture.

BACKGROUND: Elevated expression of the transcription factor <U+0394>FosB accompanies
repeated exposure to drugs of abuse, particularly in brain areas associated with 
reward and motivation (e.g., nucleus accumbens). The persistent effects of <U+0394>FosB 
on target genes might play an important role in the development and expression of
behavioral adaptations that characterize addiction. This study examines how <U+0394>FosB
influences the responsiveness of the brain reward system to rewarding and
aversive drugs.
METHODS: We used the intracranial self-stimulation paradigm to assess the effects
of cocaine in transgenic mice with inducible overexpression of <U+0394>FosB in striatal 
regions (including nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum). Mice implanted with
lateral hypothalamic stimulating electrodes were trained with the
"rate-frequency" procedure for intracranial self-stimulation to determine the
frequency at which stimulation becomes rewarding (threshold).
RESULTS: A dose-effect analysis of cocaine effects revealed that mice
overexpressing <U+0394>FosB show increased sensitivity to the rewarding
(threshold-lowering) effects of the drug, compared with littermate control
subjects. Interestingly, mice overexpressing <U+0394>FosB were also less sensitive to
the pro-depressive (threshold-elevating) effects of U50488, a kappa-opioid
agonist known to induce dysphoria and stress-like effects in rodents.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that induction of <U+0394>FosB in striatal regions has
two important behavioral consequences-increased sensitivity to drug reward, and
reduced sensitivity to aversion-producing a complex phenotype that shows signs of
vulnerability to addiction as well as resilience to stress.

Unilateral nigrostriatal 6-hydroxydopamine lesions in mice II: predicting
l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.

In the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned rodent the location of the lesion
produces significantly different behavioural phenotypes, responses to the
dopamine precursor l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) and neuropathology.
Lesion extent is commonly determined by a series of motor tests, but whether any 
of these tests have a relationship to the development and predictability of
dyskinesia is unknown. We used mice with 6-OHDA lesions of the striatum, medial
forebrain bundle and substantia nigra to examine the relationship between a range
of tests used to determine motor function in the absence of l-DOPA: rotarod,
cylinder, corridor, the balance beam, locomotor activity, psycho-stimulant and
spontaneous rotational behaviour. The mice were subsequently treated with l-DOPA 
in progressively increasing doses and the development of l-DOPA-induced
dyskinesia assessed. Most of these tests predict dopamine depletion but only
rotarod, spontaneous rotations, apomorphine-induced rotations and locomotor
activities were significantly correlated with the development of dyskinesia at
6mg/kg and 25mg/kg l-DOPA. The losses of dopaminergic neurons and serotonergic
density in the ventral and dorsal striatum were dependent upon lesion type and
were also correlated with l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. The expression of FosB/<U+0394>FosB
was differentially affected in the striatum and nucleus accumbens regions in
dyskinetic mice according to lesion type.

Binding site specificity and factor redundancy in activator protein-1-driven
human papillomavirus chromatin-dependent transcription.

Author information:

Activator protein-1 (AP-1) regulates diverse gene responses triggered by
environmental cues and virus-induced cellular stress. Although many signaling
events leading to AP-1 activation have been described, the fundamental features
underlying binding site selection and factor recruitment of dimeric AP-1
complexes to their target genes remain mostly uncharacterized. Using recombinant 
full-length human AP-1 dimers formed between c-Jun and Fos family members (c-Fos,
FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2) for DNA binding and transcriptional analysis, we found that
each of these AP-1 complex exhibits differential activity for distinct
non-consensus AP-1 sites present in human papillomavirus (HPV), and each AP-1
complex is capable of activating transcription from in vitro-reconstituted HPV
chromatin in a p300- and acetyl-CoA-dependent manner. Transcription from HPV
chromatin requires AP-1-dependent and contact-driven recruitment of p300.
Acetylation of dimeric AP-1 complexes by p300 enhances AP-1 binding to DNA. Using
a human C-33A cervical cancer-derived cell line harboring the episomal HPV type
11 genome, we illustrate binding site selectivity recognized by c-Jun, JunB,
JunD, and various Fos family members in a combinatorial and unique pattern,
highlighting the diversity and importance of non-canonical binding site
recognition by various AP-1 family proteins.

Regulation of osteoblast differentiation by interleukin-11 via AP-1 and Smad
signaling.

Mechanical stress and parathyroid hormone (PTH) are major stimulators, and aging 
and glucocorticoids excess are important suppressors of osteoblast
differentiation. Mechanical stress and PTH stimulate interleukin (IL)-11
expression in cells of osteoblast lineage by enhancing transcription of IL-11
gene via an increase in intracellular Ca²<U+207A>. The elevated Ca²<U+207A> activates
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) to enhance phosphorylation of cyclic 
AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which binds to the fosB gene
promoter and enhances <U+0394>FosB expression. <U+0394>FosB dimerizes with JunD on the IL-11
gene promoter to enhance its transcription. Both mechanical stress and PTH also
stimulate phosphorylation of Smad1 via an activation of protein kinase Cd (PKCd).
Phosphorylated Smad1 binds to the IL-11 gene promoter and forms complex with
<U+0394>FosB/JunD to further enhance IL-11 gene transcription. The increased IL-11 then 
suppresses expression of Wnt inhibitors, including Dickkopf 1 (Dkk1) and 2, and
enhances Wnt signaling to stimulate osteoblast differentiation and inhibit
adipocyte differentiation. The suppression of osteoblast differentiation by aging
involves a decrease in IL-11 gene transcription by a reduction in JunD binding to
the activator protein (AP)-1 site of the IL-11 gene promoter. Glucocorticoids
inhibit transcriptional activation of IL-11 gene by an interaction of
glucocorticoid-glucocorticoid receptor (GR) complex with <U+0394>FosB/JunD heterodimer. 
Thus, factors that enhance osteoblast differentiation stimulate, and those which 
suppress osteoblast differentiation inhibit IL-11 gene transcription, and IL-11
enhances Wnt signaling by suppressing expression of its inhibitors. These
observations are consistent with the notion that IL-11 mediates stimulatory and
inhibitory signals of osteoblast differentiation by affecting Wnt signaling.

corticotropin-releasing factor-producing neurons in the rat paraventricular

Male and female rodents respond differently to acute stress. We tested our
hypothesis that this sex difference is based on differences in stress sensitivity
of forebrain areas, by determining possible effects of a single acute psychogenic
stressor (1-hr restraint stress) on neuronal gene expression (c-Fos and FosB
immunoreactivities), storage of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)
immunoreactivity, and CRF production (CRF mRNA in situ hybridization) as well as 
the expression of genes associated with epigenetic processes (quantitative
RT-PCR) in the rat paraventricular nucleus (PVN), the oval and fusiform
subdivisions of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTov and BSTfu,
respectively), and the central amygdala (CeA), in both males and females.
Compared with females, male rats responded to the stressor with a stronger rise
in corticosterone titer and a stronger increase in neuronal contents of c-Fos,
CRF mRNA, and CREB-binding protein mRNA in the PVN. In the BSTov, females but not
males showed an increase in c-Fos, whereas the CRF mRNA content was increased in 
males only. In the BSTfu, males and females showed similar stress-induced
increases in c-Fos and FosB, whereas in the CeA, both sexes revealed similar
increases in c-Fos and in CRF mRNA. We conclude that male and female rats differ 
in their reactivity to acute stress with respect to possibly epigenetically
mediated (particularly in the PVN) neuronal gene expression and neuropeptide
dynamics (PVN and BSTov) and that this difference may contribute to the sex
dependence of the animal's physiological and behavioral responses to an acute
stressor.

Time to freezing tumor tissue for RNA expression analysis will always vary to
some extent. To evaluate the effect of ischemia time, tumor tissue from ten
breast cancer patients was collected and aliquots of tissue were snap frozen at
different time points after surgery (0, 0.5, 1, 3 and 6 h). Using miRNA and mRNA 
expression microarrays and statistical analysis, 56 miRNAs and 1788 mRNAs were
found to be significantly altered with ischemia time up to six hours. Several of 
the 56 miRNAs have been reported to play a role in cancer, such as hsa-miR-663
and hsa-miR-125a-3p. Known stress response genes such as GADD45B, JUND and FOSB
were among the mRNAs most significantly affected by time to freezing. A novel
statistical method for identification of consistently correlated miRNA-mRNA pairs
and miRNA-associated biological processes in time course data is presented.
Application of this method revealed that several miRNAs, including hsa-miR-1228, 
hsa-miR-1225-5p and hsa-miR-574-5p, were associated through their correlation to 
mRNAs to biological processes such as "response to stimulus" and "stress
response". These miRNAs also showed enrichment of predicted targets among either 
their positively or negatively correlated mRNAs. The induced miRNAs may play both
direct and indirect roles in biological responses. Caution should be taken when
the miRNAs and mRNAs reported to be affected by ischemia time are included in a
prognostic or predictive signature.

Cannabidiol-treated rats exhibited higher motor score after cryogenic spinal cord
injury.

Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive constituent of cannabis, has been reported 
to induce neuroprotective effects in several experimental models of brain injury.
We aimed at investigating whether this drug could also improve locomotor recovery
of rats submitted to spinal cord cryoinjury. Rats were distributed into five
experimental groups. Animals were submitted to laminectomy in vertebral segment
T10 followed or not by application of liquid nitrogen for 5 s into the spinal
cord at the same level to cause cryoinjury. The animals received injections of
vehicle or CBD (20 mg/kg) immediately before, 3 h after and daily for 6 days
after surgery. The Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan motor evaluation test was used
to assess motor function post-lesion one day before surgery and on the first,
third, and seventh postoperative days. The extent of injury was evaluated by
hematoxylin-eosin histology and FosB expression. Cryogenic lesion of the spinal
cord resulted in a significant motor deficit. Cannabidiol-treated rats exhibited 
a higher Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor score at the end of the first
week after spinal cord injury: lesion + vehicle, day 1: zero, day 7: four, and
lesion + Cannabidiol 20 mg/kg, day 1: zero, day 7: seven. Moreover, at this
moment there was a significant reduction in the extent of tissue injury and FosB 
expression in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The present study confirmed
that application of liquid nitrogen to the spinal cord induces reproducible and
quantifiable spinal cord injury associated with locomotor function impairments.
Cannabidiol improved locomotor functional recovery and reduced injury extent,
suggesting that it could be useful in the treatment of spinal cord lesions.

Effect of <U+0394>FosB overexpression on opioid and cannabinoid receptor-mediated
signaling in the nucleus accumbens.

Studies, Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, Richmond, VA 23298,

The stable transcription factor <U+0394>FosB is induced in the nucleus accumbens (NAc)
by chronic exposure to several drugs of abuse, and transgenic expression of <U+0394>FosB
in the striatum enhances the rewarding properties of morphine and cocaine.
However, the mechanistic basis for these observations is incompletely understood.
We used a bitransgenic mouse model with inducible expression of <U+0394>FosB in dopamine
D(1) receptor/dynorphin-containing striatal neurons to determine the effect of
<U+0394>FosB expression on opioid and cannabinoid receptor signaling in the NAc. Results
showed that mu opioid-mediated G-protein activity and inhibition of adenylyl
cyclase were enhanced in the NAc of mice that expressed <U+0394>FosB. Similarly, kappa
opioid inhibition of adenylyl cyclase was enhanced in the <U+0394>FosB expressing mice. 
In contrast, cannabinoid receptor-mediated signaling did not differ between mice 
overexpressing <U+0394>FosB and control mice. These findings suggest that opioid and
cannabinoid receptor signaling are differentially modulated by expression of
<U+0394>FosB, and indicate that <U+0394>FosB expression might produce some of its effects via
enhanced mu and kappa opioid receptor signaling in the NAc.

Opiate sensitization induces FosB/<U+0394>FosB expression in prefrontal cortical,
striatal and amygdala brain regions.

Sensitization to the effects of drugs of abuse and associated stimuli contributes
to drug craving, compulsive drug use, and relapse in addiction. Repeated opiate
exposure produces behavioral sensitization that is hypothesized to result from
neural plasticity in specific limbic, striatal and cortical systems. <U+0394>FosB and
FosB are members of the Fos family of transcription factors that are implicated
in neural plasticity in addiction. This study examined the effects of
intermittent morphine treatment, associated with motor sensitization, on
FosB/<U+0394>FosB levels using quantitative immunohistochemistry. Motor sensitization
was tested in C57BL/6 mice that received six intermittent pre-treatments (on days
1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12) with either subcutaneous morphine (10 mg/kg) or saline
followed by a challenge injection of morphine or saline on day 16. Mice receiving
repeated morphine injections demonstrated significant increases in locomotor
activity on days 8, 10, and 12 of treatment (vs. day 1), consistent with
development of locomotor sensitization. A morphine challenge on day 16
significantly increased locomotor activity of saline pre-treated mice and
produced even larger increases in motor activity in the morphine pre-treated
mice, consistent with the expression of opiate sensitization. Intermittent
morphine pre-treatment on these six pre-treatment days produced a significant
induction of FosB/<U+0394>FosB, measured on day 16, in multiple brain regions including 
prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) cortex, nucleus accumbens (NAc) core,
dorsomedial caudate-putamen (CPU), basolateral amygdala (BLA) and central nucleus
of the amygdala (CNA) but not in a motor cortex control region. Opiate induced
sensitization may develop via Fos/<U+0394>FosB plasticity in motivational pathways
(NAc), motor outputs (CPU), and associative learning (PL, IL, BLA) and stress
pathways (CNA).

In cardiac myoblasts, cellular redox regulates FosB and Fra-1 through multiple
cis-regulatory modules.

Jindal E(1), Goswami SK.

Author information: 
(1)School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi 110067, India.

Depending on the dose, norepineprine (NE) can induce hypertrophy or apoptosis in 
cardiac myocytes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in mediating both
responses, but the mechanisms are not understood as yet. Earlier we demonstrated 
that the two pathways are marked by the differential induction of FosB and Fra-1,
two members of the AP-1 family of transcription factors. We now demonstrate that 
NE induces both fosB and fra-1 at the transcriptional level. Catalase and MnTMPyP
(a superoxide dismutase mimetic) suppress their activation by NE. In contrast, in
cells without NE treatment, MnTMPyP upregulates their expression, whereas
catalase inhibits it. Thus, regulation of fosB and fra-1 by ROS is context
specific. To delineate the mechanisms, the 1493- and 2689-bp upstream regions of 
the fosB and fra-1 genes were cloned into the luciferase vector and assayed for
transient expression. Catalase and MnTMPyP regulated both promoters the same as
their endogenous counterparts in NE-treated and untreated cells. Deletion,
mutation, and ChIP analyses suggested that multiple cis-elements including SP-1, 
CEBP, and AP-1 in the fosB promoter make discrete contributions to mediating the 
redox response. A gel mobility-shift-based oxidation-reduction assay suggested
that, whereas SP-1 is a direct sensor of cellular redox state, CEBP is not. This 
study suggests that multiple redox signals generate gene-specific modules
affecting their expression.

Acute administration of the dopamine D(4) receptor (D(4)R) agonist PD168,077
induces a down-regulation of the µ opioid receptor (MOR) in the striosomal
compartment of the rat caudate putamen (CPu), suggesting a striosomal D(4)R/MOR
receptor interaction in line with their high co-distribution in this brain
subregion. The present work was designed to explore if a D(4)R/MOR receptor
interaction also occurs in the modulation of the expression pattern of several
transcription factors in striatal subregions that play a central role in drug
addiction. Thus, c-Fos, FosB/<U+0394>FosB and P-CREB immunoreactive profiles were
quantified in the rat CPu after either acute or continuous (6-day) administration
of morphine and/or PD168,077. Acute and continuous administration of morphine
induced different patterns of expression of these transcription factors, effects 
that were time-course and region dependent and fully blocked by PD168,077
co-administration. Moreover, this effect of the D(4)R agonist was counteracted by
the D(4)R antagonist L745,870. Interestingly, at some time-points, combined
treatment with morphine and PD168,077 substantially increased c-Fos, FosB/<U+0394>FosB
and P-CREB expression. The results of this study give indications for a general
antagonistic D(4)R/MOR receptor interaction at the level of transcription
factors. The change in the transcription factor expression by D(4)R/MOR
interactions in turn suggests a modulation of neuronal activity in the CPu that
could be of relevance for drug addiction.

Quantitative mapping of cocaine-induced <U+0394>FosB expression in the striatum of male 
and female rats.

<U+0394>FosB plays a critical role in drug-induced long-term changes in the brain. In
the current study, we evaluated locomotor activity in male and female rats
treated with saline or cocaine for 2 weeks and quantitatively mapped <U+0394>FosB
expression in the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens of each animal by using
an anti-FosB antibody that recognizes <U+0394>FosB isoforms preferentially. Behavioral
analysis showed that while there was little difference between males and females 
that sensitized to cocaine, nonsensitizing rats showed a large sex difference.
Nonsensitizing males showed low behavioral activation in response to cocaine on
the first day of treatment, and their activity remained low. In contrast,
nonsensitizing females showed high activation on the first day of treatment and
their activity remained high. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses
indicated that basal levels of <U+0394>FosB were higher in the nucleus accumbens than
the dorsal striatum, but that the effect of cocaine on <U+0394>FosB was greater in the
dorsal striatum. Immunostaining showed that the effect of cocaine in both the
dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens was primarily to increase the intensity of 
<U+0394>FosB immunoreactivity in individual neurons, rather than to increase the number 
of cells that express <U+0394>FosB. Detailed mapping of <U+0394>FosB-labeled nuclei showed that
basal <U+0394>FosB levels were highest in the medial portion of the dorsal striatum and 
dorsomedial accumbens, particularly adjacent to the lateral ventricle, whereas
the cocaine-induced increase in <U+0394>FosB was most pronounced in the lateral dorsal
striatum, where basal <U+0394>FosB expression was lowest. Sex differences in <U+0394>FosB
expression were small and independent of cocaine treatment. We discuss
implications of the sex difference in locomotor activation and
regionally-specific <U+0394>FosB induction by cocaine.

Changes in maternal gene expression in olfactory circuits in the immediate
postpartum period.

(1)Department of Neurosurgery, Yale University School of Medicine New Haven, CT, 
USA.

Regulation of maternal behavior in the immediate postpartum period involves
neural circuits in reward and homeostasis systems responding to cues from the
newborn. Our aim was to assess one specific regulatory mechanism: the role that
olfaction plays in the onset and modulation of parenting behavior. We focused on 
changes in gene expression in olfactory brain regions, examining nine genes found
in previous knockout studies to be necessary for maternal behavior. Using a
quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based approach, we assessed changes in gene expression in
response to exposure to pups in 11 microdissected olfactory brain regions. Over
the first postpartum days, all nine genes were detected in all 11 regions (at
differing levels) and their expression changed in response to pup exposure. As a 
general trend, five genes (Dbh, Esr1, FosB, Foxb1, and Oxtr) were found to
decrease their expression in most of the olfactory regions examined, while two
genes (Mest and Prlr) were found to increase expression. Nos1 and Peg3 levels
remained relatively stable except in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), where
greater than fourfold increases in expression were observed. The largest
magnitude expression changes in this study were found in the AOB, which mediates 
a variety of olfactory cues that elicit stereotypic behaviors such as mating and 
aggression as well as some non-pheromone odors. Previous analyses of null mice
for the nine genes assessed here have rarely examined olfactory function. Our
data suggest that there may be olfactory effects in these null mice which
contribute to the observed maternal behavioral phenotypes. Collectively, these
data support the hypothesis that olfactory processing is an important sensory
regulator of maternal behavior.

study were to investigate the decrease of l-DOPA-induced abnormal involuntary
movements (AIMs) in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats by nitric oxide
inhibitors following either acute or chronic treatment. The primary findings of
this study were that NG-nitro-l-Arginine, an inhibitor of endothelial and
neuronal nitric oxide synthase, attenuated AIMs induced by chronic and acute
l-DOPA. In contrast, rotational behavior was attenuated only after chronic
l-DOPA. The 6-OHDA lesion and the l-DOPA treatment induced a bilateral increase
(1.5 times) in the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) protein and nNOS mRNA in
the striatum and in the frontal cortex. There was a parallel increase,
bilaterally, of the FosB/<U+0394>FosB, primarily in the ipsilateral striatum. The
exception was in the contralateral striatum and the ipsilateral frontal cortex,
where chronic l-DOPA treatment induced an increase of approximately 10 times the 
nNOS mRNA. Our results provided further evidence of an anti-dyskinetic effect of 
NOS inhibitor. The effect appeared under l-DOPA acute and chronic treatment. The 
l-DOPA treatment also revealed an over-expression of the neuronal NOS in the
frontal cortex and striatum. Our results corroborated findings that
l-DOPA-induced rotation differs between acute and chronic treatment. The effect
of the NOS inhibitor conceivably relied on the l-DOPA structural modifications in
the Parkinsonian brain. Taken together, these data provided a rationale for
further evaluation of NOS inhibitors in the treatment of l-DOPA-induced
dyskinesia.

We investigated the mechanisms responsible for increased blood pressure and
sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) caused by 2-3 days dehydration (DH) both in vivo
and in situ preparations. In euhydrated (EH) rats, systemic application of the
AT(1) receptor antagonist Losartan and subsequent pre-collicular transection (to 
remove the hypothalamus) significantly reduced thoracic (t)SNA. In contrast, in
DH rats, Losartan, followed by pre-collicular and pontine transections, failed to
reduce tSNA, whereas transection at the medulla-spinal cord junction massively
reduced tSNA. In DH but not EH rats, selective inhibition of the commissural
nucleus tractus solitarii (cNTS) significantly reduced tSNA. Comparable data were
obtained in both in situ and in vivo (anaesthetized/conscious) rats and suggest
that following chronic dehydration, the control of tSNA transfers from
supra-brainstem structures (e.g. hypothalamus) to the medulla oblongata,
particularly the cNTS. As microarray analysis revealed up-regulation of AP1
transcription factor JunD in the dehydrated cNTS, we tested the hypothesis that
AP1 transcription factor activity is responsible for dehydration-induced
functional plasticity. When AP1 activity was blocked in the cNTS using a viral
vector expressing a dominant negative FosB, cNTS inactivation was ineffective.
However, tSNA was decreased after pre-collicular transection, a response similar 
to that seen in EH rats. Thus, the dehydration-induced switch in control of tSNA 
from hypothalamus to cNTS seems to be mediated via activation of AP1
transcription factors in the cNTS. If AP1 activity is blocked in the cNTS during 
dehydration, sympathetic activity control reverts back to forebrain regions. This
unique reciprocating neural structure-switching plasticity between brain centres 
emphasizes the multiple mechanisms available for the adaptive response to
dehydration.

Erratum in
    Biol Psychiatry. 2012 Sep 1;72(5):429.

BACKGROUND: Molecular mechanisms underlying stress tolerance and vulnerability
are incompletely understood. The fosB gene is an attractive candidate for
regulating stress responses, because <U+0394>FosB, an alternative splice product of the 
fosB gene, accumulates after repeated stress or antidepressant treatments. On the
other hand, FosB, the other alternative splice product of the fosB gene,
expresses more transiently than <U+0394>FosB but exerts higher transcriptional activity.
However, the functional differences of these two fosB products remain unclear.
METHODS: We established various mouse lines carrying three different types of
fosB allele, wild-type (fosB(+)), fosB-null (fosB(G)), and fosB(d) allele, which 
encodes <U+0394>FosB but not FosB, and analyzed them in stress-related behavioral tests.
RESULTS: Because fosB(+/d) mice show enhanced <U+0394>FosB levels in the presence of
FosB and fosB(d/d) mice show more enhanced <U+0394>FosB levels in the absence of FosB,
the function of FosB can be inferred from differences observed between these
lines. The fosB(+/d) and fosB(d/d) mice showed increased locomotor activity and
elevated Akt phosphorylation, whereas only fosB(+/d) mice showed
antidepressive-like behaviors and increased E-cadherin expression in striatum
compared with wild-type mice. In contrast, fosB-null mice showed increased
depression-like behavior and lower E-cadherin expression.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that FosB is essential for stress tolerance 
mediated by <U+0394>FosB. These data suggest that fosB gene products have a potential to
regulate mood disorder-related behaviors.

Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, 185 South Orange Avenue, Newark, NJ 07101, 
USA.

BACKGROUND: It is well established that all drugs of abuse converge onto common
circuitry and induce chronic addiction by modulating the addictive signaling
molecules such as DeltaFosB in the mesocorticolimbic system. Recent case reports 
suggest that propofol may have abuse potential. However, there is no direct
evidence showing that propofol has an effect on the key addictive signaling
molecules in the mesocorticolimbic system. In this study, we determined the
effect of propofol on the expression of DeltaFosB in rat nucleus accumbens (NAc) 
and the potential mechanism involved.
METHODS: To determine the effect of propofol on the expression of DeltaFosB in
rat NAc, 2 well-known addictive agents, ethanol and nicotine, were used as
positive controls. Experiments were conducted on 36 male Sprague-Dawley rats (150
to 200 g). These animals were divided into 4 treatment groups: vehicle (saline), 
propofol (10 mg/kg), ethanol (1 g/kg), and nicotine (0.5 mg/kg). All drugs were
administered by intraperitoneal injection twice per day for 7 days. The animals
were then killed and their NAc were isolated for DeltaFosB measurements.
RESULTS: As expected, both ethanol and nicotine significantly increased DeltaFosB
expression. Intriguingly, propofol elicited a robust increase in DeltaFosB
expression similar to that of ethanol and nicotine. Moreover, the dopamine
receptor D1, an upstream molecule of DeltaFosB, was also significantly
upregulated by propofol.
CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, we have identified, for the first time, that
propofol is able to induce the addictive signaling molecule DeltaFosB in NAc via 
dopamine receptor D1. This new evidence at the molecular level suggests that
propofol may have abuse potential.

prefrontal cortex of patients with major depressive disorder.

BP 37013, 21070 Dijon, France. teyssier@u-bourgogne.fr

BACKGROUND: A <U+0394>FOSB mediated transcriptional response in the nucleus accumbens
(NAc) is induced by chronic social stress in rodent and a 50% down-regulation of 
<U+0394>FOSB has been also reported in the NAc of eight depressed subjects. To evaluate 
the role of <U+0394>FOSB in the prefrontal cortex which is critically involved in
negative cognitive bias associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) we have
quantified the mRNA levels of <U+0394>FOSB and of five of its major target genes in the 
Brodmann area 46 from 24 patients with MDD (11 with psychotic symptoms) and 12
controls.
METHOD: Expression of the six genes has been quantified by a real-time
quantitative PCR method: <U+0394>FOSB, GRIA2 (encoding the GluR2 subunit of the AMPA
receptor), SPARCL1 (encoding hevin), SG3 (encoding the secretogranin III), PCP4
(encoding the Purkinje cell protein 4), ATP6V0C (encoding a subunit of the
lysosomal ATPase).
RESULTS: Expression of <U+0394>FOSB and GRIA2 was significantly up-regulated (˜ 1.60) in
the BA 46 of MDD patients. Overexpression of SCG3 and PCP4 was restricted to
psychotic subjects. The mRNA levels of GRIA2, SCG3 and PCP4 were strongly
correlated in the depressed group.
LIMITATIONS: All the patients were treated by antidepressants and the number of
subjects in each subgroup was rather small.
CONCLUSIONS: Induction of a <U+0394>FOSB mediated transcriptional pattern in the
prefrontal cortex is opposite to the down-regulation observed in the NAc. The
major consequence might be a shift in the excitability of the glutamatergic
synapses which depends on GluR2 (high in the NAc and low in the BA 46).

A series of new aporphine analogues (aporlogues) were synthesized bearing a C-,
N-, or O-linkage at the C11 position. Lipoic ester (-)-15 was identified as a
full agonist at the dopamine D(2) and serotonin 5-HT(1A) receptors with K(i)
values of 174 and 66 nM, respectively. It elicited antiparkinsonian action on
Parkinsin's disease (PD) rats with minor dyskinesia. Chronic use of (-)-15
reduced L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) without attenuating the antiparkinsonian 
effect. These results suggest that 5-HT(1A) and D(2) dual-receptor agonist (-)-15
may present a novel candidate drug in the treatment of PD and LID.

Voluntary exercise improves high-fat diet-induced leptin resistance independent
of adiposity.

The efficacy of exercise as primary prevention of obesity is the subject of
intense investigation. Here, we show that voluntary exercise in a mouse strain
susceptible to diet-induced obesity (C57B6J) decreases fat mass and increases
energy expenditure. In addition, exercise attenuates obesity in mice fed a
high-fat diet (HFD). Using FosB immunoreactivity as a marker of chronic neuronal 
activation, we found that exercise activates leptin receptor-positive neurons in 
the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, involved in homeostatic control of energy 
balance. FosB immunoreactivity in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus is
decreased in sedentary mice exposed to HFD but is increased in exercised mice
independent of adiposity. To determine whether the antiobesity effects of
voluntary exercise improve central nervous system (CNS) leptin action, we
measured the anorectic and weight reducing effects of intracerebroventricular
(ICV) leptin in sedentary and exercised mice exposed to HFD (EH), as well as in
sedentary mice that have been calorie restricted (SR) to match the fat mass of EH
mice. ICV leptin was ineffective in lowering food intake and body weight (BW) in 
sedentary mice exposed to HFD mice. The anorectic potency of leptin was partially
restored in EH and SR groups. However, ICV leptin significantly lowered BW in EH 
but not SR mice. Thus, exercise leads to the maintenance of a lower BW and leaner
composition, as well as to improved CNS leptin action, independent of fat mass.
These results support the notion that physical exercise directly influences the
responsiveness of the CNS circuits involved in energy homeostasis by allowing the
defense of a lowered BW.

Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate of all of the cancers in the world and
asbestos-related lung cancer is one of the leading occupational cancers. The
identification of asbestos-related molecular changes has long been a topic of
increasing research interest. The aim of this study was to identify novel
asbestos-related molecular correlates by integrating miRNA expression profiling
with previously obtained profiling data (aCGH and mRNA expression) from the same 
patient material. miRNA profiling was performed on 26 tumor and corresponding
normal lung tissue samples from highly asbestos-exposed and non-exposed patients,
and on eight control lung tissue samples. Data analyses on miRNA expression, and 
integration of miRNA and previously obtained mRNA data were performed using
Chipster. A separate analysis was used to integrate miRNA and previously obtained
aCGH data. Both known and new lung cancer-associated miRNAs and target genes with
inverse correlation were discovered. Furthermore, DNA copy number alterations
(e.g., gain at 12p13.31) were correlated with the deregulated miRNAs.
Specifically, thirteen novel asbestos-related miRNAs (over-expressed: miR-148b,
miR-374a, miR-24-1*, Let-7d, Let-7e, miR-199b-5p, miR-331-3p, and miR-96 and
under-expressed: miR-939, miR-671-5p, miR-605, miR-1224-5p and miR-202) and
inversely correlated target genes (e.g., GADD45A, LTBP1, FOSB, NCALD, CACNA2D2,
MTSS1, EPB41L3) were identified. In addition, over-expression of the well known
squamous cell carcinoma-associated miR-205 was linked to down-regulation of the
DOK4 gene. The miRNAs/genes presented here may represent interesting targets for 
further investigation and could eventually have potential diagnostic
implications.

Chronic intermittent hypoxia increases blood pressure and expression of
FosB/DeltaFosB in central autonomic regions.

Worth, TX 76107, USA.

Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) models repetitive bouts of arterial hypoxemia 
that occur in humans suffering from obstructive sleep apnea. CIH has been linked 
to persistent activation of arterial chemoreceptors and the renin-angiotensin
system, which have been linked to chronic elevations of sympathetic nerve
activity (SNA) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Because Fos and FosB are
transcription factors involved in activator protein (AP)-1 driven central nervous
system neuronal adaptations, this study determined if CIH causes increased Fos or
FosB staining in brain regions that regulate SNA and autonomic function. Male
Sprague Dawley rats were instrumented with telemetry transmitters for continuous 
recording of MAP and heart rate (HR). Rats were exposed to continuous normoxia
(CON) or to CIH for 8 h/day for 7 days. CIH increased MAP by 7-10 mmHg without
persistently affecting HR. A separate group of rats was killed 1 day after 7 days
of CIH for immunohistochemistry. CIH did not increase Fos staining in any brain
region examined. Staining for FosB/<U+0394>FosB was increased in the organum vasculosum 
of the lamina terminalis (CON: 9 ± 1; CIH: 34 ± 3 cells/section), subfornical
organ (CON: 7 ± 2; CIH: 31 ± 3), median preoptic nucleus (CON 15 ± 1; CIH: 38 ±
3), nucleus of the solitary tract (CON: 9 ± 2; CIH: 28 ± 4), A5 (CON: 3 ± 1; CIH:
10 ± 1), and rostral ventrolateral medulla (CON: 5 ± 1; CIH: 17 ± 2). In the
paraventricular nucleus, FosB/<U+0394>FosB staining was located mainly in the dorsal and
medial parvocellular subnuclei. CIH did not increase FosB/<U+0394>FosB staining in
caudal ventrolateral medulla or supraoptic nucleus. These data indicate that CIH 
induces an increase in FosB/<U+0394>FosB in autonomic nuclei and suggest that AP-1
transcriptional regulation may contribute to stable adaptive changes that support
chronically elevated SNA.

AP-1 protein induction during monopoiesis favors C/EBP: AP-1 heterodimers over
C/EBP homodimerization and stimulates FosB transcription.

Comment in
    J Leukoc Biol. 2011 Oct;90(4):637-8.

AP-1 proteins heterodimerize via their LZ domains to bind TGACGTCA or TGACTCA,
whereas C/EBPs dimerize to bind ATTGCGCAAT. We demonstrate that intact C/EBPa
also heterodimerizes with c-Jun or c-Fos to bind a hybrid DNA element, TGACGCAA, 
or more weakly to TGATGCAA. A 2:1 ratio of c-Jun:C/EBPa or c-Fos:C/EBPa was
sufficient for preferential binding. Semiquantitative Western blot analysis
indicates that the summation of c-Jun, JunB, and c-Fos levels in differentiating 
myeloid cells is similar to or exceeds the entirety of C/EBPa and C/EBPß,
indicating the feasibility of heterodimer formation. Induction of AP-1 proteins
during monocytic differentiation favored formation of C/EBP:AP-1 heterodimers,
with C/EBPa homodimers more evident during granulopoiesis. Approximately 350
human and 300 murine genes contain the TGACGCAA motif between -2 kb and +1 kb of 
their transcription start sites. We focused on the murine Fosb promoter, which
contains a C/EBP:AP-1 cis element at -56 and -253, with the hFOSB gene containing
an identical site at -253 and a 1-bp mismatch at -56. C/EBPa:AP-1 heterodimers
bound either site preferentially in a gel-shift assay, C/EBPa:c-Fos ER fusion
proteins induced endogenous Fosb mRNA but not in the presence of CHX, C/EBP and
AP-1 proteins bound the endogenous Fosb promoter, mutation of the -56 cis element
reduced reporter activity fivefold, and endogenous FosB protein was expressed
preferentially during monopoiesis versus granulopoiesis. Increased expression of 
Jun/Fos proteins elevates C/EBP:AP-1 heterodimer formation to potentially
activate novel sets of genes during monopoiesis and potentially during other
biologic processes.

Modulation of oxidative stress responses in the human retinal pigment epithelium 
following treatment with vitamin C.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Ophthalmology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center,
Memphis, Tennessee, USA.

Oxidative stress (OS) in the retina plays an important role in the development
and progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Our previous work has 
shown that OS can quantitatively regulate the expression of AP-1 family genes in 
the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In this study, we sought to determine
whether AP-1 genes can be used as cellular biomarkers of OS to evaluate the
efficacy of ascorbate, the major aqueous-phase antioxidant in the blood, in
reducing OS in RPE cells in vitro. Human ARPE19 cells were pretreated with
increasing levels of ascorbate (0-500 µM) for 3 days which was then removed from 
the medium. OS was induced 24 h later by the addition of hydrogen peroxide for
1-4 h, to bring the final media concentration of H(2)O(2) to 500 µM. FosB, c-Fos,
and ATF3 gene expression was examined from 0 to 24 h after OS. Pretreatment with 
200 µM ascorbate maximally reduced the transcriptional OS response of AP-1 genes 
by up to 87% after 1 and 4<U+2009>h, compared to controls. One hundred micromolar of
ascorbate provided a statistically significant, but far more modest effect.
Ascorbate supplementation of 100-200 µM appears to strongly inhibit OS-induced
activation of AP-1 in vitro, but pretreatment with higher levels of ascorbate
conferred no additional advantage. These studies suggest that there are optimal
levels of antioxidant supplementation to the RPE in vitro. Laboratory assays
based upon transcription factor biomarkers may be useful to define beneficial
molecular responses to new antioxidants, alternative dosing regimens, and to
explore therapeutic efficacy in OS models in vitro.

MicroRNA-155 is involved in the remodelling of human-trophoblast-derived
HTR-8/SVneo cells induced by lipopolysaccharides.

Dai Y(1), Diao Z, Sun H, Li R, Qiu Z, Hu Y.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nanjing University Medical School,

BACKGROUND: A low dose injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) may induce
pre-eclampsia-like symptoms in rats, and microRNA-155 (miR-155) is elevated in
the placentas of patients with pre-eclampsia. Our goal was to investigate the
association of miR-155 with pre-eclampsia and the pathways involved using
human-trophoblast-derived cell line (HTR-8/SVneo) stimulated with LPS.
METHODS: We measured miR-155 in HTR-8/SVneo cells treated with LPS (25-800 ng/ml)
using real-time PCR. Western blotting was used to study transcription factor
activated protein 1 (AP-1) (JunB and FosB subunits) and nuclear factor (NF)-<U+03BA>B
p65 in the HTR-8/SVneo cells and placentas from patients with pre-eclampsia. DNA 
precipitation assays and luciferase reporter analysis were used to evaluate the
regulation of miR-155 by AP-1 and NF-<U+03BA>B. Cell migration was determined by scratch
assay. Syncytialization of HTR-8/SVneo cells was analysed following transfection 
with miR-155.
RESULTS: miR-155 was increased together with AP-1 and NF-<U+03BA>B in HTR-8/SVneo cells 
incubated with low dose of LPS (=100 ng/ml; P < 0.05 versus baseline). Both
JunB/FosB and p65 were increased in placenta from women with severe pre-eclampsia
versus a normal pregnancy, with elevated expression of miR-155 (P < 0.05). For
specific DNA-binding sites upstream of BIC/miR-155 gene promoter, the AP-1 site
was more important than the NF-<U+03BA>B site for increasing miR-155 in HTR-8/SVneo
cells. The cells with enforced expression of miR-155 showed a reduced ability to 
migrate (P < 0.05) and an increased number of syncytiotrophoblast-like
multinuclear cells (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: LPS may induce remodelling of the human-trophoblast-derived
HTR-8/SVneo cells by increasing miR-155, acting in part through the AP-1 and
NF-<U+03BA>B pathways.

Environmental enrichment confers stress resiliency to social defeat through an
infralimbic cortex-dependent neuroanatomical pathway.

Regulation, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health,

Enriched environmental (EE) housing dampens stress-induced alterations in
neurobiological systems, promotes adaptability, and extinguishes submissive
behavioral traits developed during social defeat stress (SD). In the present
study, we hypothesized that enrichment before SD can confer stress resiliency
and, furthermore, that neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is
requisite for this resiliency. To test these hypotheses, mice were housed in EE, 
standard (SE), or impoverished (IE) housing and then exposed to SD. EE conferred 
resilience to SD as measured in several behavioral tasks. EE-housed mice
expressed elevated FosB/<U+0394>FosB immunostaining in areas associated with emotional
regulation and reward processing, i.e., infralimbic, prelimbic, and anterior
cingulate cortices, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens, and this expression was
mostly preserved in mice receiving EE followed by SD. In contrast, in SE- or
IE-housed animals, SD increased maladaptive behaviors and greatly reduced
FosB/<U+0394>FosB staining in the forebrain. We tested the putative involvement of the
PFC in mediating resilience by lesioning individual regions of the PFC either
before or after EE housing and then exposing the mice to SD. We found that
discrete lesions of the infralimbic but not prelimbic or cingulate cortex made
before but not after EE abolished the behavioral resiliency to stress afforded by
EE and attenuated FosB/<U+0394>FosB expression in the accumbens and amygdala while
increasing it in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus. These data suggest
that pathological ventromedial PFC outputs to downstream limbic targets could
predispose an individual to anxiety disorders in stressful situations, whereas
enhanced ventromedial PFC outputs could convey stress resilience.

A study was carried out to examine the effects of acute and chronic L-DOPA
treatment on the distribution of the immediate-early gene (IEG) proteins (FosB,
c-Fos, and Zif268) in forebrain regions in a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine
(6-OHDA) rat model of Parkinson's disease. During a course of chronic L-DOPA
treatment (15 mg/day, 15 days), rats with a 6-OHDA lesion developed abnormal
involuntary movements. Compared with the rats in the acute L-DOPA treatment
group, those in the chronic treatment group had significantly more
FosB-immunopositive cells in the anterior cingulate (Cg) and the dorsolateral
caudate-putamen ipsilateral to the lesion and significantly fewer
c-Fos-immunopositive cells in the Cg, the nucleus accumbens shell, and the
basolateral nucleus of amygdala ipsilateral to the lesion. No significant
difference was observed in the number of Zif268-immunopositive cells between the 
acute and chronic L-DOPA groups. In summary, differential expression of three IEG
proteins was observed in the forebrain regions during a course of chronic L-DOPA 
treatment of 6-OHDA-treated hemiparkinsonian rats.

Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent central nervous system diseases imposing
a high social burden to our society. Emotional processing is particularly
controlled by GABA-ergic transmission in the amygdala. Using in situ
hybridization and immunohistochemistry we now investigated changes in the
expression of GABA synthesizing enzymes (GAD65 and GAD67), GABA(A) (a1-5, ß1-3,
<U+03B3>1-2) and GABA(B) receptor subunits (GBBR1, GBBR2) in amygdaloid nuclei of high
anxiety-related behavior (HAB) mice in comparison to mice selected for normal
anxiety-related behavior (NAB). Levels of GAD65 and GAD67 mRNAs and protein, as
well as those of GABA were increased in the amygdala of HAB mice. Relative to NAB
controls, mRNA expression of the GABA(A) receptor subunits ß1, ß2 and <U+03B3>2 was
specifically increased in the basolateral amygdala of HAB mice while
transcription of a5 and <U+03B3>1 subunits was reduced in the central and medial
amygdala. On the protein level, increases in ß2 and <U+03B3>2 subunit immunoreactivities
were evident in the basolateral amygdala of HAB mice. No change in GABA(B)
receptor expression was observed. These findings point towards an imbalanced
GABA-ergic neurotransmission in the amygdala of HAB mice. On the other hand,
FosB, a marker for neuronal activity, was increased in principal neurons of the
basolateral amygdala in HAB mice, reflecting activation of excitatory neurons,
possibly as a consequence of reduced GABA-ergic tonic inhibition through a5 and
<U+03B3>1 containing receptors. Ultimately these mechanisms may lead to the compensatory
activation of GABA transmission, as indicated by the increased expression of
GAD65/67 in HAB mice.

adult striatal neurons.

Numerous studies with the neural activity marker Fos indicate that cocaine
activates only a small proportion of sparsely distributed striatal neurons. Until
now, efficient methods were not available to assess neuroadaptations induced
specifically within these activated neurons. We used fluorescence-activated cell 
sorting (FACS) to purify striatal neurons activated during cocaine-induced
locomotion in naive and cocaine-sensitized cfos-lacZ transgenic rats. Activated
neurons were labeled with an antibody against ß-galactosidase, the protein
product of the lacZ gene. Cocaine induced a unique gene expression profile
selectively in the small proportion of activated neurons that was not observed in
the nonactivated majority of neurons. These genes included altered levels of the 
immediate early genes arc, fosB, and nr4a3, as well as genes involved in p38 MAPK
signaling and cell-type specificity. We propose that this FACS method can be used
to study molecular neuroadaptations in specific neurons encoding the behavioral
effects of abused drugs and other learned behaviors.

Insulin-like growth factor 1 activates methionine adenosyltransferase 2A
transcription by multiple pathways in human colon cancer cells.

Diseases, Southern California Research Center for ALPD and Cirrhosis, Keck School

We have previously reported that the expression of MAT2A (methionine
adenosyltransferase 2A) is increased in human colon cancer and in colon cancer
cells treated with IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1), which was required for
its mitogenic effect. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the molecular
mechanisms of IGF-1-mediated MAT2A induction. Nuclear run-on analysis confirmed
that the increase in MAT2A expression lies at the transcriptional level. DNase I 
footprinting of the MAT2A promoter region revealed a similar protein-binding
pattern in colon cancer and IGF-1-treated RKO cells. IGF-1 induced MAT2A promoter
activity and increased nuclear protein binding to USF (upstream stimulatory
factor)/c-Myb, YY1 (Yin and Yang 1), E2F, AP-1 (activator protein 1) and NF-<U+03BA>B
(nuclear factor <U+03BA>B) consensus elements. IGF-1 increased the expression of c-Jun, 
FosB, MafG, p65, c-Myb, E2F-1 and YY1 at the pre-translational level. Knockdown
of p65, MafG, c-Myb or E2F-1 lowered basal MAT2A expression and blunted the
inductive effect of IGF-1 on MAT2A, whereas knockdown of YY1 increased basal
MAT2A expression and had no effect on IGF-1-mediated MAT2A induction.
Consistently, mutation of AP-1, NF-<U+03BA>B, E2F and USF/c-Myb elements individually
blunted the IGF-1-mediated increase in MAT2A promoter activity, and combined
mutations completely prevented the increase. In conclusion, IGF-1 activates MAT2A
transcription by both known and novel pathways. YY1 represses MAT2A expression.

deltaFosB, a naturally occurring truncated isform of fosB gene, existed in many
tissues stably and played an important role in formation and differentiation of
adipocyte and osteoblast. deltaFosB may be related to the metabolism of calcium
in bone and mammary gland and regulate the signal pathway of calcium transfer
from bone to mammary gland. We first sub-cloned deltafosB gene of goat into the
vector pET32a to construct prokaryotic expression vector pET32a-deltafosB. Then
we induced for deltafosB gene expression efficiently by IPTG. Finally we
immunized the adult rabbits with purified recombinant deltaFosB to prepare rabbit
anti-goat deltaFosB polyclonal antibody. iELISA analysis showed the antibody with
the titer of 1:51 200, and Western blotting result showed that the antibody could
specifically detect the deltaFosB protein expressed in prokaryotic cell and
HEK-293 cell, respectively. Further Western blotting assay showed that deltaFosB 
expressed in various tissues of goat in vivo.

The orphan G-protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37) colocalizes with the dopamine
(DA) transporter (DAT) in mouse nigrostriatal presynaptic membranes, and its
genetic ablation in homozygous null-mutant (GPR37-KO) mice provokes the marked
increase of plasma membrane expression of DAT, alteration of
psychostimulant-induced locomotor activity, and reduction of catalepsy induced by
DA-receptor antagonists. We report that extracts from GPR37-KO mice displayed
biochemical alterations of the nigrostriatal signaling pathways mediated by D1
and D2 dopaminergic receptors. Null-mutant mice showed an increase of the basal
phosphorylation level of the D2-regulated Akt kinase. The basal phosphorylation
of the D1-activated ERK2 kinase was not altered, but acute treatments with
amphetamine or cocaine failed to produce its specific increase, as detected in
samples from wild-type littermates. Furthermore, the chronic administration of
cocaine to GPR37-KO mice did not increase the expression of the <U+0394>FosB
transcription factor isoforms. Consistently, behavioral analysis showed that
null-mutant animals did not respond to the incentive properties of amphetamine or
cocaine, in conditioned place preference tests. Thus, the lack of GPR37 affects
both ERK2- and Akt-mediated striatal signaling pathways, impairing the
biochemical and behavioral responses typically induced by acute and chronic
administration of psychostimulant drugs.

Vagus nerve stimulation has been used for the treatment of neuropsychiatric
disorders, such as epilepsy. However, little is known whether it is also
effective for the treatment of heroin dependence, in particular for relapse to
heroin seeking. In the present study, we investigated the effects of vagus nerve 
stimulation on reinstatement (relapse) of heroin-seeking behavior induced by
heroin priming or heroin-associated cues. The rats were trained for heroin
self-administration for 14days and followed by extinction training in which
heroin was replaced by saline and heroin-associated cues were turned off. In
addition, animals were also received daily electric stimulation of vagus nerve
(30Hz, pulse width of 0.5ms, 0.5mA (low-intensity) or 1mA (high-intensity); 30s
on, 5min off; 10 continuous cycle per day) or false stimulation during extinction
training. We found that such vagus nerve stimulation significantly inhibited
heroin priming (0.25mg/kg, s.c.) - or heroin-associated conditioned cue-induced
reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior, when compared to false stimulation
control. Further, such a behavioral inhibition was correlated to a reduction in
the expression of FosB and an increase in the expression of phosphorylation of
cAMP response element binding protein (p-CREB) in nucleus accumbens. The data
suggest that vagus nerve stimulation may inhibit heroin- or heroin cue-induced
relapse, possibly by regulation of the expression of Fos and CREB in nucleus
accumbens.

Single nucleotide polymorphism (rs1997794) in promoter of the prodynorphin gene
(PDYN) associated with alcohol-dependence may impact PDYN transcription in human 
brain. To address this hypothesis we analyzed PDYN mRNA levels in the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dl-PFC) and hippocampus, both involved in
cognitive control of addictive behavior and PDYN promoter SNP genotype in
alcohol-dependent and control human subjects. The principal component analysis
suggested that PDYN expression in the dl-PFC may be related to alcoholism, while 
in the hippocampus may depend on the genotype. We also demonstrated that the T,
low risk SNP allele resides within noncanonical AP-1-binding element that may be 
targeted by JUND and FOSB proteins, the dominant AP-1 constituents in the human
brain. The T to C transition abrogated AP-1 binding. The impact of genetic
variations on PDYN transcription may be relevant for diverse adaptive responses
of this gene to alcohol.

6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions are being used in the mouse for basic research
on Parkinson's disease and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. We set out to compare
unilateral lesion models produced by intrastriatal or intramesencephalic
injections of a fixed 6-OHDA concentration (3.2 µg/µl) in C57BL/6 mice. In the
first experiment, toxin injections were performed either at two striatal
coordinates (1 or 2 µl per site, termed "striatum(2 × 1 µl)" and "striatum(2 × 2 
µl)" models), in the medial forebrain bundle (MFB), or in the substantia nigra
pars compacta (SN) (1 µl per site). All the four lesion models produced
significant forelimb use asymmetry, but spontaneous turning asymmetry only
occurred in the MFB and striatum(2 × 2 µl) models. After the behavioral studies, 
the induction of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2
(pERK1/2) by acute L-DOPA (30 mg/kg) was used as a marker of post-synaptic
supersensitivity. Striatal pERK1/2 expression was sparse in the SN and striatum(2
× 1 µl) groups, but pronounced in the striatum(2 × 2 µl) and MFB-lesioned mice.
In further experiments, mice with MFB and striatal(2 × 2 µl) lesions were used to
compare behavioral and molecular responses to chronic L-DOPA treatment (12 days
at 3 and 6 mg/kg/day). Maximally severe abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs)
occurred in all MFB-lesioned mice, whereas only 35% of the mice with striatal
lesions developed dyskinesia. Striatal tissue levels of dopamine were
significantly lower in the dyskinetic animals (both MFB and striatum(2 × 2 µl)
groups) in comparison with the non-dyskinetic ones. Noradrenaline levels were
significantly reduced only in MFB lesioned animals and did not differ among the
dyskinetic and non-dyskinetic cases with striatal lesions. In all groups, the
L-DOPA-induced AIM scores correlated closely with the number of cells
immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase or FosB/<U+2206>FosB in the striatum. In
conclusion, among the four lesion procedures examined here, only the MFB and
striatum(2 × 2 µl) models yielded a degree of dopamine denervation sufficient to 
produce spontaneous postural asymmetry and molecular supersensitivity to L-DOPA. 
Both lesion models are suitable to reproduce L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, although 
only MFB lesions yield a pronounced and widespread expression of post-synaptic
supersensitivity markers in the striatum.

Gene action plays a role in neural cell migration, learning processes, stress
response, drug addiction, cancer, mental health, psychiatric and neurological
disorders, as well as neurodegenerative diseases. Studies also show that
upregulation of certain gene activities in neurons may contribute to the
development of Alzheimer's disease and other progressive cognitive disorders many
decades after the alteration itself occurs. Endogenous, environmental
stress-related, or drug-induced chemical imbalances in the brain affect the
homeostasis of gene activities in neurons in specific brain regions and
contribute to the comorbidity of mental illness and substance dependence. On the 
other hand, altered gene activities are also a necessary part of repair processes
after brain injury. Our general well-being is governed by the highly regulated
gene activities in our brains. A better understanding of gene activities and
their relationship to the progression of neurological disease can help the
research and medical communities develop necessary measures for early
intervention, as well as plan more appropriate interventions or new therapeutic
approaches that can benefit a broad spectrum of patients who will be or have been
affected by brain diseases. We developed a non-invasive imaging technique that
allows real-time assessment of gene transcription profiles in live brains. This
imaging method has the potential to provide first-hand information about the
progression of neurological disorders by gene targeting and cell typing, and it
could elucidate a surrogate marker for therapeutic efficacy for future planning
of treatments for human diseases. We have established a workable and reproducible
MRI technique in live rodent brains.

The simultaneous localization of several anatomical markers is often required to 
understand and analyze the organization of complex brain nuclei or identify
neuronal networks recruited during a specific biological stimulus. Gathering such
information is usually achieved by the combined detection of both mRNA and
proteins. Staining techniques using fluorescence have progressively overtaken the
use of radioactive tissue labeling and immunostaining based on the
avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex. Despite the promise offered by the combination 
of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunofluorescence (IF), in terms
of reduced bench time and easy visualization of multiple labels at once, some
technical hurdles have to be overcome to produce reliable data from these
state-of-the-art neuroanatomy techniques. Here, we have adapted a combination of 
FISH and IF for slices mounted on a microscope slide, using mRNA (GAD65 mRNA) and
proteins (NeuN, FosB or TH) widely studied in neuroanatomy, to validate this
method. Proteinase K (PK), which is often used to optimize riboprobe penetration,
is a major limiting factor in obtaining successful IF labeling. This study
demonstrates the inaccuracy of PK and provides appropriate tools to improve the
efficiency of the combined FISH-IF procedure to obtain high quality fluorescent
multi-labeling.

A history of limited, intermittent intake of palatable food (sucrose drink)
attenuates hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis stress responses and induces
markers of neuronal plasticity in stress- and reward-regulatory brain regions.
Synaptic plasticity could provide a mechanism for long-term changes in neuronal
function, implying that sucrose stress-dampening may endure over long periods of 
time. The present study tests the persistence of HPA axis dampening and
plasticity after cessation of palatable drinking. Adult, male Long-Evans rats
(n=10-13) with free access to water and chow were given additional twice-daily
access to 4ml sucrose (30%) or water for 14days. Rats were subsequently tested
for HPA responsiveness to an acute (20min) restraint stress at 1, 6 and 21days
after the cessation of sucrose. Brains were collected for immunohistochemical
analysis of FosB/deltaFosB, a marker of long-term neuronal plasticity, in the
basolateral amygdala (BLA) and nucleus accumbens (NuAc). Prior sucrose
consumption significantly decreased the plasma corticosterone response to
restraint at 1day after the last palatable drink presentation, and also increased
FosB/deltaFosB-positive cells in the BLA and in the NuAc core. This HPA-dampening
persisted through 21days after the termination of the palatable drink, as did the
increased FosB/deltaFosB immunoreactivity in both the BLA and the NuAc core.
These data suggest that chronic palatable food intake causes lasting changes in
stress/reward-modulatory circuitry and that the suppressed hormonal response to
stress that can persist well beyond periods of palatable drink exposure.

companion cumulus cells.

BACKGROUND: The bi-directional communication between the oocyte and its companion
cumulus cells (CCs) is crucial for development and functions of both cell types. 
Transcripts that are exclusively expressed either in oocytes or CCs and molecular
mechanisms affected due to removal of the communication axis between the two cell
types is not investigated at a larger scale. The main objectives of this study
were: 1. To identify transcripts exclusively expressed either in oocyte or CCs
and 2. To identify those which are differentially expressed when the oocyte is
cultured with or without its companion CCs and vice versa.
RESULTS: We analyzed transcriptome profile of different oocyte and CC samples
using Affymetrix GeneChip Bovine Genome array containing 23000 transcripts. Out
of 13162 genes detected in germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes and their companion CCs,
1516 and 2727 are exclusively expressed in oocytes and CCs, respectively, while
8919 are expressed in both. Similarly, of 13602 genes detected in metaphase II
(MII) oocytes and CCs, 1423 and 3100 are exclusively expressed in oocytes and
CCs, respectively, while 9079 are expressed in both. A total of 265 transcripts
are differentially expressed between oocytes cultured with (OO+CCs) and without
(OO-CCs) CCs, of which 217 and 48 are over expressed in the former and the later 
groups, respectively. Similarly, 566 transcripts are differentially expressed
when CCs mature with (CCs+OO) or without (CCs-OO) their enclosed oocytes. Of
these, 320 and 246 are over expressed in CCs+OO and CCs-OO, respectively.While
oocyte specific transcripts include those involved in transcription (IRF6,
POU5F1, MYF5, MED18), translation (EIF2AK1, EIF4ENIF1) and CCs specific ones
include those involved in carbohydrate metabolism (HYAL1, PFKL, PYGL, MPI),
protein metabolic processes (IHH, APOA1, PLOD1), steroid biosynthetic process
(APOA1, CYP11A1, HSD3B1, HSD3B7). Similarly, while transcripts over expressed in 
OO+CCs are involved in carbohydrate metabolism (ACO1, 2), molecular transport
(GAPDH, GFPT1) and nucleic acid metabolism (CBS, NOS2), those over expressed in
CCs+ OO are involved in cellular growth and proliferation (FOS, GADD45A), cell
cycle (HAS2, VEGFA), cellular development (AMD1, AURKA, DPP4) and gene expression
(FOSB, TGFB2).
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study has generated large scale gene expression
data from different oocyte and CCs samples that would provide insights into gene 
functions and interactions within and across different pathways that are involved
in the maturation of bovine oocytes. Moreover, the presence or absence of oocyte 
and CC factors during bovine oocyte maturation can have a profound effect on
transcript abundance of each cell types, thereby showing the prevailing molecular
cross-talk between oocytes and their corresponding CCs.

In spite of a large number of transforming growth factor ß1 (TGF-ß1)-regulated
genes, the nature of its targets with roles in transformation continues to be
poorly understood. Here, we discovered that TGF-ß1 stimulates transcription of
metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1), a dual master coregulator, in epithelial 
cells, and that MTA1 status is a determinant of TGF-ß1-induced
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes. In addition, we found that
MTA1/polymerase II/activator protein-1 (AP-1) co-activator complex interacts with
the FosB-gene chromatin and stimulates its transcription, and FosB in turn,
utilizes FosB/histone deacetylase 2 complex to repress E-cadherin expression in
TGF-ß1-stimulated mammary epithelial cells. These findings suggest that TGF-ß1
regulates the components of EMT via stimulating the expression of MTA1, which in 
turn, induces FosB to repress E-cadherin expression and thus, revealed an
inherent function of MTA1 as a target and effector of TGF-ß1 signaling in
epithelial cells.

multiple families of immediate early genes (IEGs) in the rat: normalization by an

RATIONALE: Repeated injections of cocaine cause blunted responses to acute
cocaine challenge-induced increases in the expression of immediate early genes
(IEGs).
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test if chronic methamphetamine (METH)
exposure might cause similar blunting of acute METH-induced increases in IEG
expression.
RESULTS: Repeated saline or METH injections were given to rats over 14 days.
After 1 day of withdrawal, they received a single injection of saline or METH (5 
mg/kg). Acute injection of METH increased c-fos, fosB, fra2, junB, Egr1-3, Nr4a1 
(Nur77), and Nr4a3 (Nor-1) mRNA levels in the striatum of saline-pretreated rats.
Chronic METH treatment alone reduced the expression of AP1, Erg1-3, and Nr4a1
transcription factors below control levels. Acute METH challenge normalized these
values in METH-pretreated rats. Unexpectedly, acute METH challenge to
METH-pretreated animals caused further decreases in Nr4a2 (Nurr1) mRNA levels. In
contrast, the METH challenge caused significant but blunted increases in Nr4a3
and Arc expression in METH-pretreated rats. There were also chronic
METH-associated decreases in the expression of cAMP responsive element binding
protein (CREB) which modulates IEG expression via activation of the cAMP/PKA/CREB
signal transduction pathway. Chronic METH exposure also caused significant
decreases in preprotachykinin, but not in prodynorphin, mRNA levels.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support the accumulated evidence that chronic
administration of psychostimulants is associated with blunting of their acute
stimulatory effects on IEG expression. The METH-induced renormalization of the
expression of several IEGs in rats chronically exposed to METH hints to a
potential molecular explanation for the recurrent self-administration of the drug
by human addicts.

Cadmium induces phosphorylation and stabilization of c-Fos in HK-2 renal proximal
tubular cells.

We examined the effects of cadmium chloride (CdCl2) exposure on the expression
and phosphorylation status of members of the Fos family, components of the
activator protein-1 transcription factor, in HK-2 human renal proximal tubular
cells. Following the exposure to CdCl2, the expression of c-fos, fosB, fra-1, and
fra-2 increased markedly, with different magnitudes and time courses. The levels 
of Fos family proteins (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2) also increased in response
to CdCl2 exposure. Although the elevation of c-fos transcripts was transient,
c-Fos protein levels increased progressively with lower electrophoretic mobility,
suggesting stabilization of c-Fos through post-translational modifications.
Consistently, we observed phosphorylation of c-Fos at Ser362 and Ser374 in HK-2
cells treated with CdCl2. Phosphorylated forms of mitogen-activated protein
kinases (MAPKs)-including extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK),
c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and p38-increased after CdCl2 exposure, whereas
treatment with the MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor U0126 and the p38 inhibitor SB203580
suppressed the accumulation and phosphorylation of c-Fos. We mutated Ser362 to
alanine (S362A), Ser374 to alanine (S374A), and both residues to alanines
(S362A/S374A) to inhibit potential phosphorylation of c-Fos at these sites. S374A
or double S362A/S374A mutations reduced c-Fos level markedly, but S362A mutation 
did not. On the other hand, S362A/S374A mutations induced a more pronounced
reduction in c-Fos DNA-binding activity than S374A mutation. These results
suggest that while Ser374 phosphorylation seems to play a role in c-Fos
stabilization, phosphorylation at two C-terminal serine residues is required for 
the transcriptional activation of c-Fos in HK-2 cells treated with CdCl2.

Putaminal upregulation of FosB/<U+0394>FosB-like immunoreactivity in Parkinson's disease
patients with dyskinesia.

The transcription factor <U+0394>FosB is a mediator of maladaptive neuroplasticity in
animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. Using an
antibody that recognizes all known isoforms of FosB and <U+0394>FosB, we have examined
the expression of these proteins in post-mortem basal ganglia sections from PD
patients. The patient cases were classified as being dyskinetic or non-dyskinetic
based on their clinical records. Sections from neurologically healthy controls
were also included in the study. Compared to both controls and non-dyskinetic
cases, the dyskinetic group showed a higher density of FosB/<U+0394>FosB-immunopositive 
cells in the posterior putamen, which represents the motor region of the striatum
in primates. In contrast, the number of FosB/<U+0394>FosB-positive cells did not differ 
significantly among the groups in the caudate, a region primarily involved with
the processing of cognitive and limbic-related information. Only sparse
FosB/<U+0394>FosB immunoreactivity was found in the in the pallidum externum and
internum, and no significant group differences were detected in these nuclei. The
putaminal elevation of FosB/<U+0394>FosB-like immunoreactivity in patients who had been 
affected by L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia is consistent with results from both rat
and non-human primate models of this movement disorder. The present findings
support the hypothesis of an involvement of <U+0394>FosB-related transcription factors
in the molecular mechanisms of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.

BN82451 attenuates L-dopa-induced dyskinesia in 6-OHDA-lesioned rat model of
Parkinson's disease.

The development of L-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) remains a major problem in the
long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to assess the
effect of the multitargeting molecule BN82451 on LID and to measure striatal mRNA
expression of several genes in a rat model of PD. Rats were administered two
unilateral injections of 6-OHDA in the striatum. After four weeks, the animals
started a chronic daily treatment with increasing doses of L-dopa over a further 
four-week period. Over the course of L-dopa treatment, the rats developed
abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) classified as locomotive, axial, orolingual
and forelimb dyskinesia. In animals rendered dyskinetic by L-dopa, administration
of BN82451 at doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg p.o. attenuated the severity of
fully-established AIMs in a dose-related manner. This anti-dyskinetic effect
could be achieved with lower doses of BN82451 administered sub chronically vs.
acute single treatment. The improvement of AIMs is not due to a reduction in the 
general motor activity of dyskinetic rats. BN82451 treatment significantly
reversed the overexpression of c-Fos, FosB and Arc mRNA associated with the
dyskinesiogenic action of L-dopa. A significant correlation between the degree of
overexpression of c-Fos, FosB and Arc mRNA and the dyskinesiogenic action of
L-dopa was observed. The data demonstrate that BN82451 effectively attenuates LID
and the associated molecular alterations in an animal model of PD and may
represent a treatment option for managing dyskinesia.

Pharmacological recruitment of the GABAergic tail of the ventral tegmental area
by acute drug exposure.

Barrot M.

Recherche Scientifique, Strasbourg, France.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The tail of the ventral tegmental area (tVTA), also
called the rostromedial tegmental nucleus, is a newly defined brain structure and
a potential control centre for dopaminergic activity. It was identified by the
induction of DeltaFosB following chronic cocaine exposure. In this work, we
screened 20 drugs for their ability to induce FosB/DeltaFosB in the tVTA.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Immunohistochemistry following systemic drug
administration was used to study FosB/DeltaFosB induction in the tVTA of adult
rats. Double-staining was used to determine whether dopamine or GABA neurones are
involved in this induction.
KEY RESULTS: The acute injection of the psychostimulant drugs cocaine,
D-amphetamine, (+/-)-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), methylphenidate or
caffeine, induced the expression of FosB/DeltaFosB in the tVTA GABAergic cells.
No induction was observed following exposure to ethanol, diazepam,
<U+03B3>-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), morphine, ketamine, phencyclidine (PCP),
<U+0394>(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), sodium valproic acid or gabapentin. To evaluate 
the role of monoamine transporters in the psychostimulant-induced expression of
FosB/DeltaFosB, we tested the antidepressant drugs reboxetine, nortriptyline,
fluoxetine and venlafaxine (which target the noradrenaline and/or the
5-hydroxytryptamine transporters), the 5-hydroxytryptamine releasing agent
dexfenfluramine, and the dopamine transporter inhibitor GBR12909. Only GBR12909
was able to induce FosB/DeltaFosB expression in the tVTA, showing that this
induction is mediated by dopamine.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Newly described brain structures may help to
increase our knowledge of brain function, pathology and targets for treatments.
FosB/DeltaFosB induction in the tVTA is a common feature of drugs sharing
psychostimulant properties but not of drugs sharing risk of abuse.

Long-term voluntary wheel running is rewarding and produces plasticity in the
mesolimbic reward pathway.

Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA. Ben.Greenwood@Colorado.edu

The mesolimbic reward pathway is implicated in stress-related psychiatric
disorders and is a potential target of plasticity underlying the stress
resistance produced by repeated voluntary exercise. It is unknown, however,
whether rats find long-term access to running wheels rewarding, or if repeated
voluntary exercise reward produces plastic changes in mesolimbic reward
neurocircuitry. In the current studies, young adult, male Fischer 344 rats
allowed voluntary access to running wheels for 6 weeks, but not 2 weeks, found
wheel running rewarding, as measured by conditioned place preference (CPP).
Consistent with prior reports and the behavioral data, 6 weeks of wheel running
increased <U+0394>FosB/FosB immunoreactivity in the nucleus accumbens (Acb). In
addition, semi quantitative in situ hybridization revealed that 6 weeks of wheel 
running, compared to sedentary housing, increased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA 
levels in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), increased delta opioid receptor (DOR)
mRNA levels in the Acb shell, and reduced levels of dopamine receptor (DR)-D2
mRNA in the Acb core. Results indicate that repeated voluntary exercise is
rewarding and alters gene transcription in mesolimbic reward neurocircuitry. The 
duration-dependent effects of wheel running on CPP suggest that as the weeks of
wheel running progress, the rewarding effects of a night of voluntary wheel
running might linger longer into the inactive cycle thus providing stronger
support for CPP. The observed plasticity could contribute to the mechanisms by
which exercise reduces the incidence and severity of substance abuse disorders,
changes the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse, and facilitates successful
coping with stress.

induction of DeltaFosB.

The molecular mechanisms underlying stress- and drug-induced neuronal adaptations
are incompletely understood. One molecule implicated in such adaptations is
<U+0394>FosB, a transcription factor that accumulates in the rodent nucleus accumbens
(NAc), a key brain reward region, in response to either chronic stress or
repeated exposure to drugs of abuse. The upstream transcriptional mechanisms
controlling <U+0394>FosB induction by these environmental stimuli remain elusive. Here, 
we identify the activity-dependent transcription factor, serum response factor
(SRF), as a novel upstream mediator of stress-, but not cocaine-, induced <U+0394>FosB. 
SRF is downregulated in NAc of both depressed human patients and in mice
chronically exposed to social defeat stress. This downregulation of SRF is absent
in resilient animals. Through the use of inducible mutagenesis, we show that
stress-mediated induction of <U+0394>FosB, which occurs predominantly in resilient mice,
is dependent on SRF expression in this brain region. Furthermore, NAc-specific
genetic deletion of SRF promotes a variety of prodepressant- and proanxiety-like 
phenotypes and renders animals more sensitive to the deleterious effects of
chronic stress. In contrast, we demonstrate that SRF does not play a role in
<U+0394>FosB accumulation in NAc in response to chronic cocaine exposure. Furthermore,
NAc-specific knock-out of SRF has no effect on cocaine-induced behaviors,
indicating that chronic social defeat stress and repeated cocaine exposure
regulate <U+0394>FosB accumulation and behavioral sensitivity through independent
mechanisms.

Association between striatal accumulation of FosB/<U+0394>FosB and long-term psychomotor
sensitization to amphetamine in mice depends on the genetic background.

Previous results demonstrated association between increased FosB/<U+0394>FosB
immunostaining in the ventromedial striatum and behavioral sensitization to
amphetamine promoted by repeated stress or by repeated pairings of the
psychostimulant and the testing cage in mice of the C57BL/6J strain. The present 
experiments tested this association in an additional protocol, its stability
following the end of the sensitizing procedure and its generalization to mice
from a different inbred strain. Eleven days after repeated administration of
amphetamine within their home-cages, mice of the C57BL/6J strain expressed
sensitization to the psychomotor effects of the psychostimulant when tested in a 
novel cage. At this time-point the same mice showed increased FosB/<U+0394>FosB
immunostaining in the ventromedial striatum. Instead, mice of the genetically
unrelated DBA/2J inbred strain expressing robust sensitization in the same
protocol did not show changes in FosB/<U+0394>FosB immunostaining throughout the
striatal complex. Lack of effects in FosB/<U+0394>FosB immunostaining was also observed 
in DBA/2J mice behaviorally sensitized by repeated pairings of amphetamine with
the test cage. These results demonstrate that mice, depending on the genetic
background, can develop robust and long-lasting behavioral sensitization to
amphetamine in the absence of striatal <U+0394>FosB accumulation.

Transcription regulatory genes are crucial modulators of cell physiology and
metabolism whose intracellular levels are tightly controlled in response to
extracellular stimuli. We previously reported a set of 29 transcription
regulatory genes modulated by angiotensin II in H295R human adrenocortical cells 
and their roles in regulating the expression of the last and unique enzymes of
the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid biosynthetic pathways, 11ß-hydroxylase
and aldosterone synthase, respectively, using gene expression reporter assays. To
study the effect of this set of transcription regulatory genes on adrenal
steroidogenesis, H295R cells were transfected by high-efficiency nucleofection
and aldosterone and cortisol were measured in cell culture supernatants under
basal and angiotensin II-stimulated conditions. BCL11B, BHLHB2, CITED2, ELL2,
HMGA1, MAFF, NFIL3, PER1, SERTAD1, and VDR significantly stimulated aldosterone
secretion, while EGR1, FOSB, and ZFP295 decreased aldosterone secretion. BTG2,
HMGA1, MITF, NR4A1, and ZFP295 significantly increased cortisol secretion, while 
BCL11B, NFIL3, PER1, and SIX2 decreased cortisol secretion. We also report the
effect of some of these regulators on the expression of endogenous aldosterone
synthase and 11ß-hydroxylase under basal and angiotensin II-stimulated
conditions. In summary, this study reports for the first time the effects of a
set of angiotensin II-modulated transcription regulatory genes on aldosterone and
cortisol secretion and the expression levels of the last and unique enzymes of
the mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid biosynthetic pathways. Abnormal
regulation of mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid secretion is involved in
several pathophysiological conditions. These transcription regulatory genes may
be involved in adrenal steroidogenesis pathologies; thus they merit additional
study as potential candidates for therapeutic intervention.

Reactive oxygen species are the cause of the enhanced cardiorespiratory response

This study was carried out to investigate the role of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) in the elevation of cardiorespiratory responses during the development of
intermittent hypoxia (IH)-induced hypertension. Rats were exposed to either 30
days of IH [(30s N2)+(45 s room air (RA)] or RA for 6 h/day. After 5 days of
exposure, stable mean arterial pressure, normalized low-frequency power of pulses
interval spectrogram (a marker of cardiac sympathetic outflow), and minute
ventilation (an index for arterial chemoreflex activation) were significantly
increased throughout the observation period in IH-exposed rats, but not in
RA-exposed rats. FosB expression in rostral ventrolateral medulla was elevated
after IH exposure for 5 days. Intraperitoneal injection of MnTMPyP (a superoxide 
scavenger) or N-acetylcysteine (an antioxidant) prevented IH-induced elevation of
the cardiorespiratory responses and lipid peroxidation of lung tissues. These
results suggest that ROS are essential for IH-induced elevation of arterial
chemoreflex activation and sympathetic outflow, which may, in turn, contribute to
IH-induced hypertension.

Cholesterol depletion enhances adrenergic signaling in cardiac myocytes.

Cardiac myocytes endogenously express a and ß adrenergic receptors, prototypes of
the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily. Depending upon the dose of
norepinephrine (agonist) exposure, hypertrophy and apoptosis are initiated by
differential induction of two discrete constituents of the transcription factor
AP-1, i.e., FosB and Fra-1. We explored differential adrenergic signaling as a
paradigm for understanding how cholesterol dictates cells to choose hypertrophy
or apoptosis. For this, we used fosB and fra-1 promoter-reporter constructs for
monitoring adrenergic signaling. We show that cholesterol depletion enhances
norepinephrine-mediated signaling in cardiac myocytes. Importantly, this
increased signaling is reduced to original level upon cholesterol replenishment. 
We used specific ligands for a and ß adrenergic receptors and show that the
enhanced signaling upon cholesterol depletion is a combined effect of both a and 
ß adrenergic receptors. These results constitute the first report demonstrating
the effect of cholesterol on adrenergic signaling using a direct end-point gene
expression.

Wnt/ß-catenin signaling enhances osteoblastogenic differentiation from human
periodontal ligament fibroblasts.

Biology, School of Dentistry, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, 130-701, Korea.

Wnt/ß-catenin signaling has been known to influence bone formation and
homeostasis. In this study, we investigated the canonical Wnt signaling
regulation of osteogenic differentiation from periodontal ligament (PDL)
fibroblasts. Stimulating PDL fibroblasts with lithium chloride (LiCl), a
canonical Wnt activator, significantly increased mineralized nodule and alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP) activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner. LiCl
up-regulated protein expression of osteogenic transcription factors, including
the runt-related gene 2, Msx2, and Osterix 2, in the PDL fibroblasts. Treatment
of these cells with LiCl also increased the mRNA levels of ALP, FosB, and Fra1 in
a dose-dependent manner. Blockage of canonical Wnt signaling by treating the
cells with DKK1 inhibited Wnt1-stimulated mRNA expression of these osteogenic
factors. Furthermore, pretreatment with DKK1 reduced the ALP activity and matrix 
mineralization stimulated by Wnt1. Collectively, these results suggest that
canonical Wnt signaling leads to the differentiation of PDL fibroblasts into
osteogenic lineage with the attendant stimulation of osteogenic transcription
factors.

A growing number of studies indicate that chronic stress can accelerate tumor
growth due to sustained sympathetic nervous system activation. Our recent
findings suggest that chronic stress is associated with increased IL8 levels.
Here, we examined the molecular and biological significance of IL8 in
stress-induced tumor growth. Norepinephrine (NE) treatment of ovarian cancer
cells resulted in a 250-300% increase in IL8 protein and 240-320% increase in its
mRNA levels. Epinephrine treatment resulted in similar increases. Moreover, NE
treatment resulted in a 3.5-4-fold increase in IL8 promoter activity. These
effects were blocked by propranolol. Promoter deletion analyses suggested that
AP1 transcription factors might mediate catecholamine-stimulated up-regulation of
IL8. siRNA inhibition studies identified FosB as the pivotal component
responsible for IL8 regulation by NE. In vivo chronic stress resulted in
increased tumor growth (by 221 and 235%; p < 0.01) in orthotopic xenograft models
involving SKOV3ip1 and HeyA8 ovarian carcinoma cells. This enhanced tumor growth 
was completely blocked by IL8 or FosB gene silencing using
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine nanoliposomes. IL8 and FosB
silencing reduced microvessel density (based on CD31 staining) by 2.5- and
3.5-fold, respectively (p < 0.001). Our findings indicate that neurobehavioral
stress leads to FosB-driven increases in IL8, which is associated with increased 
tumor growth and metastases. These findings may have implications for ovarian
cancer management.

AP1 factor inactivation in the suprabasal epidermis causes increased epidermal
hyperproliferation and hyperkeratosis but reduced carcinogen-dependent tumor
formation.

Activator protein one (AP1) (jun/fos) factors comprise a family of
transcriptional regulators (c-jun, junB, junD, c-fos, FosB, Fra-1 and Fra-2) that
are key controllers of epidermal keratinocyte survival and differentiation, and
are important drivers of cancer development. Understanding the role of these
factors in epidermis is complicated by the fact that each member is expressed in 
defined cell layers during epidermal differentiation, and because AP1 factors
regulate competing processes (that is, proliferation, apoptosis and
differentiation). We have proposed that AP1 factors function differently in basal
versus suprabasal epidermis. To test this, we inactivated suprabasal AP1 factor
function in mouse epidermis by targeted expression of dominant-negative c-jun
(TAM67), which inactivates function of all AP1 factors. This produces increased
basal keratinocyte proliferation, delayed differentiation and extensive
hyperkeratosis. These findings contrast with previous studies showing that basal 
layer AP1 factor inactivation does not perturb resting epidermis. It is
interesting that in spite of extensive keratinocyte hyperproliferation,
susceptibility to carcinogen-dependent tumor induction is markedly attenuated.
These novel observations strongly suggest that AP1 factors have distinct roles in
the basal versus suprabasal epidermis, confirm that AP1 factor function is
required for normal terminal differentiation, and suggest that AP1 factors have a
different role in normal epidermis versus cancer progression.

Activation of the transcription factor FosB/activating protein-1 (AP-1) is a
prominent downstream signal of the extracellular nucleotide receptor P2RX7 in
monocytic and osteoblastic cells.

Activation of the ionotropic P2RX7 nucleotide receptor by extracellular ATP has
been implicated in modulating inflammatory disease progression. Continuous
exposure of P2RX7 to ligand can result in apoptosis in many cell types, including
monocytic cells, whereas transient activation of P2RX7 is linked to inflammatory 
mediator production and the promotion of cell growth. Given the rapid hydrolysis 
of ATP in the circulation and interstitial space, transient activation of P2RX7
appears critically important for its action, yet its effects on gene expression
are unclear. The present study demonstrates that short-term stimulation of human 
and mouse monocytic cells as well as mouse osteoblasts with P2RX7 agonists
substantially induces the expression of several activating protein-1 (AP-1)
members, particularly FosB. The potent activation of FosB after P2RX7 stimulation
is especially noteworthy considering that little is known concerning the role of 
FosB in immunological regulation. Interestingly, the magnitude of FosB activation
induced by P2RX7 stimulation appears greater than that observed with other known 
inducers of FosB expression. In addition, we have identified a previously
unrecognized role for FosB in osteoblasts with respect to nucleotide-induced
expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in
prostaglandin biosynthesis from arachidonic acid and is critical for osteoblastic
differentiation and immune behavior. The present studies are the first to link
P2RX7 action to FosB/AP-1 regulation in multiple cell types, including a role in 
nucleotide-induced COX-2 expression, and support a role for FosB in the control
of immune and osteogenic function by P2RX7.

Effect of decreasing intraluteal progesterone on sensitivity of the early porcine
corpus luteum to the luteolytic actions of prostaglandin F2alpha.

Prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF) causes luteolysis of the pig corpus luteum (CL) only 
after Day 12 of the estrous cycle. Recent evidence indicates that progesterone
(P4) may protect the CL from cell death. The present study tested the hypothesis 
that acute inhibition of P4 by treatment with epostane (EPO; 3betaHSD inhibitor) 
in CL lacking luteolytic capacity (Day 9 CL) will allow PGF to induce responses
associated with luteolysis. Multiple PGF-induced responses were evaluated,
including genes involved in production of PGF and estradiol-17beta, apoptosis
(caspase 3), and transcription (FOSB). These responses are associated with
PGF-induced luteolysis and do not normally occur in CL lacking luteolytic
capacity. Animals on Day 7 after estrus were divided into four groups: 1) control
(C), 2) PGF, 3) EPO, and 4) PGF plus EPO (PGF+EPO). Treatment with EPO (10 mg/kg)
or vehicle was given every 12 h for 36 h. Treatment with PGF (25 mg) or vehicle
was given at 38 h, and CL were collected from all animals at 48 h. Some CL from
each animal were frozen in liquid nitrogen for mRNA and protein analysis.
Remaining CL were incubated in media for 2 h for determination of P4 and PGF
production. EPO dramatically decreased production of P4 by luteal tissue (ng/mg
tissue) by 90% and 95% in EPO and PGF+EPO groups, respectively, compared to C (P 
< 0.01). Low production of PGF by luteal tissue was found in C, PGF, and EPO
groups; however, treatment with PGF+EPO dramatically increased (782%) luteal PGF 
production. Similar to intraluteal PGF production, increased mRNA for
cyclooxygenase 2 (PTGS2) and phospholipase A2 (group IB; PLA2G1B) was found in
the PGF+EPO, but not in the EPO or PGF, group. Aromatase (CYP19A1) mRNA was not
induced by PGF or EPO; however, PGF+EPO caused a more than 40-fold increase in
CYP19A1 mRNA (P < 0.01). CASP3 mRNA was increased (P < 0.01) by EPO (3.4-fold)
and by PGF (2.7-fold) but was most dramatically increased by PGF+EPO (5.3-fold), 
whereas caspase activity was only increased by PGF (1.5-fold) or PGF+EPO
(2.2-fold). Thus, these data support the hypothesis that elimination of the
protective effect of intraluteal P4 does not directly cause luteolysis of the
early CL but allows PGF to induce luteolytic responses in CL lacking luteolytic
capacity.

DNA methylation regulates cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization in mice.

Anier K(1), Malinovskaja K, Aonurm-Helm A, Zharkovsky A, Kalda A.

Author information:

The behavioral sensitization produced by repeated cocaine treatment represents
the neural adaptations underlying some of the features of addiction in humans.
Cocaine administrations induce neural adaptations through regulation of gene
expression. Several studies suggest that epigenetic modifications, including DNA 
methylation, are the critical regulators of gene expression in the adult central 
nervous system. DNA methylation is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)
and consequent promoter region hypermethylation is associated with
transcriptional silencing. In this study a potential role for DNA methylation in 
a cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization model in mice was explored. We report 
that acute cocaine treatment caused an upregulation of DNMT3A and DNMT3B gene
expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Using methylated DNA
immunoprecipitation, DNA bisulfite modification, and chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays, we observed that cocaine treatment resulted in DNA
hypermethylation and increased binding of methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) at
the protein phosphatase-1 catalytic subunit (PP1c) promoter. These changes are
associated with transcriptional downregulation of PP1c in NAc. In contrast, acute
and repeated cocaine administrations induced hypomethylation and decreased
binding of MeCP2 at the fosB promoter, and these are associated with
transcriptional upregulation of fosB in NAc. We also found that pharmacological
inhibition of DNMT by zebularine treatment decreased cocaine-induced DNA
hypermethylation at the PP1c promoter and attenuated PP1c mRNA downregulation in 
NAc. Finally, zebularine and cocaine co-treatment delayed the development of
cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization. Together, these results suggest that
dynamic changes of DNA methylation may be an important gene regulation mechanism 
underlying cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization.

Bacillithiol, a new player in bacterial redox homeostasis.

Helmann JD(1).

Author information:

USA. jdh9@cornell.edu

Bacillithiol (BSH), the a-anomeric glycoside of l-cysteinyl-d-glucosamine with
l-malic acid, plays a dominant role in the cytosolic thiol redox chemistry of the
low guanine and cytosine (GC) Gram-positive bacteria (phylum Firmicutes). BSH is 
functionally analogous to glutathione (GSH) but differs sufficiently in chemical 
structure that cells have evolved a distinct set of enzymes that use BSH as
cofactor. BSH was discovered in Bacillus subtilis as a mixed disulfide with the
redox-sensing repressor OhrR and in B. anthracis by biochemical analysis of pools
of labeled thiols. The structure of BSH was determined after purification from
Deinococcus radiodurans. Similarities in structure between BSH and mycothiol
(MSH) facilitated the identification of biosynthetic genes for BSH in the model
organism B. subtilis. Phylogenomic analyses have identified several candidate
BSH-using or associated proteins, including a BSH reductase, glutaredoxin-like
thiol-dependent oxidoreductases (bacilliredoxins), and a BSH-S-transferase (FosB)
involved in resistance to the epoxide antibiotic fosfomycin. Preliminary results 
implicate BSH in cellular processes to maintain cytosolic redox balance and for
adaptation to reactive oxygen, nitrogen, and electrophilic species. BSH also is
predicted to chelate metals avidly, in part due to the appended malate moiety,
although the implications of BSH for metal ion homeostasis have yet to be
explored in detail.

The schizophrenia susceptibility gene neuregulin 1 modulates tolerance to the
effects of cannabinoids.

Cannabis increases the risk of schizophrenia in genetically vulnerable
individuals. In this study we aim to show that the schizophrenia susceptibility
gene neuregulin 1 (Nrg1) modulates the development of tolerance to cannabinoids
in mice. Nrg1 heterozygous (HET) and wild-type (WT) mice were treated daily for
15 d with the synthetic analogue of <U+0394>9-tetrahydrocannabinol, CP55,940 (0.4
mg/kg). We measured the impact of this exposure on locomotor activity, anxiety,
prepulse inhibition (PPI), body temperature and FosB/<U+0394>FosB immunohistochemistry. 
Tolerance to CP55,940-induced hypothermia and locomotor suppression developed
more rapidly in Nrg1 HET mice than WT mice. Conversely in the light-dark test,
while tolerance to the anxiogenic effect of CP55,940 developed in WT mice over
days of testing, Nrg1 hypomorphs maintained marked anxiety even after 15 d of
treatment. Repeated cannabinoid exposure selectively increased FosB/<U+0394>FosB
expression in the lateral septum, ventral part (LSV) of Nrg1 HET but not WT mice.
On day 1 of exposure opposite effects of CP55,940 treatment were observed on PPI,
i.e. it was facilitated in Nrg1 hypomorphs and impaired in WT mice, despite the
drug significantly impairing the acoustic startle reflex equally in both
genotypes. These effects of CP55,940 on PPI were not maintained as both genotypes
became tolerant to cannabinoid action with repeated exposure. Our results
highlight that Nrg1 modulates the development of cannabinoid tolerance dependent 
on the parameter being measured. Furthermore, these data reinforce the notion
that the VLS is an important brain region involved in Nrg1-cannabinoid
interactions.

Regular bouts of physical activity may cause changes in gene expression that
accumulate over time and ultimately affect phenotypes, such as body weight, blood
lipid profile and tumour development. Furthermore, acute activity may affect gene
expression and phenotypes differently depending on whether the individual is
regularly inactive or active. One-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 72)
were equally divided into SED (standard laboratory cage, n = 24), PA (large
activity box, n = 24) and EX groups (exercise wheel inside standard cage, n =
24). At 3 months of age, half the animals from each group were killed at rest and
the other half following 30 min of physical activity. The RNA was extracted from 
cardiac tissue, and microarray analysis was performed on 27,000 genes. Select
gene results were validated using quantitative PCR. No gene expression
differences occurred when comparing all 3-month-old groups at rest. A relatively 
small percentage of genes (1.9%) were differentially expressed (P < 0.05)
following acute swimming activity in all groups, but only 37 unique and
identifiable genes reached or exceeded twofold differences in expression. The
genes Atf3, Fos, Apold1 and Pxdn were expressed differently among SED, PA and EX 
following acute activity, with a clear separation of the magnitude in gene
expression with SED > PA > EX. Differences in gene expression levels in young
physically inactive and active animals following acute activity have different
regulatory roles in gene networks that affect health-related phenotypes.

Chronic drug exposure induces alterations in gene expression profiles that are
thought to underlie the development of drug addiction. The present study examined
regulation of the Fos-family of transcription factors, specifically cFos, FosB,
and <U+0394>FosB, in striatal subregions during and after chronic intravenous cocaine
administration in self-administering and yoked rats. We found that cFos, FosB,
and <U+0394>FosB exhibit regionally and temporally distinct expression patterns, with
greater accumulation of <U+0394>FosB protein in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell and
core after chronic cocaine administration, whereas <U+0394>FosB increases in the
caudate-putamen (CPu) remained similar with either acute or chronic
administration. In contrast, tolerance developed to cocaine-induced mRNA for
<U+0394>FosB in all three striatal subregions with chronic administration. Tolerance
also developed to FosB expression, most notably in the NAc shell and CPu.
Interestingly, tolerance to cocaine-induced cFos induction was dependent on
volitional control of cocaine intake in ventral but not dorsal striatal regions, 
whereas regulation of FosB and <U+0394>FosB was similar in cocaine self-administering
and yoked animals. Thus, <U+0394>FosB-mediated neuroadaptations in the CPu may occur
earlier than previously thought with the initiation of intravenous cocaine use
and, together with greater accumulation of <U+0394>FosB in the NAc, could contribute to 
addiction-related increases in cocaine-seeking behavior.

Region-specific induction of FosB/<U+0394>FosB by voluntary alcohol intake: effects of
naltrexone.

Jersey, New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey 07103, USA.

BACKGROUND: <U+0394>FosB is the best characterized transcription factor induced by
chronic stimulation. Although previous studies have demonstrated that chronic
passive ethanol exposure alters <U+0394>FosB immunoreactivity (IR), the effect of
chronic voluntary ethanol consumption on <U+0394>FosB remains unknown. Furthermore,
although previous studies have demonstrated that the opioid antagonist naltrexone
reduces alcohol consumption in clinical and preclinical settings, the effect of
naltrexone on FosB/<U+0394>FosB has not been explored. Here, we examined the effects of 
chronic voluntary ethanol intake and naltrexone on FosB/<U+0394>FosB IR in striatal
region and prefrontal cortex, and the effect of naltrexone on voluntary ethanol
intake.
METHODS: We utilized immunohistochemistry to define the changes in FosB/<U+0394>FosB IR 
induced by chronic voluntary ethanol intake under a two-bottle intermittent
access of 20% ethanol model and by systematic administration (intraperitoneal
injection) of naltrexone in Sprague-Dawley rats.
RESULTS: Chronic (15 drinking sessions in 35 days) voluntary ethanol intake
robustly induces FosB/<U+0394>FosB IR in nucleus accumbens core, dorsolateral striatum, 
and orbitofrontal cortex, but not in nucleus accumbens shell, dorsomedial
striatum, and medial prefrontal cortex. Systemic administration of naltrexone for
6 days significantly reduced voluntary ethanol consumption and FosB/<U+0394>FosB IR
induced by chronic voluntary ethanol intake.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that chronic voluntary ethanol intake induces
FosB/<U+0394>FosB IR in a subregion-specific manner which involves the activation of
endogenous opioid system.

Sexual behavior in male rats is rewarding and reinforcing. However, little is
known about the specific cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating sexual
reward or the reinforcing effects of reward on subsequent expression of sexual
behavior. This study tests the hypothesis that <U+0394>FosB, the stably expressed
truncated form of FosB, plays a critical role in the reinforcement of sexual
behavior and experience-induced facilitation of sexual motivation and
performance. Sexual experience was shown to cause <U+0394>FosB accumulation in several
limbic brain regions including the nucleus accumbens (NAc), medial prefrontal
cortex, ventral tegmental area and caudate putamen but not the medial preoptic
nucleus. Next, the induction of c-Fos, a downstream (repressed) target of <U+0394>FosB, 
was measured in sexually experienced and naïve animals. The number of
mating-induced c-Fos-immunoreactive cells was significantly decreased in sexually
experienced animals compared with sexually naïve controls. Finally, <U+0394>FosB levels 
and its activity in the NAc were manipulated using viral-mediated gene transfer
to study its potential role in mediating sexual experience and experience-induced
facilitation of sexual performance. Animals with <U+0394>FosB overexpression displayed
enhanced facilitation of sexual performance with sexual experience relative to
controls. In contrast, the expression of <U+0394>JunD, a dominant negative binding
partner of <U+0394>FosB, attenuated sexual experience-induced facilitation of sexual
performance and stunted long-term maintenance of facilitation compared to green
fluorescence protein and <U+0394>FosB overexpressing groups. Together, these findings
support a critical role for <U+0394>FosB expression in the NAc for the reinforcing
effects of sexual behavior and sexual experience-induced facilitation of sexual
performance.

Presynaptic dopaminergic compartment determines the susceptibility to
L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in rats.

Science, Lund University, BMC D11, 22184 Lund, Sweden.

Drug-induced dyskinesias in dopamine-denervated animals are known to depend on
both pre- and postsynaptic changes of the nigrostriatal circuitry. In lesion
models used thus far, changes occur in both of these compartments and, therefore,
it has not been possible to dissect the individual contribution of each
compartment in the pathophysiology of dyskinesias. Here we silenced the
nigrostriatal dopamine neurotransmission without affecting the anatomical
integrity of the presynaptic terminals using a short-hairpin RNA-mediated
knockdown of tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme (shTH). This treatment resulted in
significant reduction (by about 70%) in extracellular dopamine concentration in
the striatum as measured by on-line microdialysis. Under these conditions, the
animals remained nondyskinetic after chronic L-DOPA treatment, whereas partial
intrastriatal 6-hydoxydopamine lesioned rats with comparable reduction in
extracellular dopamine levels developed dyskinesias. On the other hand,
apomorphine caused moderate to severe dyskinesias in both groups. Importantly,
single-dose L-DOPA challenge in apomorphine-primed shTH animals failed to
activate the already established abnormal postsynaptic responses. Taken together,
these data provide direct evidence that the status of the presynaptic, DA
releasing compartment is a critical determinant of both the induction and
maintenance of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias.

Chronic low dose Adderall XR down-regulates cfos expression in infantile and
prepubertal rat striatum and cortex.

Scotia, Canada.

We previously reported that treatment of prepubertal male rats with low, injected
or oral, doses of methylphenidate stimulated cfos, fosB and arc expression in
many areas of the developing brain. In the present study our objective was to
determine whether the widely prescribed psychostimulant Adderall XR (ADD) exerted
similar effects in infantile and prepubertal rat brain. We report here, for the
first time, that low threshold doses of oral ADD, an extended-release mixture of 
amphetamine salts, now routinely used for the treatment of Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), also increased cfos expression in infantile
(postnatal day 10; PD10) and prepubertal (PD24) rat brain. These threshold doses 
were correlated with blood levels of amphetamine determined by liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry. Moreover, we observed that chronic treatment
with oral ADD (1.6 mg/kg; x 14 days) not only significantly down-regulated cfos
expression following a final challenge dose of ADD in prepubertal (PD24) rat
striatum and cortex, quantified in terms of FOS immunoreactivity (FOS-ir), but
did so at a daily dose that was without effect with methylphenidate (MPH); that
is a much higher oral dose of MPH (7.5 mg/kg; x 14 days) failed to induce
down-regulation of cfos expression. Similar experiments in infantile rats (PD10),
but using a threshold injected dose of ADD (1.25 mg/kg sc) also significantly
reduced striatal and cingulate cortical FOS-ir. An additional finding in the
prepubertal rats was that oral ADD-induced FOS-ir was observed in the cerebral
cortex following doses lower than the threshold dose necessary to increase FOS-ir
in the striatum. This was not the case in the PD10 rats. In conclusion, our
efforts to calibrate biological responses, such as immediate early gene
expression, to clinically relevant blood levels of stimulants confirmed that
expression of cfos is very sensitive to repeated low doses of Adderall XR. It is 
now feasible to examine whether other genes are also affected in these young rats
and if the changes we report are reversible. The implications of such studies
should be relevant to the putative effects of psychostimulant treatment of very
young children.

To reveal neuroendocrine/neurochemical changes that are responsible for the
robust metabolic alterations seen during chronic morphine treatment we followed
hormonal-, transcriptional- and behavioral changes during chronic morphine
administration in adult male Wistar rats. Animals were implanted with increasing 
amount of slow release morphine tablets for 8 days. Morphine treated animals gain
significantly less weight than placebo implanted controls. This weight loss is
due to the dramatic decrease in the food intake and caloric efficiency in the
first days of drug administration and to the lasting disregulated feeding
pattern. Changes in feeding behavior included increase of diurnal and decrease of
nocturnal feeding frequency in morphine treated rats. Significantly less leptin
and insulin plasma levels were detected in morphine implanted animals than in
placebo implanted controls, while adiponectin and ACTH concentration remain
unchanged. Morphine treated rats display an increase of FosB/Delta FosB
immunoreactivity at brain sites that have been implicated regulation of food
intake and energy expenditure, including hypothalamic arcuate, paraventricular
and ventromedial nuclei and in the lateral hypothalamic area as well as in the
caudal brainstem. However, morphine-induced long-term metabolic alterations were 
not accompanied with any significant changes in the expression of anorexigenic
neuropeptides POMC and CART in the hypothalamus and in the brainstem. The
disregulated feeding pattern was not reflected in changes of orexin
transcription, however, a compensatory upregulation was revealed in hypothalamic 
NPY expression.

Lymph node (LN) metastasis is one of the most important adverse prognostic
factors for pancreatic cancer. The aim of this study was to identify novel
lymphatic metastasis-associated markers for pancreatic cancer. DNA microarray
analysis was used to determine and compare the expression profiles of 17
pancreatic cancer tissues with LN metastasis and 17 pancreatic cancer tissues
without LN metastasis. The microarray results were validated by real-time reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Only 58 genes
were differentially expressed between the two groups with a difference in signal 
intensity ratio greater than a 1.5-fold change. Of these genes, 30 were
significantly down-regulated in the LN metastasis group. Among five selected
down-regulated genes for validation using real-time PCR, the expression of DST,
FosB, RGS16, and CXCL12 was significantly lower in the LN metastasis group.
Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed RGS16 and FosB underexpression in
pancreatic cancer tissues with LN metastasis. RGS16 and FosB underexpression was 
associated with poor patient survival. Our findings show that RGS16 and FosB are 
underexpressed in pancreatic cancer with lymph node metastasis and associated
with reduced survival, suggesting that RGS16 and FosB might be prognostic markers
for pancreatic cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate gene expression signatures of breast tissue in
female-to-male (FtM) transsexuals under cross-sex hormone therapy (HT).
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Academic research institution.
PATIENT(S): Five hormone-naïve FtM transsexuals before and after HT.
INTERVENTION(S): Breast tissue biopsy before and after 2 years of intramuscular
testosterone undecanoate (1,000 mg every 12 wk) and oral lynestrenole (5 mg
daily), and gene signature analysis by global gene expression array covering
28,869 genes.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Differential regulation of specific genes and gene
expression signatures.
RESULT(S): We identified 2,250 differentially expressed probe sets. One hundred
twenty probe sets showed >2-fold change, of which 77 (64.2%) were up-regulated
and 43 (35.8%) down-regulated. Genes involved in transcription were most
overrepresented, with 43 out of 97 (44.3%) annotated probes, e.g., the
transcription factor complex activator protein 1, including all three Jun genes
(c-Jun, JunB, and JunD), two Fos genes (c-Fos and FosB), and activating
transcription factor 3. In a Database for Annotation, Visualization, and
Integrated Discovery analysis of the 2,007 down-regulated probe sets, proteins of
the ribosome pathway and of two pathways involved in protein degradation, i.e.,
proteasome- and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, were significantly
down-regulated. We identified eight breast cancer-associated gene expression
signatures significantly overlapping with differentially regulated probe sets
after cross-sex HT.
CONCLUSION(S): Cross-sex HT in FtM transsexuals leads to the up-regulation and
down-regulation of 243 and 2,007 distinct genes, respectively, and is associated 
with breast cancer-related gene expression signatures.

Repeated social defeat selectively increases dFosB expression and histone H3
acetylation in the infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex.

Exposure to social stress has been linked to the development and maintenance of
mood-related psychopathology; however, the underlying neurobiological changes
remain uncertain. In this study, we examined numbers of dFosB-immunoreactive
cells in the forebrains of rats subjected to 12 episodes of social defeat. This
was achieved using the social conflict model whereby animals are introduced into 
the home cage of older males ("residents") trained to attack and defeat all such 
"intruders"; importantly, controls were treated identically except that the
resident was absent. Our results indicated that the only region in which
dFosB-positive cells were found in significantly higher numbers in intruders than
in controls was the infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). This same effect
was not apparent using another psychological stressor, noise stress. Cells of the
infralimbic mPFC also displayed evidence of chromatin remodeling. We found that
exposure to repeated episodes of social defeat increased numbers of cells
immunoreactive for histone H3 acetylation, but not for histone H3
phosphoacetylation, in the infralimbic mPFC. Collectively, these findings
highlight the importance of the infralimbic mPFC in responding to social stress-a
finding that provides insight into the possible neurobiological alterations
associated with stress-induced psychiatric illness.

Striatal overexpression of DeltaFosB reproduces chronic levodopa-induced
involuntary movements.

Long-term dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease leads to the
development of disabling involuntary movements named dyskinesias that are related
to adaptive changes in striatal signaling pathways. The chronic transcription
factor DeltaFosB, which is overexpressed in striatal neurons after chronic
dopaminergic drug exposure, is suspected to mediate these adaptive changes. Here,
we sought to demonstrate the ability of DeltaFosB to lead directly to the
abnormal motor responses associated with chronic dopaminergic therapy. Using rAAV
(recombinant adenoassociated virus) viral vectors, high levels of DeltaFosB
expression were induced in the striatum of dopamine-denervated rats naive of
chronic drug administration. Transgenic DeltaFosB overexpression reproduced the
entire spectrum of altered motor behaviors in response to acute levodopa tests,
including different types of abnormal involuntary movements and hypersensitivity 
of rotational responses that are typically associated with chronic levodopa
treatment. JunD, the usual protein partner of DeltaFosB binding to AP-1
(activator protein-1) sites of genes, remained unchanged in rats with high
DeltaFosB expression induced by viral vectors. These findings demonstrate that
the increase of striatal DeltaFosB in the evolution of chronically treated
Parkinson's disease may be a trigger for the development of abnormal
responsiveness to dopamine and the emergence of involuntary movements.

Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease, infects heart and
muscle cells leading to cardiac arrest, followed by death. The genetic
architectures in the early T. cruzi infection process of human cells are unknown.
To understand the genetic architectures of the early invasion process of T.
cruzi, we conducted gene transcription microarray analysis, followed by gene
network construction of the host cell response in primary human coronary artery
smooth muscle (HCASM) cells infected with T. cruzi or exposed to T. cruzi gp83, a
ligand used by the trypanosome to bind host cells. Using seven RT-PCR verified
up-regulated genes (FOSB, ATF5, INPP1, CCND2, THBS1, LAMC1, and APLP2) as the
seed for network construction, we built an interaction network of the early T.
cruzi infection process containing 165 genes, connected by 598 biological
interactions. This interactome network is centered on the BCL6 gene as a hub.
Silencing the expression of two seed genes (THBS1 and LAMC1) by RNAi reduced T.
cruzi infection. Overall, our results elucidate the significant and complex
process involved in T. cruzi infection of HCASM cells at the transcriptome level.
This is the first elucidation into the interactome network in human cells caused 
by T. cruzi and its gp83 ligand.

Inflammatory tissue destruction is central to pathology in CNS tuberculosis (TB).
We hypothesized that microglial-derived matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have a
key role in driving such damage. Analysis of all of the MMPs demonstrated that
conditioned medium from Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected human monocytes
(CoMTb) stimulated greater MMP-1, -3, and -9 gene expression in human microglial 
cells than direct infection. In patients with CNS TB, MMP-1/-3 immunoreactivity
was demonstrated in the center of brain granulomas. Concurrently, CoMTb decreased
expression of the inhibitors, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2, -3, and
-4. MMP-1/-3 secretion was significantly inhibited by dexamethasone, which
reduces mortality in CNS TB. Surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization
time-of-flight analysis of CoMTb showed that TNF-alpha and IL-1beta are necessary
but not sufficient for upregulating MMP-1 secretion and act synergistically to
drive MMP-3 secretion. Chemical inhibition and promoter-reporter analyses showed 
that NF-kappaB and AP-1 c-Jun/FosB heterodimers regulate CoMTb-induced MMP-1/-3
secretion. Furthermore, NF-kappaB p65 and AP-1 c-Jun subunits were upregulated in
biopsy granulomas from patients with cerebral TB. In summary, functionally
unopposed, network-dependent microglial MMP-1/-3 gene expression and secretion
regulated by NF-kappaB and AP-1 subunits were demonstrated in vitro and, for the 
first time, in CNS TB patients. Dexamethasone suppression of MMP-1/-3 gene
expression provides a novel mechanism explaining the benefit of steroid therapy
in these patients.

Ability of predator odour exposure to elicit conditioned versus sensitised post
traumatic stress disorder-like behaviours, and forebrain deltaFosB expression, in
rats.

At present, exposure of a rodent to the odour of a predator is one of the most
common animal models of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Despite this, the 
model remains incompletely characterized, particularly in regard to within
subject assessment of major PTSD-like behaviours. In an attempt to redress this
situation, we have extensively characterized the two broad categories of
behaviour that are considered to characterize PTSD, that is sensitized behaviours
such as social withdrawal and hypervigilance and conditioned behaviours such as
avoidance of trauma linked cues. Specifically, we determined the presence and
duration of both conditioned and sensitized behaviours, in the same cohort of
animals, after three exposures to predator odour. Conditioned fear was assessed
on the basis of inhibition of locomotor activity upon return to context 2, 7, 14,
21, and 28 days after the last odour exposure session. To assess the impact on
sensitization behaviours, we monitored acoustic startle responses and social
interaction behaviour 4, 9, 16, 23, and 30 days after the last exposure session. 
In addition to examining the behavioural consequences associated with odour
exposure, we also determined the key brain regions that were activated using
DeltaFosB immunohistochemistry. Our results show that the two groups of
behaviours thought to characterize PTSD (conditioned and sensitized) do not
travel together in the predator odour model, with clear evidence of enduring
changes in conditioned fear but little evidence of changes in social interaction 
or acoustic startle. With regard to associated patterns of activity in the brain,
we observed that odour-exposed animals exhibited significantly higher numbers of 
FosB-positive nuclei in only the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a finding that 
can be viewed as being consistent with the observed behavioural changes.

    Nat Rev Neurosci. 2010 Jul;11(7):455.

In contrast with the many studies of stress effects on the brain, relatively
little is known about the molecular mechanisms of resilience, the ability of some
individuals to escape the deleterious effects of stress. We found that the
transcription factor DeltaFosB mediates an essential mechanism of resilience in
mice. Induction of DeltaFosB in the nucleus accumbens, an important brain
reward-associated region, in response to chronic social defeat stress was both
necessary and sufficient for resilience. DeltaFosB induction was also required
for the standard antidepressant fluoxetine to reverse behavioral pathology
induced by social defeat. DeltaFosB produced these effects through induction of
the GluR2 AMPA glutamate receptor subunit, which decreased the responsiveness of 
nucleus accumbens neurons to glutamate, and through other synaptic proteins.
Together, these findings establish a previously unknown molecular pathway
underlying both resilience and antidepressant action.

Astrocytic transactivation by alpha2A-adrenergic and 5-HT2B serotonergic
signaling.

EGF receptor transactivation has been known for more than ten years. It is a
signal pathway in which a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signal leads to
release of a growth factor, which in turn activates the EGF receptor-tyrosine
kinase in the same or adjacent cells. Astrocytes express a number of GPCRs and
play key roles in brain function. Astrocytic transactivation is of special
interest, since its autocrine effect may regulate gene expression and alter cell 
functions in the cells themselves and its paracrine effect may provide additional
opportunities for cross-talk between astrocytes and their neighbors, such as
neurons. The signal pathways of EGF transactivation are complicated. This does
not only apply to the pathways leading to shedding of growth factor(s), but also 
to the downstream signal pathways of the EGF receptor, i.e., MAPK and PI3K. The
latter may vary according to the type of growth factor released, the sites of
tyrosine phosphorylation on the EGF receptor, and the duration of the
phosphorylation. Using primary cell cultures we have found that dexmedetomidine, 
a specific alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor, induced shedding of HB-EGF from
astrocytes, which in turn transactivated EGF receptors and stimulated astrocytic 
c-Fos and FosB expression. At the same time released HB-EGF protected neurons
from injury caused by H(2)O(2). We have also confirmed dexmedetomidine
transactivation in the brain in vivo. EGF transactivation by 5-HT(2B) receptor
stimulation was responsible for up-regulation of cPLA(2) in astrocytes by
fluoxetine, an antidepressant and inhibitor of the serotonin transporter, which
also is a specific 5-HT(2B) agonist.

The transcription factor DeltaFosB is induced in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) by
drugs of abuse. This study was designed to evaluate the possible modifications in
FosB/DeltaFosB expression in both hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic brain stress
system during morphine dependence and withdrawal. Rats were made dependent on
morphine and, on day 8, were injected with saline or naloxone. Using
immunohistochemistry and western blot, the expression of FosB/DeltaFosB, tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and pro-dynorphin (DYN)
was measured in different nuclei from the brain stress system in
morphine-dependent rats and after morphine withdrawal. Additionally, we studied
the expression of FosB/DeltaFosB in CRF-, TH- and DYN-positive neurons.
FosB/DeltaFosB was induced after chronic morphine administration in the
parvocellular part of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), NAc-shell, 
bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, central amygdala and A(2) noradrenergic part
of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS-A(2)). Morphine dependence and withdrawal 
evoked an increase in FosB/DeltaFosB-TH and FosB/DeltaFosB-CRF double labelling
in NTS-A(2) and PVN, respectively, besides an increase in TH levels in NTS-A(2)
and CRF expression in PVN. These data indicate that neuroadaptation to addictive 
substances, observed as accumulation of FosB/DeltaFosB, is not limited to the
reward circuits but may also manifest in other brain regions, such as the brain
stress system, which have been proposed to be directly related to addiction.

Biosynthesis and functions of bacillithiol, a major low-molecular-weight thiol in
Bacilli.

Bacillithiol (BSH), the alpha-anomeric glycoside of L-cysteinyl-D-glucosamine
with L-malic acid, is a major low-molecular-weight thiol in Bacillus subtilis and
related bacteria. Here, we identify genes required for BSH biosynthesis and
provide evidence that the synthetic pathway has similarities to that established 
for the related thiol (mycothiol) in the Actinobacteria. Consistent with a key
role for BSH in detoxification of electrophiles, the BshA glycosyltransferase and
BshB1 deacetylase are encoded in an operon with methylglyoxal synthase. BshB1 is 
partially redundant in function with BshB2, a deacetylase of the LmbE family.
Phylogenomic profiling identified a conserved unknown function protein (COG4365) 
as a candidate cysteine-adding enzyme (BshC) that co-occurs in genomes also
encoding BshA, BshB1, and BshB2. Additional evolutionarily linked proteins
include a thioredoxin reductase homolog and two thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases
of the DUF1094 (CxC motif) family. Mutants lacking BshA, BshC, or both BshB1 and 
BshB2 are devoid of BSH. BSH is at least partially redundant in function with
other low-molecular-weight thiols: redox proteomics indicates that protein thiols
are largely reduced even in the absence of BSH. At the transcriptional level, the
induction of genes controlled by two thiol-based regulators (OhrR, Spx) occurs
normally. However, BSH null cells are significantly altered in acid and salt
resistance, sporulation, and resistance to electrophiles and thiol reactive
compounds. Moreover, cells lacking BSH are highly sensitive to fosfomycin, an
epoxide-containing antibiotic detoxified by FosB, a prototype for
bacillithiol-S-transferase enzymes.

DeltaFosB indirectly regulates Cck promoter activity.

Some of the important biochemical, structural, and behavioral changes induced by 
chronic exposure to drugs of abuse appear to be mediated by the highly stable
transcription factor DeltaFosB. Previous work has shown that DeltaFosB
overexpression in mice for 2weeks leads to an increase in the expression of
numerous genes in striatum, most of which are later downregulated following
8weeks of FosB expression. Interestingly, a large number of these genes were also
upregulated in mice overexpressing the transcription factor CREB. It was unclear 
from this study, however, whether short-term DeltaFosB regulates these genes via 
CREB. Here, we find that 2weeks of DeltaFosB overexpression increases CREB
expression in striatum, an effect that dissipates by 8weeks. The early induction 
is associated with increased CREB binding to certain target gene promoters in
this brain region. Surprisingly, one gene that was a suspected CREB target based 
on previous reports, cholecystokinin (Cck), was not controlled by CREB in
striatum. To further investigate the regulation of Cck following DeltaFosB
overexpression, we confirmed that short-term DeltaFosB overexpression increases
both Cck promoter activity and gene expression. It also increases binding
activity at a putative CREB binding site (CRE) in the Cck promoter. However,
while the CRE site is necessary for normal basal expression of Cck, it is not
required for DeltaFosB induction of Cck. Taken together, these results suggest
that while short-term DeltaFosB induction increases CREB expression and activity 
at certain gene promoters, this is not the only mechanism by which genes are
upregulated under these conditions.

Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway in
the liver of mice is related to plasma glucose levels after acute exercise.

Germany.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to identify, in the liver of mice, signal transduction 
pathways that show a pronounced regulation by acute exercise. We also aimed to
elucidate the role of metabolic stress in this response.
METHODS: C57Bl6 mice performed a 60 min run on a treadmill under non-exhaustive
conditions. Hepatic RNA and protein lysates were prepared immediately after
running and used for whole-genome-expression analysis, quantitative real-time PCR
and immunoblotting. A subset of mice recovered for 3 h after the treadmill run. A
further group of mice performed the treadmill run after having received a vitamin
C- and vitamin E-enriched diet over 4 weeks.
RESULTS: The highest number of genes differentially regulated by exercise in the 
liver was found in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling
pathway, with a pronounced and transient upregulation of the transcription
factors encoded by c-Fos (also known as Fos), c-Jun (also known as Jun), FosB
(also known as Fosb) and JunB (also known as Junb) and phosphorylation of hepatic
MAPK. Acute exercise also activated the p53 signalling pathway. A major role for 
oxidative stress is unlikely since the antioxidant-enriched diet did not prevent 
the activation of the MAPK pathway. In contrast, lower plasma glucose levels
after running were related to enhanced levels of MAPK signalling proteins,
similar to the upregulation of Igfbp1 and Pgc-1alpha (also known as Ppargc1a). In
the working muscle the activation of the MAPK pathway was weak and not related to
plasma glucose concentrations.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Metabolic stress evidenced as low plasma glucose
levels appears to be an important determinant for the activation of the MAPK
signalling pathway and the transcriptional response of the liver to acute
exercise.

The medial extended amygdala modulates pheromonal perception, influencing
emotional and social behavior. As the amygdala is part of neuronal circuits that 
are very sensitive to excitability, its neurons are targets of seizures in
temporal lobe epilepsy. It has been suggested that the hippocampus is strongly
involved this pathology. There is less consistent information, however, on the
effects of this disease in the amygdala. The effects of status epilepticus on the
medial extended amygdala were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for neural stress 
and by the amino-cupric-silver technique for neuronal death in rats after kainic 
acid (KA) administration. Sixty adult Wistar male rats were used. Thirty animals 
received an injection of KA, and 30 were injected with saline. After 2, 4, 12, 24
and 48 h survival the brains were stained for Fos and FosB and for neuronal
death. In the present study we show that KA induces Fos and FosB expression in
neurons of the medial extended amygdala after 2, 4-48 h, with time courses that
are different between them and from control animals. While Fos-IR peaks at 2-4 h 
post KA and then decreases, FosB-IR increases in the same period reaching its
highest expression at 24-48 h. Moreover, KA injection produced massive neuronal
death with a peak at 24 h. This neurodegeneration paralleled FosB-IR protein
expression. These findings show that KA produces neuronal stress and activation
of early genes and neuronal death in the medial extended amygdala, demonstrating 
the vulnerability of its neurons to the epileptogenic effects of KA.

This study was aimed to investigate the role of bone marrow microenvironment in
the regulation of activator protein 1 (AP-1) expression in multiple myeloma (MM) 
cells. The primary myeloma cells (CD138(+) cells) from 8 patients with MM were
sorted by using immunomagnetic beads and were cocultured with osteoclasts in
alpha-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, RNAKL (50 ng/ml)
and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (25 ng/ml) for 10 to 14 days at 2.5 x
10(6) cells/ml. The expression levels of genes c-jun, junD fos and fosB were
detected by real-time PCR. The results showed that the osteoclasts were observed 
after coculture of mononuclear cells in peripheral blood of MM patients with
osteoclasts for 10 - 14 days. As compared with control (without coculture with
osteoclasts), the viability of MM cells cocultured with osteoclasts obviously
increased, the expression levels of c-jun, junD, fos and fosB decreased to 25.7% 
- 1.66%, 68.49% - 8.54%, 10.35% - 0.19% and 36.63% - 3.44% of the control
respectively. It is concluded that the bone marrow microenvironment can inhibit
the expression of c-jun, junD, fos and fosB promote myeloma cell proliferation
and maintain cell survival.

RATIONALE: In rats, prenatal restraint stress (PRS) induces persistent behavioral
and neurobiological alterations leading to a greater consumption of
psychostimulants during adulthood. However, little is known about alcohol
vulnerability in this animal model.
OBJECTIVES: We examined in adolescent and adult male Sprague Dawley rats the
long-lasting impact of PRS exposure on alcohol consumption.
METHODS: PRS rats were subjected to a prenatal stress (three daily 45-min
sessions of restraint stress to the mothers during the last 10 days of
pregnancy). Alcohol preference was assessed in a two-bottle choice paradigm
(alcohol 2.5%, 5%, or 10% versus water), in both naïve adolescent rats and adult 
rats previously exposed to a chronic alcohol treatment. Behavioral indices
associated with incentive motivation for alcohol were investigated. Finally,
plasma levels of transaminases (marker of hepatic damages) and <U+0394>FosB levels in
the nucleus accumbens (a potential molecular switch for addiction) were evaluated
following the chronic alcohol exposure.
RESULTS: Alcohol preference was not affected by PRS. Contrary to our
expectations, stressed and unstressed rats did not display signs of compulsive
alcohol consumption. The consequences of the alcohol exposure on locomotor
reactivity and on transaminase levels were more prominent in PRS group.
Similarly, PRS potentiated alcohol-induced <U+0394>FosB levels in the nucleus accumbens.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that negative events occurring in utero do not
modulate alcohol preference in male rats but potentiate chronic alcohol-induced
molecular neuroadaptation in the brain reward circuitry. Further studies are
needed to determine whether the exacerbated <U+0394>FosB upregulation in PRS rats could 
be extended to other reinforcing stimuli.

necrosis factor-alpha production and macrophage apoptosis.

Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) impairs tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-alpha)-mediated macrophage apoptosis induced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(Mtb). HIV Nef protein plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AIDS. We
have tested the hypothesis that exogenous Nef is a factor that inhibits TNF-alpha
production/apoptosis in macrophages infected with Mtb. We demonstrate that Mtb
and Nef individually trigger TNF-alpha production in macrophages. However,
TNF-alpha production is dampened when the two are present simultaneously,
probably through cross-regulation of the individual signaling pathways leading to
activation of the TNF-alpha promoter. Mtb-induced TNF-alpha production is
abrogated upon mutation of the Ets, Egr, Sp1, CRE, or AP1 binding sites on the
TNF-alpha promoter, whereas Nef-mediated promoter activation depends only on the 
CRE and AP1 binding sites, pointing to differences in the mechanisms of
activation of the promoter. Mtb-dependent promoter activation depends on the
mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase ASK1 and on MEK/ERK signaling. Nef 
inhibits ASK1/p38 MAPK-dependent Mtb-induced TNF-alpha production probably by
inhibiting binding of ATF2 to the TNF-alpha promoter. It also inhibits
MEK/ERK-dependent Mtb-induced binding of FosB to the promoter. Nef-driven
TNF-alpha production occurs in an ASK1-independent, Rac1/PAK1/p38 MAPK-dependent,
and MEK/ERK-independent manner. The signaling pathways used by Mtb and Nef to
trigger TNF-alpha production are therefore distinctly different. In addition to
attenuating Mtb-dependent TNF-alpha promoter activation, Nef also reduces
Mtb-dependent TNF-alpha mRNA stability probably through its ability to inhibit
ASK1/p38 MAPK signaling. These results provide new insight into how HIV Nef
probably exacerbates tuberculosis infection by virtue of its ability to dampen
Mtb-induced TNF-alpha production.

Striatal inhibition of PKA prevents levodopa-induced behavioural and molecular
changes in the hemiparkinsonian rat.

l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride (l-DOPA) is the gold
standard for symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), but long-term
therapy is associated with the emergence of abnormal involuntary movements (AIMS)
known as l-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LID). The molecular changes underlying LID
are not completely understood. Using the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat model of 
PD, we showed that l-DOPA elicits profound alterations in the activity of three
LID molecular markers, namely DeltaFosB, dopamine, cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 
of 32 kDa (DARPP-32) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2),
as well as in phosphorylation levels of the cytoskeletal-associated protein tau. 
These modifications are triggered by protein kinase A (PKA) activation and
intermittent stimulation of dopamine receptors as they are totally prevented by
intrastriatal injections of Rp-cAMPS, a PKA inhibitor, or by continuous
administration of l-DOPA via subcutaneous mini-pump. Importantly, Rp-cAMPS does
not modulate the positive effect of l-DOPA on locomotor deficits and
significantly attenuates the emergence of AIMS in 6-hydroxydopamine
hydrobromide-lesioned rats. Even if decreased PKA signalling in the striatum may 
represent a clinical challenge, these data provide novel evidence that PKA
activation, through modification of striatal signalling and alterations of
cytoskeletal constituents, plays a key role in the manifestation of LID.

Differential effects of methamphetamine and SCH23390 on the expression of members
of IEG families of transcription factors in the rat striatum.

Methamphetamine (METH) is a psychostimulant that can cause long-lasting
neurodegenerative effects in humans and animals. These toxic effects appear to
occur, in part, via activation of dopamine (DA) D1 receptors. This paper assessed
the possibility that the DA D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390, might inhibit
METH-induced changes in the expression of several members of immediate early
genes (IEGs) which are known to control more delayed expression of other genes.
We found that injections of METH (4x10 mg/kg, given at 2 h intervals) caused
significant increases in c-fos and fra-2 expression which lasted from 30 min to 4
h. Pre-treatment with SCH23390, given 30 min before each METH injection,
completely blocked METH-induced expression of c-fos, but only partially inhibited
fra-2 mRNA expression. These results were confirmed by Western blot analysis
which showed METH-induced changes in c-Fos protein expression that were blocked
by pretreatment with SCH23390. There were also delayed METH-induced DA D1
receptor-dependent effects on fosB mRNA expression. Even though fra-1 expression 
was not affected by pretreatment with METH alone, the repeated injections of
SCH23390 caused substantial decreases in fra-1 mRNA expression in both the
presence and absence of METH. The repeated injections of METH caused no changes
in the mRNAs for c-jun, junB or junD. However, there were significant increases
in the phosphorylation of c-Jun protein (ser63). Phosphorylation of c-Jun
occurred in a delayed fashion (16 and 24 h after the last METH injections) and
was attenuated by SCH23390 pretreatment. Interestingly, SCH23390 given alone
caused significant decreases in phospho-c-Jun at all time-points. The METH
injections also caused delayed induction in the expression of members of the Egr 
family of transcription factors in a DA D1 receptor-dependent fashion. Repeated
injections of SCH23390 caused substantial suppression of basal striatal egr-1 and
egr-2 mRNA expression but not of that of egr-3. Both crem and arc mRNA levels
were induced by METH in a SCH23390-sensitive fashion. Moreover, multiple
injections of SCH23390 given alone caused marked inhibition of basal arc
expression. These results show that multiple injections of METH can
differentially affect the expression of several IEGs, some of which occurred in a
DA D1 receptor dependent fashion. The SCH23390-mediated suppression of basal
fra-1, egr-1, and egr-2 mRNA levels suggests that their basal expression in the
striatum might be dependent on tonic stimulation of the DA D1 receptor.

Cocaine-induced alterations in gene expression cause changes in neuronal
morphology and behavior that may underlie cocaine addiction. In mice, we
identified an essential role for histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) dimethylation and the 
lysine dimethyltransferase G9a in cocaine-induced structural and behavioral
plasticity. Repeated cocaine administration reduced global levels of H3K9
dimethylation in the nucleus accumbens. This reduction in histone methylation was
mediated through the repression of G9a in this brain region, which was regulated 
by the cocaine-induced transcription factor DeltaFosB. Using conditional
mutagenesis and viral-mediated gene transfer, we found that G9a down-regulation
increased the dendritic spine plasticity of nucleus accumbens neurons and
enhanced the preference for cocaine, thereby establishing a crucial role for
histone methylation in the long-term actions of cocaine.

Hyperbaric oxygen induces a cytoprotective and angiogenic response in human
microvascular endothelial cells.

A genome-wide microarray analysis of gene expression was carried out on human
microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) exposed to hyperbaric oxygen treatment
(HBOT) under conditions that approximated clinical settings. Highly up-regulated 
genes included immediate early transcription factors (FOS, FOSB, and JUNB) and
metallothioneins. Six molecular chaperones were also up-regulated immediately
following HBOT, and all of these have been implicated in protein damage control. 
Pathway analysis programs identified the Nrf-2-mediated oxidative stress response
as one of the primary responders to HBOT. Several of the microarray changes in
the Nrf2 pathway and a molecular chaperone were validated using quantitative PCR.
For all of the genes tested (Nrf2, HMOX1, HSPA1A, M1A, ACTC1, and FOS), HBOT
elicited large responses, whereas changes were minimal following treatment with
100% O(2) in the absence of elevated pressure. The increased expression of
immediate early and cytoprotective genes corresponded with an HBOT-induced
increase in cell proliferation and oxidative stress resistance. In addition, HBOT
treatment enhanced endothelial tube formation on Matrigel plates, with
particularly dramatic effects observed following two daily HBO treatments.
Understanding how HBOT influences gene expression changes in endothelial cells
may be beneficial for improving current HBOT-based wound-healing protocols. These
data also point to other potential HBOT applications where stimulating protection
and repair of the endothelium would be beneficial, such as patient
preconditioning prior to major surgery.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) affect the activation of activator
protein-1 (AP-1), which plays an important role in regulating a range of cellular
processes. However, the roles of these signaling factors on hydrogen peroxide
(H(2)O(2))-induced cell death are unclear. This study examined the effects of
H(2)O(2) on the activation of MAPK and AP-1 by exposing the cells to H(2)O(2)
generated by either glucose oxidase or a bolus addition. Exposing BJAB or Jurkat 
cells to H(2)O(2) affected the activities of MAPK differently according to the
method of H(2)O(2) exposure. H(2)O(2) increased the AP-1-DNA binding activity in 
these cells, where continuously generated H(2)O(2) led to an increase in mainly
the c-Fos, FosB and c-Jun proteins. The c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase
(JNK)-mediated activation of c-Jun was shown to be related to the
H(2)O(2)-induced cell death. However, the suppression of H(2)O(2)-induced
oxidative stress by either JNK inhibitor or c-Jun specific antisense transfection
was temporary in the cells exposed to glucose oxidase but not to a bolus
H(2)O(2). This was associated with the disruption of death signaling according to
the severe and prolonged depletion of reduced glutathione. Overall, these results
suggest that H(2)O(2) may decide differently the mode of cell death by affecting 
the intracellular redox state of thiol-containing antioxidants, and this depends 
more closely on the duration exposed to H(2)O(2) than the concentration of this
agent.

INTRODUCTION: Transcription factor activator protein-1 regulates genes involved
in inflammation and repair. The aim of this study was to determine whether
transcription factor activator protein-1 activity in carotid plaques is related
to symptoms, lipid accumulation, or extracellular matrix composition.
METHODS: Twenty-eight atherosclerotic carotid plaques were removed by
endarterectomy and divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of
ipsilateral symptoms (<1 month ago). Activator protein-1 DNA binding activity was
assessed, and subunit (c-Jun, JunD, JunB, c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2) protein
levels analyzed by immunoblotting. Distribution of c-Jun in plaques was analyzed 
by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Plaques associated with symptoms had increased activator protein-1
activity and increased expression of c-Jun and JunD, as compared to asymptomatic 
plaques. Fra-1 and Fra-2 were present in equal amounts in both groups, whereas
JunB, FosB, and c-Fos were undetectable. Activator protein-1 activity correlated 
with cholesteryl ester and elastin in plaques and decreased with age. Activator
protein-1 activity did not correlate with collagen, calcified tissue, or
proteoglycan content.
CONCLUSIONS: Activator protein-1 is increased in plaques associated with
symptoms. The correlation between activator protein-1 and cholesteryl esters
suggests that high activator protein-1 is a marker of plaque vulnerability.
Activator protein-1 expression can also reflect the activation of repair
processes.

FosB null mutant mice show enhanced methamphetamine neurotoxicity: potential
involvement of FosB in intracellular feedback signaling and astroglial function.

Japan. asbcontact@brain.riken.jp

Previous studies show that (1) two members of fos family transcription factors,
c-Fos and FosB, are induced in frontal brain regions by methamphetamine; (2) null
mutation of c-Fos exacerbates methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity; and (3) null
mutation of FosB enhances behavioral responses to cocaine. Here we sought a role 
of FosB in responses to methamphetamine by studying FosB null mutant (-/-) mice. 
After a 10 mg/kg methamphetamine injection, FosB(-/-) mice were more prone to
self-injury. Concomitantly, the intracellular feedback regulators of Sprouty and 
Rad-Gem-Kir (RGK) family transcripts had lower expression profiles in the
frontoparietal cortex and striatum of the FosB(-/-) mice. Three days after
administration of four 10 mg/kg methamphetamine injections, the frontoparietal
cortex and striatum of FosB(-/-) mice contained more degenerated neurons as
determined by Fluoro-Jade B staining. The abundance of the small neutral amino
acids, serine, alanine, and glycine, was lower and/or was poorly induced after
methamphetamine administration in the frontoparietal cortex and striatum of
FosB(-/-) mice. In addition, methamphetamine-treated FosB(-/-) frontoparietal and
piriform cortices showed more extravasation of immunoglobulin, which is
indicative of blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Methamphetamine-induced
hyperthermia, brain dopamine content, and loss of tyrosine hydroxylase
immunoreactivity in the striatum, however, were not different between genotypes. 
These data indicate that FosB is involved in thermoregulation-independent
protective functions against methamphetamine neurotoxicity in postsynaptic
neurons. Our findings suggest two possible mechanisms of FosB-mediated
neuroprotection: one is induction of negative feedback regulation within
postsynaptic neurons through Sprouty and RGK. Another is supporting astroglial
function such as maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, and metabolism of serine
and glycine, which are important glial modulators of nerve cells.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the early molecular responses to
quantified levels of oxidative stress (OS) in the human retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE). Confluent ARPE-19 cells were cultured for 3 days in defined
medium to stabilize gene expression. The cells were exposed to varying levels of 
OS (0-500 microM H(2)O(2)) for 1-8 h and gene expression was followed for up to
24-h after OS. Using real-time qPCR, we quantified the expression of immediate
early genes from the AP-1 transcription factor family and other genes involved in
regulating the redox status of the cells. Significant and quantitative changes
were seen in the expression of six AP-1 transcription factor genes, FosB, c-Fos, 
Fra-1, c-Jun, JunB, and ATF3 from 1-8 h following OS. The peak level of induced
transcription from OS varied from 2- to 128-fold over the first 4 h, depending on
the gene and magnitude of OS. Increased transcription at higher levels of OS was 
also seen for up to 8-h for some of these genes. Protein translation was examined
for 24-h following OS using Western blotting methods, and compared to the qPCR
responses. We identified six AP-1 family genes that demonstrate quantitative
upregulation of expression in response to OS. Two distinct types of quantifiable 
OS-specific responses were observed; dose-dependent responses, and threshold
responses. Our studies show that different levels of OS can regulate the
expression of AP-1 transcription factors quantitatively in the human RPE in
vitro.

Identification of immunohistochemical prognostic markers for survival after
resection of pulmonary metastases from colorectal carcinoma.

BACKGROUND: Although aggressive resection of pulmonary metastases prolongs the
survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, there is a need for
predictive pathologic parameters to understand the key molecular events of
metastatic progression. The aim of this study was to verify immunohistochemical
markers in addition to established clinical parameters after surgery.
METHODS: From our subset of patients undergoing resection of pulmonary metastases
from metastatic colorectal carcinoma, we analyzed 39 patients (23 men and 16
women) between 2003 and 2007. Only patients who met the criteria for a
potentially curative operation were included. All patients were analyzed with
regard to age and sex, primary tumor location, stage of the primary tumor,
history of hepatic metastases, number of pulmonary metastases, pre-thoracotomy
carcinoembryonic (CEA) serum antigen level, and the presence of thoracic lymph
node metastasis. Furthermore, we immunohistochemically investigated the
expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-D, FBJ murine
osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (FOS-B), and melanoma antigen (MAGE)-A in
the surgical specimens of pulmonary metastatic lesions.
RESULTS: The overall 3-year survival was 50.6 %. A significantly longer survival 
was observed with multivariate analysis in patients with a pre-thoracotomy serum 
carcinoembryonic antigen level of no more than 4.2 ng/mL ( P = 0.001), and Dukes 
stage A or B primary tumor ( P = 0.001). A significantly longer recurrence-free
survival was observed with multivariate analysis in patients without thoracic
lymph node involvement compared to patients with pulmonary and/or mediastinal
lymph node metastases ( P = 0.006). The stage of the primary tumor remained
significant ( P = 0.029), and FOS-B expression in tumor cells showed a trend
towards favorable recurrence-free survival after pulmonary metastasectomy ( P =
0.059). No statistically significant difference was found in the overall survival
rate or recurrence-free survival rate of patients with expression of VEGF-D or
MAGE-A antigen in pulmonary metastatic tumor cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that in addition to clinically prognostic
factors, FOS-B expression has a debatable impact on patient survival. We conclude
that the evaluation of molecular and clinical prognostic parameters at the time
of pulmonary metastasectomy offers a greater understanding of the metastatic
process and provides important information for patient selection.

N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist drugs (NMDA-A), such as dizocilpine
(MK801), induce long-lasting behavioral disturbances reminiscent to psychotic
disorders in humans. To identify cortical structures affected by NMDA-A, we used 
a single dose of MK801 (10 mg/kg) that caused low and high neurodegeneration in
intact and orchiectomized male rats, respectively. Degenerating somas (neuronal
death) and axonal/synaptic endings (terminal degeneration) were depicted by a
silver technique, and functionally affected cortical neuronal subpopulations by
Egr-1, c-Fos, and FosB/DeltaFosB-immunolabeling. In intact males, MK801 triggered
a c-Fos induction that remained high for more than 24 h in selected layers of the
retrosplenial, somatosensory and entorhinal cortices. MK801-induced
neurodegeneration reached its peak at 72 h. Degenerating somas were restricted to
layer IV of the granular subdivision of the retrosplenial cortex, and were
accompanied by suppression of Egr-1 immunolabeling. Terminal degeneration
extended to selected layers of the retrosplenial, somatosensory and
parahippocampal cortices, which are target areas of retrosplenial cortex.
Induction of FosB/DeltaFosB by MK801 also extended to the same cortical layers
affected by terminal degeneration, likely reflecting the damage of synaptic
connectivity. In orchiectomized males, the neurodegenerative and functional
effects of MK801 were exacerbated. Degenerative somas in layer IV of the
retrosplenial cortex significantly increased, with a parallel enhancement of
terminal degeneration and FosB/DeltaFosB-expression in the mentioned cortical
structures, but no additional areas were affected. These observations reveal that
synaptic dysfunction/degeneration in the retrosplenial, somatosensory and
parahippocampal cortices might underlie the long-lasting impairments induced by
NMDA-A.

Role of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions in coiled coil stability and
specificity.

We have screened two coiled coil-forming libraries in which core a and
electrostatic e/g positions have been partially randomized. We observed the
relative ability of these residues to confer coiled coil stability using a
protein-fragment complementation assay. Our studies continue with the Jun/Fos
activator protein-1 (AP-1) leucine zipper complex, as it provides a valid
therapeutic target, while representing one of the more simplistic examples of
quaternary structure. In mammalian cells, 28 possible dimeric interactions result
from combinations of cJun, JunB, JunD, cFos, FosB, Fra1, and Fra2. Consequently, 
peptides designed to target particular oncogenic members must bind with high
affinity and also be specific if they are to function as desired. We have
therefore tested the ability of core and electrostatic interactions to confer
stable and specific peptides. A previously selected peptide (FosW) formed the
template for the core and electrostatic libraries. The winner from the core
randomization (FosW(Core)) bound specifically to cJun relative to cFos, FosB,
Fra1, Fra2, and the FosW(Core) homodimer, as verified by thermal melting analyses
and growth competitions in the presence of either a negative control "mock"
peptide or a competitor fusion peptide (cFos-FosB-Fra1-Fra2). In contrast, the
winner from the electrostatic e/g randomization (FosW(e/g)) bound to all
respective complexes with high stability, suggesting that the more significant
energetic contributions made by core residues may be enough to generate
specificity as a consequence of positive design.

Hypericin is used as a powerful naturally occurring photosensitizer in
photodynamic therapy (PDT). Activated by visible light, it kills tumour cells and
tissues via generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Depending on the
protocol, apoptotic cell death can be achieved very effectively by hypericin-PDT.
To analyze the fundamental molecular mechanisms leading to apoptosis induced by
photodamage especially with regard to human skin cancer cells, we studied the
alteration of the gene expression pattern in the human squamous cell carcinoma
cell line A-431 at 1.5, 3, 5 and 8 h after hypericin-PDT by cDNA-macroarray
technique. Radioactively labelled samples were hybridized onto macroarray filters
containing PCR products of 9738 ESTs of the Incyte Human UniGEM Microarray clone 
set. In total, 168 genes were found to be differentially upregulated and 45
down-regulated. Verification of expression changes of 45 genes of interest was
performed by quantitative real-time PCR. Due to the observed significant
expression changes the following can be concluded: lipoprotein receptor-mediated 
endocytosis could play a role in the uptake of lipophilic hypericin.
Extracellular signal transduction to the cell is reduced, cell detachment
facilitated, changes of the morphology, cytoskeleton and formation of apoptotic
bodies occur. The promotion of p38MAPK, ERK, JNK and Ras signalling pathways
supports survival and/or apoptosis. Switches between life and death could be the 
strongly upregulated transcription factors c-jun and FOSB as well as the
MAPK-phosphatase 1 DUSP-1, possibly activated via H3 histone modifications. ROS
activate ER-stress pathways or adaptive response, and provoke damage protection
against ROS, partly in a cell-type specific way.

We designed phosphorothioate-modified DNA probes linked to superparamagnetic iron
oxide nanoparticles (SPION) for in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of fosB 
and Delta fosB mRNA after amphetamine (AMPH) exposure in mice. Specificity of
both the fosB and Delta fosB probes was verified by in vitro reverse
transcriptase-PCR amplification to a single fragment of total cDNA obtained from 
acutely AMPH-exposed mouse brains. We confirmed time-dependent uptake and
retention profiles of both probes in neurons of GAD67-green fluorescent protein
knock-in mice. MRI signal of SPION-labeled fosB probe delivered via
intracerebroventricular route was elevated in both acutely and chronically
AMPH-exposed mice; the signal was suppressed by dopaminergic receptor antagonist 
pretreatment. SPION-labeled Delta fosB probe signal elevation occurred only in
chronically AMPH-exposed mice. The in vivo target specificity of these probes
permits reliable MRI visualization of AMPH-induced differential elevations of
fosB and Delta fosB mRNA in living brains.

Brain region-specific modulation of immediate-early gene (IEG) may constitute a
marker of antipsychotic drug-like activity. We investigated the effects of the
putative antipsychotic drug
N-[(2,2-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-benzofuran-7-yloxy)ethyl]-3-(cyclopent-1-enyl)-benzy
lamine (F15063), a compound that targets both dopamine D(2) and serotonin
5-HT(1A) receptors, in comparison with haloperidol and clozapine on rat mRNA
expression of IEG i.e. the zinc-fingered transcription factors c-fos, fosB,
zif268, c-jun and junB, two transcription factors of the nuclear receptor family 
nur77 and nor1, and the effector IEG arc. F15063 (10 mg/kg) and clozapine (10
mg/kg), but not haloperidol (0.63 mg/kg), induced c-fos and fosB mRNA expression 
in prefrontal cortex, a region associated with control of cognition and negative 
symptoms of schizophrenia. In striatum, only c-fos, fosB, junB and nur77 were
induced by clozapine whereas all IEG mRNAs were increased by haloperidol and
F15063 (from 2.5 mg/kg) with similar high efficacy despite a total absence of
F15063-induced catalepsy. However, at 0.63 mg/kg, F15063 induced a lower degree
of striatal IEG mRNA expression than haloperidol and pretreatment with the
serotonin 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist
N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexane
carboxamide trihydrochloride (WAY100635) (0.63 mg/kg) increased the level of IEG 
mRNA induction by F15063. Furthermore, (+)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin
[(+)-8-OH-DPAT] at 0.16 mg/kg decreased haloperidol-induced striatal IEG mRNA
expression although it exerted no effects on its own. These results are
consistent with an activation of serotonin 5-HT(1A) receptors by F15063, thus
reducing D(2) blockade-induced striatal IEG mRNA. Furthermore, the substantial
F15063-induced expression of IEGs such as c-fos in striatum is not related to
cataleptogenic activity and may act more as a marker of efficacious dopamine D(2)
receptor blockade.

FosB is a member of the Fos family transcription factors. To determine whether
FosB expression is regulated by glucocorticoids (GCs) in the hypothalamus, rats
underwent sham adrenalectomy (sham-ADX) or bilateral ADX, and FosB/DeltaFosB
(DeltaFosB, a truncated splice variant of FosB)-immunoreactivity (ir) was
determined in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON). In 
the parvocellular division of the PVN (paPVN) and SON,
FosB/DeltaFosB-immunoreactivity (ir) increased significantly following sham-ADX
compared to naive rats, which was suppressed with either corticosterone (CORT) or
dexamethasone (DEX). Following ADX, the increase in FosB/DeltaFosB-ir was much
more prominent than that in the sham-ADX group, and the ADX-induced robust
increase was suppressed by CORT or DEX, but not by aldosterone. Stressless
removal of CORT from drinking water did not induce FosB/DeltaFosB-ir in either
the PVN or SON, and thus the up-regulation of FosB/DeltaFosB-ir following ADX was
dependent on the systemic stress associated with surgery. In the paPVN, the
majority of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurones co-expressed
FosB/DeltaFosB-ir following ADX, whereas, in the magnocellular division of the
PVN, vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OXT) neurones did not express
FosB/DeltaFosB-ir. In the SON, approximately 40% of the AVP neurones co-expressed
FosB/DeltaFosB-ir following ADX, but the OXT neurones were devoid of
FosB/DeltaFosB-ir. In concert with these results obtained in vivo, DEX suppressed
the forskolin-induced increase in FosB gene promoter activity in a homologous
hypothalamic cell line. These results suggest that GCs may be a potent regulator 
of FosB/DeltaFosB expression, which is induced by stress, in hypothalamic
neuroendocrine neurones.

Mechanical stress induces Interleukin-11 expression to stimulate osteoblast
differentiation.

Molecular mechanism of mechanical stress-induced bone formation remains unclear. 
We demonstrate that mechanical unloading suppresses and reloading enhances
Interleukin (IL)-11 gene expression in the hindlimb of mice in vivo. Mechanical
stress to osteoblasts by fluid shear stress (FSS) in vitro rapidly and
transiently enhances fosB gene transcription, stimulates binding of
DeltaFosB/JunD complex to activator protein (AP)-1 site of the IL-11 gene
promoter, and enhances IL-11 gene transcription. Anti-IL-11 antibody blocks
mechanical stress-induced enhancement of osteoblastogenesis and suppression of
adipogenesis, suggesting the requirement of IL-11 for the stimulation of
osteoblast differentiation by mechanical stress. Down-regulation of
DeltaFosB/JunD by small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppresses and overexpression of 
DeltaFosB/JunD enhances IL-11 gene promoter activity. Consistent with our
previous observations that up-regulation of DeltaFosB depends upon activation of 
cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) via Ca(2+)-dependent
activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) to phosphorylate CREB, 
mechanical stress-induced activation of IL-11 gene transcription is dependent
upon Ca(2+)-ERK pathway. Present results also demonstrated that FSS to
osteoblasts enhances canonical Wnt signaling in vitro, and that mechanical
unloading induces and reloading suppresses the expression of a canonical Wnt
signal inhibitor, dickkopf2 (Dkk2), in vivo. In addition, IL-11 siRNA enhances
Dkk2 expression suppressed by FSS, and osteoblasts from IL-11 transgenic mice
show reduced Dkk2 mRNA expression than those from wild-type mice. These
observations are consistent with the notion that mechanical stress stimulates
IL-11 gene transcription via an enhanced DeltaFosB/JunD binding to the IL-11 gene
promoter, and that increased IL-11 enhances canonical Wnt signal at least in part
via a reduction in Dkk2 expression to stimulate osteoblast differentiation.

Transactivation and expression patterns of Jun and Fos/AP-1 super-family proteins
in human oral cancer.

Transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1) super-family is known to modulate
expression of array of genes during development of many cancers and considered as
an important target for modern therapeutics. But the role of AP-1 during
development of human oral cancers is still poorly understood. Because oral cancer
is one of the most common cancers in India and south-east Asia, we studied the
activation and expression pattern of AP-1 family of proteins and mRNA in
different stages of oral carcinogenesis. Gel-shift assay, western blotting,
immunohistochemistry and northern blotting have been used to assess the binding
activity and expression pattern of AP-1 family (c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, FosB,
Fra-1 and Fra-2) proteins and mRNA transcripts in a total of 100 fresh oral
tissue specimens comprising precancer (n = 40), cancer (n = 50) and healthy
control (n = 10). Constitutive activation of AP-1 with concomitant upregulated
expression of majority of AP-1 family of proteins and mRNA was observed in cancer
cases. Interestingly, almost all precancerous cases showed JunD homodimers,
whereas c-Fos/JunD was the most prevalent complex found in cancer tissues. The
overexpression of EGFR mRNA, p50:p50/NF-kappaB homodimer formation, together with
overexpression of pERK and c-Fos proteins in this study suggests an interesting
cross talk between AP-1 and NF-kappaB pathways in oral cancers. Thus, this study 
demonstrates differential expression and activation of AP-1 super-family proteins
in relation to severity of lesion and their crucial role in human oral
carcinogenesis.

The Mdm2 ubiquitin ligase is an important regulator of p53 abundance and
p53-dependent apoptosis. Mdm2 expression is frequently regulated by a p53 Mdm2
autoregulatory loop whereby p53 stimulates Mdm2 expression and hence its own
degradation. Although extensively studied in cell lines, relatively little is
known about Mdm2 expression in heart where oxidative stress (exacerbated during
ischemia-reperfusion) is an important pro-apoptotic stimulus. We demonstrate that
Mdm2 transcript and protein expression are induced by oxidative stress (0.2 mm
H(2)O(2)) in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. In other cells, constitutive Mdm2
expression is regulated by the P1 promoter (5' to exon 1), with inducible
expression regulated by the P2 promoter (in intron 1). In myocytes, H(2)O(2)
increased Mdm2 expression from the P2 promoter, which contains two p53-response
elements (REs), one AP-1 RE, and two Ets REs. H(2)O(2) did not detectably
increase expression of p53 mRNA or protein but did increase expression of several
AP-1 transcription factors. H(2)O(2) increased binding of AP-1 proteins (c-Jun,
JunB, JunD, c-Fos, FosB, and Fra-1) to an Mdm2 AP-1 oligodeoxynucleotide probe,
and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed it increased binding of c-Jun or 
JunB to the P2 AP-1 RE. Finally, antisense oligonucleotide-mediated reduction of 
H(2)O(2)-induced Mdm2 expression increased caspase 3 activation. Thus, increased 
Mdm2 expression is associated with transactivation at the P2 AP-1 RE (rather than
the p53 or Ets REs), and Mdm2 induction potentially represents a cardioprotective
response to oxidative stress.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone-mediated phosphorylation of estrogen
receptor-alpha contributes to fosB expression in mouse gonadotrophs.

Estrogen receptors (ERs) are activated by their ligands as well as signaling
pathways that alter ER phosphorylation in response to peptide hormones and growth
factors. In pituitary gonadotrophs, GnRHs act via the type I GnRH receptor
(GnRHR). Both GnRH subtypes (GnRH-I and -II) activate an estrogen response
element (ERE)-driven luciferase reporter gene in LbetaT2 mouse pituitary cells,
and GnRH-I is most potent in this regard. Moreover, antide (a GnRH antagonist)
and a GnRHR small interfering RNA (siRNA) abrogate this effect, whereas an
ERalpha antagonist (ICI 182,780) does not. The ERalpha in LbetaT2 cells is
phosphorylated at Ser(118) in the nucleus and at Ser(167) in both nucleus and
cytoplasm after GnRH treatments and coincided with increased ERalpha binding to
its coactivator, the p300/cAMP response element-binding protein-associated factor
(PCAF). Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of PCAF levels attenuated GnRH-induced
ERE-luciferase transactivation in these cells. Most importantly, both GnRH
subtypes robustly up-regulated expression of the immediate early response gene,
fosB, whereas cotreatment with ERalpha siRNA or PCAF siRNA attenuated this
effect. This appears to occur at the transcriptional level because corecruitment 
of ERalpha and PCAF to an ERE within the endogenous fosB promoter was increased
by GnRH treatments, as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. These data 
demonstrate that GnRH-mediated phosphorylation of ERalpha in mouse LbetaT2
pituitary cells results in its rapid association with PCAF and the
transcriptional activation of fosB, and we demonstrate that this in turn likely
activates other genes in pituitary cells including the FSH beta-subunit gene.

Repeated activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system results in persistent
behavioral alterations accompanied by a pattern of neural plasticity in the
nucleus accumbens (NAc). As the accumulation of the transcription factor Delta
FosB may be an important component of this plasticity, the question addressed in 
our research is whether Delta FosB is regulated by sexual experience in females. 
We have shown that female Syrian hamsters, given sexual experience, exhibit
several behavioral alterations including increased sexual efficiency with naïve
male hamsters, sexual reward and enhanced responsiveness to psychomotor
stimulants (e.g. amphetamine). We recently demonstrated that sexual experience
increased the levels of Delta FosB in the NAc of female Syrian hamsters. The
focus of this study was to explore the functional consequences of this induction 
by determining if the constitutive overexpression of Delta FosB by
adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors in the NAc could mimic the behavioral
effects of sexual experience. Animals with AAV-mediated overexpression of Delta
FosB in the NAc showed evidence of sexual reward in a conditioned place
preference paradigm under conditions in which control animals receiving an
injection of AAV-green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the NAc did not. Sexual
behavior tests further showed that males paired with the AAV-Delta FosB females
had increased copulatory efficiency as measured by the proportion of mounts that 
included intromission compared to males mated with the AAV-GFP females. These
results support a role for Delta FosB in mediating natural motivated behaviors,
in this case female sexual behavior, and provide new insight into the possible
endogenous actions of Delta FosB.

Cat odor elicits defensive responses in rats that are modified by repeated
exposure to the odor. We explored the neural correlates of this adaptation using 
FosB/DeltaFosB immunohistochemistry. Rats were given 3 x60 min exposures to
either a worn cat collar (repeated cat odor group) or unworn cat collar (control 
group). Each exposure was separated by 48h. Rats exposed to cat odor initially
showed strong defensive responses (decreased contact, increased retreat, and
increased fecal pellets), however these responses had habituated by the final
exposure. Rats were perfused 24h or 7 days after the final exposure and the
brains were processed for FosB/DeltaFosB protein expression. Up-regulation of
FosB/DeltaFosB was observed 24h after repeated cat odor exposure in the nucleus
accumbens core, caudate putamen, ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, and four
hypothalamic regions: lateral hypothalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus, anterior
hypothalamic nucleus, and dorsal premammillary nucleus. FosB/DeltaFosB expression
remained elevated 7 days after repeated cat odor exposure in the nucleus
accumbens core, caudate putamen and anterior hypothalamic nucleus. These findings
provide initial evidence that behavioral changes occurring as a result of
repeated predatory stress are associated with long-lasting regionally specific
neuroadaptations in the brain.

The aim is to setup single distinguished molecular network. We constructed FOS
proliferating network from 22 colorectal samples of the same GEO dataset by
GRNInfer tool and DAVID based on linear programming and a decomposition procedure
with integrated Kappa statistics and fuzzy heuristic clustering. In the control, 
we found no proliferating subnetwork. In CRC, we identified one FOS proliferating
module (SFRP2, ADAMTS1, SYNPO2, VIP, ADAM33 inhibition to FOS and MGP, FOSB
activation to FOS. FOS activation to IGFBP5, LGI1, GAS1 and FOS inhibition to
VIP). These results may be useful for developing novel prognostic markers and
therapeutic targets in CRC.

The transcription factor DeltaFosB is accumulated in the addiction circuitry,
including the orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortices of rodents chronically
exposed to ethanol or other drugs of abuse, and has been suggested to play a
direct role in addiction maintenance. To address this hypothesis in the context
of substance dependence in humans, we compared the immunoreactivities of FOSB
proteins in the orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (OFC and DLPFC
respectively) between controls and alcoholics using semiquantitative
immunoblotting. In both structures, we detected three forms of FOSB, one of which
was DeltaFOSB, but in neither case did their immunoreactivities differ between
the groups. Our results indicate that the DeltaFOSB immunoreactivity in the human
brain is very low, and that it is not accumulated in the OFC and DLPFC of human
alcoholics, suggesting that it may not be directly involved in addiction
maintenance, at least not in ethanol dependence.

Genetic inactivation of dopamine D1 but not D2 receptors inhibits L-DOPA-induced 
dyskinesia and histone activation.

Investigación Biomédica en Red para Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas, Instituto de
Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.

BACKGROUND: Pharmacologic studies have implicated dopamine D1-like receptors in
the development of dopamine precursor molecule 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine
(L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesias and associated molecular changes in hemiparkinsonian
mice. However, pharmacologic agents for D1 or D2 receptors also recognize other
receptor family members. Genetic inactivation of the dopamine D1 or D2 receptor
was used to define the involvement of these receptor subtypes.
METHODS: During a 3-week period of daily L-DOPA treatment (25 mg/kg), mice were
examined for development of contralateral turning behavior and dyskinesias.
L-DOPA-induced changes in expression of signaling molecules and other proteins in
the lesioned striatum were examined immunohistochemically.
RESULTS: Chronic L-DOPA treatment gradually induced rotational behavior and
dyskinesia in wildtype hemiparkinsonian mice. Dyskinetic symptoms were associated
with increased FosB and dynorphin expression, phosphorylation of extracellular
signal-regulated kinase, and phosphoacetylation of histone 3 (H3) in the lesioned
striatum. These molecular changes were restricted to striatal areas with complete
dopaminergic denervation and occurred only in dynorphin-containing neurons of the
direct pathway. D1 receptor inactivation abolished L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias and
associated molecular changes. Inactivation of the D2 receptor had no significant 
effect on the behavioral or molecular response to chronic L-DOPA.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the dopamine D1 receptor is critical
for the development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias in mice and in the underlying
molecular changes in the denervated striatum and that the D2 receptor has little 
or no involvement. In addition, we demonstrate that H3 phosphoacetylation is
blocked by D1 receptor inactivation, suggesting that inhibitors of H3 acetylation
and/or phosphorylation may be useful in preventing or reversing dyskinesia.

Lasting reduction of cocaine action in neostriatum--a hydrolase gene therapy
approach.

Gao Y(1), Brimijoin S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo
Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.

We previously found that a quadruple mutant cocaine hydrolase derived from human 
butyrylcholinesterase [termed cocaine esterase (CocE)] can suppress or reverse
cocaine toxicity and abolish drug-primed reinstatement in rats. Here, we examined
whether gene transfer of CocE reduces cocaine actions in brain reward centers.
Early experiments used a standard, early region 1-deleted adenoviral vector,
which, after intravenous delivery of 10(10) plaque-forming units, caused plasma
cocaine hydrolase activity to rise 25,000-fold between day 4 and day 7. During
this period, under a protocol that typically induces FosB expression in the
caudate nucleus, these rats and unprotected controls given only empty vector or
saline were subjected to repeated twice-daily injections of cocaine (30 mg/kg
i.p.). Immunohistochemistry of the neostriatum on day 7 showed many FosB-reactive
nuclei in unprotected rats but few if any in rats pretreated with active vector, 
which resembled rats never exposed to cocaine. Western blots confirmed this
result. In contrast there was a more localized protection against
cocaine-elicited FosB induction when hydrolase vector was injected directly into 
the ventral striatum, which generated high transgene expression in many neurons
of the target area. Similar results were obtained with systemic and local
injection of a more efficient helper-dependent adenoviral vector, which
transduced high levels of hydrolase for at least 2 months, with lesser expression
continued up to 1 year. Behavioral tests are now warranted to determine whether
such effects can reduce drug-seeking behavior and lower the probability of
relapse.

Changes in gene expression contribute to the long-lasting regulation of the
brain's reward circuitry seen in drug addiction; however, the specific genes
regulated and the transcriptional mechanisms underlying such regulation remain
poorly understood. Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with
promoter microarray analysis to characterize genome-wide chromatin changes in the
mouse nucleus accumbens, a crucial brain reward region, after repeated cocaine
administration. Our findings reveal several interesting principles of gene
regulation by cocaine and of the role of DeltaFosB and CREB, two prominent
cocaine-induced transcription factors, in this brain region. The findings also
provide comprehensive insight into the molecular pathways regulated by
cocaine-including a new role for sirtuins (Sirt1 and Sirt2)-which are induced in 
the nucleus accumbens by cocaine and, in turn, dramatically enhance the
behavioral effects of the drug.

extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling in the striatum and
long-term behavioral responses to cocaine.

Foundation and University, Milano, Italy.

BACKGROUND: Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Ras-ERK) signaling is
central to the molecular machinery underlying cognitive functions. In the
striatum, ERK1/2 kinases are co-activated by glutamate and dopamine D1/5
receptors, but the mechanisms providing such signaling integration are still
unknown. The Ras-guanine nucleotide-releasing factor 1 (Ras-GRF1), a neuronal
specific activator of Ras-ERK signaling, is a likely candidate for coupling these
neurotransmitter signals to ERK kinases in the striatonigral medium spiny neurons
(MSN) and for modulating behavioral responses to drug abuse such as cocaine.
METHODS: We used genetically modified mouse mutants for Ras-GRF1 as a source of
primary MSN cultures and organotypic slices, to perform both immunoblot and
immunofluorescence studies in response to glutamate and dopamine receptor
agonists. Mice were also subjected to behavioral and immunohistochemical
investigations upon treatment with cocaine.
RESULTS: Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in response to glutamate, dopamine D1 agonist,
or both stimuli simultaneously is impaired in Ras-GRF1-deficient striatal cells
and organotypic slices of the striatonigral MSN compartment. Consistently,
behavioral responses to cocaine are also affected in mice deficient for Ras-GRF1 
or overexpressing it. Both locomotor sensitization and conditioned place
preference are significantly attenuated in Ras-GRF1-deficient mice, whereas a
robust facilitation is observed in overexpressing transgenic animals. Finally, we
found corresponding changes in ERK1/2 activation and in accumulation of
FosB/DeltaFosB, a well-characterized marker for long-term responses to cocaine,
in MSN from these animals.
CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly implicate Ras-GRF1 in the integration of the 
two main neurotransmitter inputs to the striatum and in the maladaptive
modulation of striatal networks in response to cocaine.

Priming for L-DOPA-induced abnormal involuntary movements increases the severity 
of amphetamine-induced dyskinesia in grafted rats.

In some patients, graft-induced dyskinesia develops following intrastriatal
transplantation of embryonic neural tissue for the treatment of Parkinson's
disease. The mechanisms underlying these involuntary movements need to be
clarified before this approach to clinical cell therapy can be developed further.
We previously found that rats with 6-OHDA lesions, primed with L-DOPA treatment
and that have subsequently undergone intrastriatal graft surgery exhibit
involuntary movements when subjected to amphetamine. This model of
amphetamine-induced AIMs reflects a pattern of post-graft behaviours that in the 
absence of robust spontaneous GID in the rat is the closest approximation that we
currently have available. We now show that they are associated with the chronic
administration of L-DOPA prior to the transplantation surgery. We also
demonstrate that neither changes in c-fos nor FosB/DeltaFosB expression in the
lateral striatum are associated with the expression of these behaviours. Taken
together, these data reveal that the severity of abnormal movements elicited by
amphetamine in grafted animals may relate to previous L-DOPA exposure and
dyskinesia development, but they develop through mechanisms that are independent 
of FosB/DeltaFosB upregulation.

The regulation of megakaryocytic differentiation is poorly understood. Using K562
cells, which can partly recapitulate the process in response to phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), we performed microarray-based gene expression
profiling to identify genes that play significant roles in megakaryopoiesis.
Here, we describe the function of FosB, an AP-1 transcription factor. FosB is
induced in PMA treated K562 cells in a sustained manner and forms an active AP-1 
protein-DNA complex. Down-regulation of FosB with specific shRNAs inhibited the
induction of CD41, a specific cell surface marker of megakaryocytes. We also show
that activation of the PKC-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is required for induction of
FosB and CD41. Finally, we cross-examined the microarray data in conjunction with
gene function annotation data to identify additional target genes of FosB. We
define 3 genes, INHBA, CD9, and ITGA2B as regulatory targets of FosB and show
that CD9, in particular, is a direct target of FosB.

An extensive body of literature provides evidence for both sexual dimorphism and 
menstrual cycle effects in drug abuse patterns and behavioral responses. However,
the cellular mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic responses to and hormonal
effects on cocaine use remain unclear. We hypothesized that endogenous hormonal
fluctuations during the estrous cycle of rats modulate cocaine's effects on
dopamine- and PKA-mediated intracellular responses. To test this hypothesis,
intact female rats at different stages of their cycle received a single injection
of saline or cocaine (20 mg/kg) and were sacrificed after 15 or 60 min. The
nucleus accumbens (NAc) and caudate putamen (CPu) were dissected and analyzed via
Western blot for total and phosphorylated (p-thr34) dopamine- and 3'-5'-cyclic
AMP-regulated phosphoprotein with molecular weight 32 kDa (DARPP-32), PP1, PP2B
(CNA1 and CNB1 subunits), PKA, CREB, cFOS, and Delta-FosB. Our results show that 
saline-treated rats had estrous cycle-related differences in protein levels of
pCREB, DARPP-32, p-thr34-DARPP-32, PP1, and CNA1. Saline-treated female rats in
the estrus stage had higher levels of pCREB in the NAc, but cocaine-treatment
lowered pCREB levels. The estrous cycle also significantly affected the magnitude
of change for p-thr34-DARPP-32 protein levels in both the NAc and CPu. Sixty
minutes of cocaine administration increased p-thr34-DARPP-32 levels in the NAc of
rats during estrus and proestrus and in the CPu of rats in diestrus. Furthermore,
cocaine-induced changes in PP1 protein levels in the NAc were also affected by
the stage of the cycle; 60 min of cocaine administration increased PP1 levels in 
the NAc of rats during diestrus, whereas PP-1 levels decreased in rats during
estrus. Taken together, these novel findings suggest that hormonal fluctuations
during the estrous cycle may contribute to the previously reported sex
differences in the PKA pathway and in behavioral responses to cocaine.

FOS expression.

PRIP (peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor interacting protein) is a
nuclear receptor coactivator required for mammary gland development. To
understand the function of PRIP in breast tumorigenesis, we established a mammary
tumor cell line with the PRIP(Loxp/Loxp) genotype. By knocking out the PRIP gene 
in the tumor cell line, we demonstrated that PRIP deficiency led to inhibited
tumor formation without affecting tumor cell proliferation. The PRIP deficiency
was associated with decreased cell invasion and migration capabilities. We found 
that PRIP deficiency substantially reduced FOS gene expression. A chromatin
immunoprecipitation assay revealed that PRIP was recruited to the FOS promoter.
In addition, we demonstrated that PRIP also directly up-regulated the FOS gene
expression in human breast cancer cells. Promoter analysis showed that PRIP acted
through serum-responsive factor to regulate FOS gene expression. Finally, by
re-expressing the FOS gene, we confirmed that the inhibited tumor formation of
PRIP-deficient tumor cells was due to reduced expression of the FOS gene.

Besides alcohol, alcohol-preferring AA and alcohol-avoiding ANA rats differ also 
with respect to other abused drugs. To study the molecular basis of these
differences, we examined the expression of two transcription factors implicated
in addiction, DeltaFosB and pCREB, in brain dopaminergic regions of AA and ANA
rats. The effects of morphine and nicotine were studied to relate the behavioral 
and molecular changes induced by these drugs. Baseline FosB/DeltaFosB
immunoreactivity (IR) in the nucleus accumbens core and pCREB IR in the
prefrontal cortex (PFC) were elevated in AA rats. Morphine increased
DeltaFosB-like IR more readily in the caudate-putamen of AA rats than in ANA
rats. In the PFC morphine decreased pCREB IR in AA rats, but increased it in ANA 
rats. In addition to enhanced locomotor response, the development of place
preference to morphine was enhanced in AA rats. The enhanced nicotine-induced
locomotor sensitization found in AA compared with ANA rats seems to depend in
addition to dopamine and DeltaFosB on other mechanisms. These findings suggest
that enhanced sensitivity of AA rats to morphine is related to augmented
morphine-induced expression of FosB/DeltaFosB and morphine-induced reduction of
pCREB levels. Moreover, altered innate expression of FosB/DeltaFosB and pCREB in 
AA rats is likely to affect the sensitivity of these rats to abused drugs.

Continuous bone remodeling in response to mechanical loading is critical for
skeletal integrity, and interstitial fluid flow is an important stimulus for
osteoblast/osteocyte growth and differentiation. However, the biochemical signals
mediating osteoblast anabolic responses to mechanical stimulation are
incompletely understood. In primary human osteoblasts and murine MC3T3-E1 cells, 
we found that fluid shear stress induced rapid expression of c-fos, fra-1, fra-2,
and fosB/DeltafosB mRNAs; these genes encode transcriptional regulators that
maintain skeletal integrity. Fluid shear stress increased osteoblast nitric oxide
(NO) synthesis, leading to activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG).
Pharmacological inhibition of the NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway blocked
shear-induced expression of all four fos family genes. Induction of these genes
required signaling through MEK/Erk, and Erk activation was NO/cGMP/PKG-dependent.
Treating cells with a membrane-permeable cGMP analog partly mimicked the effects 
of fluid shear stress on Erk activity and fos family gene expression. In cells
transfected with small interfering RNAs (siRNA) specific for membrane-bound PKG
II, shear- and cGMP-induced Erk activation and fos family gene expression was
nearly abolished and could be restored by transducing cells with a virus encoding
an siRNA-resistant form of PKG II; in contrast, siRNA-mediated repression of the 
more abundant cytosolic PKG I isoform was without effect. Thus, we report a novel
function for PKG II in osteoblast mechanotransduction, and we propose a model
whereby NO/cGMP/PKG II-mediated Erk activation and induction of c-fos, fra-1,
fra-2, and fosB/DeltafosB play a key role in the osteoblast anabolic response to 
mechanical stimulation.

Noninjurious mechanical ventilation activates a proinflammatory transcriptional
program in the lung.

Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving intervention in patients with respiratory
failure. However, human and animal studies have demonstrated that mechanical
ventilation using large tidal volumes (>or=12 ml/kg) induces a potent
inflammatory response and can cause acute lung injury. We hypothesized that
mechanical ventilation with a "noninjurious" tidal volume of 10 ml/kg would still
activate a transcriptional program that places the lung at risk for severe
injury. To identify key regulators of this transcriptional response, we
integrated gene expression data obtained from whole lungs of spontaneously
breathing mice and mechanically ventilated mice with computational network
analysis. Topological analysis of the gene product interaction network identified
Jun and Fos families of proteins as potential regulatory hubs. Electrophoretic
mobility gel shift assay confirmed protein binding to activator protein-1 (AP-1) 
consensus sequences, and supershift experiments identified JunD and FosB as
components of ventilation-induced AP-1 binding. Specific recruitment of JunD to
the regulatory region of the F3 gene by mechanical ventilation was confirmed by
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. In conclusion, we demonstrate a novel
computational framework to systematically dissect transcriptional programs
activated by mechanical ventilation in the lung, and show that noninjurious
mechanical ventilation initiates a response that can prime the lung for injury
from a subsequent insult.

Comment in
    J Comp Neurol. 2009 Apr 20;513(6):559-65.

We previously showed that chronic psychostimulant exposure induces the
transcription factor DeltaFosB in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons of 
the caudal tier of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). This subregion was defined
as the tail of the VTA (tVTA). In the present study, we showed that tVTA can also
be visualized by analyzing FosB/DeltaFosB response following acute cocaine
injection. This induction occurs in GABAergic neurons, as identified by glutamic 
acid decarboxylase (GAD) expression. To characterize tVTA further, we mapped its 
inputs by using the retrograde tracers Fluoro-Gold or cholera toxin B subunit.
Retrogradely labeled neurons were observed in the medial prefrontal cortex, the
lateral septum, the ventral pallidum, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis,
the substantia innominata, the medial and lateral preoptic areas, the lateral and
dorsal hypothalamic areas, the lateral habenula, the intermediate layers of the
superior colliculus, the dorsal raphe, the periaqueductal gray, and the
mesencephalic and pontine reticular formation. Projections from the prefrontal
cortex, the hypothalamus, and the lateral habenula to the tVTA were also shown by
using the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA). We showed that the
central nucleus of the amygdala innervates the anterior extent of the VTA but not
the tVTA. Moreover, the tVTA mainly receives non-aminergic inputs from the dorsal
raphe and the locus coeruleus. Although the tVTA has a low density of
dopaminergic neurons, its afferents are mostly similar to those targeting the
rest of the VTA. This suggests that the tVTA can be considered as a VTA subregion
despite its caudal location.

Methylphenidate is the psychostimulant medication most commonly prescribed to
treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Recent trends in the high 
usage of methylphenidate for both therapeutic and nontherapeutic purposes
prompted us to investigate the long-term effects of exposure to the drug on
neuronal adaptation. We compared the effects of chronic methylphenidate or
cocaine (15 mg/kg, 14 days for both) exposure in mice on dendritic spine
morphology and DeltaFosB expression in medium-sized spiny neurons (MSN) from
ventral and dorsal striatum. Chronic methylphenidate increased the density of
dendritic spines in MSN-D1 (MSN-expressing dopamine D1 receptors) from the core
and shell of nucleus accumbens (NAcc) as well as MSN-D2 (MSN-expressing dopamine 
D2 receptors) from the shell of NAcc. In contrast, cocaine increased the density 
of spines in both populations of MSN from all regions of striatum. In general,
the effect of methylphenidate on the increase of shorter spines (class 2) was
less than that of cocaine. Interestingly, the methylphenidate-induced increase in
the density of relatively longer spines (class 3) in the shell of NAcc was bigger
than that induced by cocaine. Furthermore, methylphenidate exposure increased
expression of DeltaFosB only in MSN-D1 from all areas of striatum, and
surprisingly, the increase was greater than that induced by cocaine. Thus, our
results show differential effects of methylphenidate and cocaine on neuronal
adaptation in specific types of MSN in reward-related brain regions.

BACKGROUND: Nrf1 [p45 nuclear factor-erythroid 2 (p45 NF-E2)-related factor 1], a
member of the CNC-bZIP (CNC basic region leucine zipper) family, is known to be a
transcriptional activator by dimerization with distinct partners, such as Maf,
FosB, c-Jun, JunD, etc. The transcriptional roles of CNC-bZIP family are
demonstrated to be involved in globin gene expression as well as the antioxidant 
response. For example, CNC-bZIP factors can regulate the expression of
detoxification proteins through AREs, such as expression of human
gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetases (GCS), glutathione S-transferases (GST),
UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UDP-GT), NADP (H) quinone oxidoreductase (NQOs),
etc. To further explore other factor(s) in cells related to the function of Nrf1,
we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening assay to identify any Nrf1-interacting 
proteins. In this study, we isolated a cDNA encoding residues 126-475 of MCRS2
from the HeLa cell cDNA library. Some functions of MCRS1 and its splice
variant-MSP58 and MCRS2 have been previously identified, such as transforming,
nucleolar sequestration, ribosomal gene regulation, telomerase inhibition
activities, etc. Here, we demonstrated MCRS2 can function as a repressor on the
Nrf1-mediated transactivation using both in vitro and in vivo systems.
RESULTS: To find other proteins interacting with the CNC bZIP domain of Nrf1, the
CNC-bZIP region of Nrf1 was used as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening assay.
MCRS2, a splicing variant of p78/MCRS1, was isolated as the Nrf1-interacting
partner from the screenings. The interaction between Nrf1 and MCRS2 was confirmed
in vitro by GST pull-down assays and in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation. Further, 
the Nrf1-MCRS2 interaction domains were mapped to the residues 354-447 of Nrf1 as
well as the residues 314-475 of MCRS2 respectively, by yeast two-hybrid and GST
pull-down assays. By immunofluorescence, MCRS2-FLAG was shown to colocalize with 
HA-Nrf1 in the nucleus and didn't result in the redistribution of Nrf1. This
suggested the existence of Nrf1-MCRS2 complex in vivo. To further confirm the
biological function, a reporter driven by CNC-bZIP protein binding sites was also
shown to be repressed by MCRS2 in a transient transfection assay. An artificial
reporter gene activated by LexA-Nrf1 was also specifically repressed by MCRS2.
CONCLUSION: From the results, we showed MCRS2, a new Nrf1-interacting protein,
has a repression effect on Nrf1-mediated transcriptional activation. This was the
first ever identified repressor protein related to Nrf1 transactivation.

The effects of addictive drugs change with repeated use: many individuals become 
tolerant of their pleasurable effects but also more sensitive to negative
sequelae (e.g., anxiety, paranoia, and drug craving). Understanding the
mechanisms underlying such tolerance and sensitization may provide valuable
insight into the basis of drug dependency and addiction. We have recently shown
that chronic cocaine administration reduces the ability of an acute injection of 
cocaine to affect impulsivity in rats. However, animals become more impulsive
during withdrawal from cocaine self-administration. We have also shown that
chronic administration of cocaine increases expression of the transcription
factor DeltaFosB in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Mimicking this drug-induced
elevation in OFC DeltaFosB through viral-mediated gene transfer mimics these
behavioural changes: DeltaFosB over-expression in OFC induces tolerance to the
effects of an acute cocaine challenge but sensitizes rats to the cognitive
sequelae of withdrawal. Here we report novel data demonstrating that increasing
DeltaFosB in the OFC also sensitizes animals to the locomotor-stimulant
properties of cocaine. Analysis of nucleus accumbens tissue taken from rats
over-expressing DeltaFosB in the OFC and treated chronically with saline or
cocaine does not provide support for the hypothesis that increasing OFC DeltaFosB
potentiates sensitization via the nucleus accumbens. These data suggest that both
tolerance and sensitization to cocaine's many effects, although seemingly
opposing processes, can be induced in parallel via the same biological mechanism 
within the same brain region, and that drug-induced changes in gene expression
within the OFC play an important role in multiple aspects of addiction.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been proposed as a versatile class of molecules 
involved in regulation of various biological processes. Although there is
emerging evidence that some microRNAs can function as oncogenes or tumor
suppressors, the specific role of miRNA in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
is unclear at this point. In this study, we examined the microRNA expression
profiles in a set of 20 human HCC specimens by miRNA microarray and quantitative 
real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that among the 20 HCC
samples analyzed, microRNA-101 was significantly down-regulated twofold or more
(twofold to 20-fold) in 16 samples compared with the matching nontumoral liver
tissues. Using both a luciferase reporter assay and Western blot analysis, we
showed that microRNA-101 repressed the expression of v-fos FBJ murine
osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FOS) oncogene, a key component of the
activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor. Moreover, using a luciferase
expression vector (pAP-1-Luc) driven by seven copies of an AP-1 cis-element, we
observed that microRNA-101 expression inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(PMA)-induced AP-1 activity. In in vitro Matrigel invasion and Transwell
migration assays, enhanced microRNA-101 expression inhibited the invasion and
migration of cultured HCC cells, respectively. These findings suggest that
microRNA-101 may play an important role in HCC.CONCLUSION: MicroRNA-101, which is
aberrantly expressed in HCC, could repress the expression of the FOS oncogene.

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of single-dose and chronic
corticosterone treatment on the inducible transcription factor c-Fos and FosB,
and thereby to estimate the effects of high-doses of corticosterone on
calcium-dependent neuronal responses in the rat cerebral cortex. At the same time
we investigated the distribution of interneurons containing calretinin (CR),
vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) in chronically
treated animals in order to collect data on the involvement of inhibitory neurons
in this process. Adult male rats were injected subcutaneously with 10mg
corticosterone, whereas controls received the vehicle (sesame oil). The animals
were fixed by transcardial perfusion 12 and 24h following single corticosterone
injection, and the brains were processed for c-Fos and FosB immunohistochemistry.
To investigate the effects of repeated corticosterone administration, rats were
daily treated with the same amount of corticosterone (10mg/animal,
subcutaneously) for 21 days. Controls were injected with vehicle. At the end of
the experiment, the rats were perfused and immunohistochemistry was used to
detect the presence of the FosB protein, CR, VIP and NPY. Quantitative evaluation
of immunolabelled cells was performed in the neocortex and the hippocampus. The
number of immunoreactive nuclei per unit area was used as a quantitative measure 
of the effects of corticosterone. It was found that a single-dose administration 
of corticosterone resulted in a significant, time-dependent increase of c-Fos
protein immunoreactivity in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, as well 
as in regions CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus 12 and 24h post-injection with
respect to control animals. Significant enhancement of c-Fos immunoreactivity was
also observed in the neocortex at 12 and 24h post-injection. Single-dose
treatment did not significantly alter FosB immunolabelling. Repeated
administration of corticosterone produced a complex pattern of changes in FosB
immunolabelling: significant increase in FosB immunoreactivity was detected in
the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, with no significant changes in the
CA1 and CA3 layers of the hippocampus and in the neocortex. However, a
significant decrease of FosB induction in the neocortex was observed in
chronically treated rats in comparison to single-dose injected animals (12h
before immunohistochemistry). Analysis of immunohistochemical detection of
interneuronal markers revealed a significant reduction of the CR immunolabelling 
in the CA3 area of the hippocampus. No changes in VIP or NPY immunoreactivity
were found in the Ammon's horn 3 weeks following daily corticosterone treatment. 
NPY immunoreactivity was significantly attenuated in the neocortex. The present
data suggest that single-dose corticosterone treatment increases immunoreactivity
of c-Fos protein in a time-dependent manner, 12 and 24h post-injection in the rat
hippocampus and the neocortex, whereas chronic corticosterone treatment
influences FosB immunoreactivity, primarily in the dentate gyrus. Chronic
corticosterone administration seems to affect CR levels in the CA3 area of the
hippocampus.

A well-characterized murine osteosarcoma model for metastasis and invasion was
used in this study to determine the role of AP-1 in the progression of this
disease. We analyzed K12 and K7M2 cells, two clonally related murine osteosarcoma
cell lines that have been characterized as low metastatic or high metastatic,
respectively, for AP-1 components and activity. AP-1 DNA binding was similar
between the two cell lines; however AP-1 transcriptional activity was enhanced by
3- to 5-fold in K7M2 cells relative to that in K12 cells. The AP-1 complexes in
K12 and K7M2 cells was composed primarily of cJun, JunD, FosB, Fra1, and Fra2,
with the contribution of individual components in the complex varying between the
two cell lines. In addition, an increase in phosphorylated cJun, JNK activity,
and phosphorylated ERK1/2 was associated with the more metastatic osteosarcoma
phenotype. The significance of AP-1 activation was confirmed by conditional
expression of TAM67, a dominant negative mutant of cJun. Under conditions where
TAM67 inhibited AP-1 activity in K7M2 cells, migration and invasion potential was
significantly blocked. Tam67 expression in aggressive osteosarcoma cells
decreased long-term in vivo experimental metastasis and increased survival of
mice. This study shows that differences in metastatic activity can be due to AP-1
activation. The inhibition of AP-1 activity may serve as a therapeutic tool in
the management of osteosarcoma.

dyskinesias in parkinsonian rats is determined by the extent of dopamine neuron
degeneration.

Previous studies have shown that serotonin neurons play an important role in the 
induction and maintenance of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in animals with lesion of 
the nigrostriatal dopamine system. Patients with Parkinson's disease that receive
transplants of foetal ventral mesencephalic tissue, the graft cell preparation is
likely to contain, in addition to dopamine neurons, serotonin neurons that will
vary in number depending on the landmarks used for dissection. Here, we have
studied the impact of grafted serotonin neurons--alone or mixed with dopamine
neurons--on the development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in rats with a partial
6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the host nigrostriatal projection. In these rats,
which showed only low-level dyskinesia at the time of transplantation, serotonin 
grafts induced a worsening in the severity of dyskinesia that developed during
continued L-DOPA treatment, while the dopamine-rich graft had the opposite,
dampening effect. The detrimental effect seen in animals with serotonin neuron
grafts was dramatically increased when the residual dopamine innervation in the
striatum was removed by a second 6-hydroxydopamine lesion. Interestingly, rats
with grafts that contained a mixture of dopamine and serotonin neurons (in
approximately 2:1) showed a marked reduction in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia over
time, and the appearance of severe dyskinesia induced by the removal of the
residual dopamine innervation, seen in the animals with transplants of serotonin 
neurons alone, was blocked. FosB expression in the striatal projection neurons,
which is associated with dyskinesias, was also normalized by the dopamine-rich
grafts, but not by the serotonin neuron grafts. These data indicate that as long 
as a sufficient portion, some 10-20%, of the dopamine innervation still remains, 
the increased host serotonin innervation generated by the grafted serotonin
neurons will have limited effect on the development or severity of L-DOPA-induced
dyskinesias. At more advanced stages of the disease, when the dopamine
innervation of the putamen is reduced below this critical threshold, grafted
serotonin neurons are likely to aggravate l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in those
cases where the dopamine re-innervation derived from the grafted neurons is
insufficient in magnitude or do not cover the critical dyskinesia-inducing
sub-regions of the grafted putamen. We conclude that it is not the absolute
number of serotonin neurons in the grafts, but the relative densities of dopamine
and serotonin innervations in the grafted striatum that is the critical factor in
determining the long-term effect of foetal tissue graft, beneficial or
detrimental, on dyskinesia in grafted Parkinson's disease patients.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) are emerging as valuable new agents in the 
treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). However, since response rates to
these agents alone are low, we sought to identify markers associated with
responsiveness. In a trial of 20 patients treated with the HDI sodium valproate
(VPA) in combination with all trans retinoic acid and theophylline, three
patients responded clinically with one complete remission (CR) and two partial
remissions. The in vivo response of the CR patient was mirrored by high in vitro 
sensitivity of their blasts to VPA, indicating that similar factors determine
both in vivo and in vitro sensitivity. Microarray analysis of the primary AMLs
and a panel of haemato-lymphoid cell lines, with a similar range of VPA
sensitivities as the primary leukaemic blasts, identified elevated
FOSB-expression as a potential marker of VPA sensitivity. Quantitative polymerase
chain reaction confirmed overexpression of FOSB in the CR patient blasts compared
to patients failing to achieve CR, and in a subset of a larger panel of AML
samples. Overexpression of FOSB in K562 myeloid cells significantly increased in 
vitro sensitivity to VPA. Thus, we propose that FOSB is a novel, potential marker
of VPA sensitivity in AML.

OFF-L-dopa dyskinesias have been a surprising side-effect of intrastriatal foetal
ventral mesencephalic transplantation in patients with Parkinson's disease. It
has been proposed that excessive and unregulated dopaminergic stimulation of host
post-synaptic striatal neurons by the grafts could be responsible for these
dyskinesias. To address this issue we transplanted foetal dopaminergic neurons
from mice lacking the dopamine transporter (DATKO) or from wild-type mice, into a
rat model of Parkinson's disease and L-dopa-induced dyskinesias. Both wild-type
and DATKO grafts reinnervated the host striatum to a similar extent, but DATKO
grafts produced a greater and more diffuse increase in extra-cellular striatal
dopamine levels. Interestingly, grafts containing wild-type dopaminergic neurons 
improved parkinsonian signs to a similar extent as DATKO grafts, but provided a
more complete reduction of L-dopa induced dyskinesias. Neither DATKO nor
wild-type grafts induced OFF-L-dopa dyskinesias. Behavioural and receptor
autoradiography analyses demonstrated that DATKO grafts induced a greater
normalization of striatal dopaminergic receptor supersensitivity than wild-type
grafts. Both graft types induced a similar downregulation and normalization of
PEnk and fosb/Deltafosb in striatal neurons. In summary, DATKO grafts causing
high and diffuse extra-cellular dompamine levels do not per se alter
graft-induced recovery or produce OFF-L-dopa dyskinesias. Wild-type dopaminergic 
neurons appear to be the most effective neuronal type to restore function and
reduce L-dopa-induced dyskinesias.

Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is an extracellularly operating enzyme
involved in the synaptic plasticity, hippocampal-dependent long term memory and
neurodegeneration. Previous studies have shown its upregulation following
seizure-evoking stimuli. Herein, we show that in the rat brain, MMP-9 mRNA
expression in response to pentylenetetrazole-evoked neuronal depolarization is
transient. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the rat hippocampus neuronal
activation strongly induces JunB expression, simultaneously leading to an
accumulation of JunB/FosB complexes onto the -88/-80 bp site of the rat MMP-9
gene promoter in vivo. Surprisingly, manipulations with JunB expression levels in
activated neurons revealed its moderate repressive action onto MMP-9 gene
expression. Therefore, our study documents the active repressive influence of
AP-1 onto MMP-9 transcriptional regulation by the engagement of JunB.

RNA analysis has been applied to forensic work to determine wound age. We
investigated mRNA expression using quantitative RT-PCR of ten genes, including
c-fos, fosB, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), CD14,
chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 9 (CCL9), placenta growth factor (PlGF), mast cell
protease-5 (MCP-5), growth arrest specific 5 (Gas5), beta-2 microglobulin (B2M)
and major urinary protein-1 (MUP-1), in terms of repair response in adult mice.
The expression level of c-fos, fosB and MKP-1 transcripts increased drastically, 
peaked within 1h, and that of the CD14 and CCL9 transcripts peaked from 12 to
24h. An increase in PlGF and MCP-5 mRNA appeared on about day 5. Gas5, B2M and
MUP-1 transcripts showed no significant change. Each gene had differentially
expressional patterns with time-course. Our result implied that the observation
of the 7 genes in wounded skin could serve to aid in the accurate diagnosis of
wound age.

Appearance of dyskinesia is a common problem of long-term l-DOPA treatment in
Parkinson's disease patients and represents a major limitation for the
pharmacological management of the motor symptoms in advanced disease stages. We
have recently demonstrated that dopamine released from serotonin neurons is
responsible for l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned 
rats, raising the possibility that blockade of serotonin neuron activity by
combination of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) agonists could reduce l-DOPA-induced
dyskinesia. In the present study, we have investigated the efficacy of 5-HT(1A)
and 5-HT(1B) agonists to counteract l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in
1-methyl-4-phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated macaques, the gold
standard model of Parkinson's disease. In addition, we have studied the ability
of this treatment to prevent development of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in
6-OHDA-lesioned rats. The results demonstrate the existence of a potent
synergistic effect between 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) agonists in their ability to
dampen l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in the MPTP-treated macaques. Sub-threshold
doses of the drugs, which individually produced no effect, were able to reduce
the abnormal involuntary movements by up to 80% when administered in combination,
without affecting the anti-parkinsonian properties of l-DOPA. Furthermore,
chronic administration of low doses of the 5-HT(1) agonists in combination was
able to prevent development of dyskinesia, and reduce the up-regulation of FosB
after daily treatment with l-DOPA in the rat 6-OHDA model. Our results support
the importance of a clinical investigation of the effect of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B)
agonists, particularly in combination, in dyskinetic l-DOPA-treated Parkinson's
disease patients.

Members of the Fos protein family dimerise with Jun proteins to form the AP-1
transcription factor complex. They have a central function in proliferation and
differentiation of normal tissue as well as in oncogenic transformation and
tumour progression. We analysed the expression of c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1 and Fra-2 to
investigate the function of Fos transcription factors in ovarian cancer. A total 
of 101 patients were included in the study. Expression of Fos proteins was
determined by western blot analysis, quantified by densitometry and verified by
immunohistochemistry. Reduced c-Fos expression was independently associated with 
unfavourable progression-free survival (20.6, 31.6 and 51.2 months for patients
with low, moderate and high c-Fos expression; P=0.003) as well as overall
survival (23.8, 46.0 and 55.5 months for low, moderate and high c-Fos levels;
P=0.003). No correlations were observed for FosB, Fra-1 and Fra-2. We conclude
that loss of c-Fos expression is associated with tumour progression in ovarian
carcinoma and that c-Fos may be a prognostic factor. These results are in
contrast to the classic concept of c-Fos as an oncogene, but are supported by the
recently discovered tumour-suppressing and proapoptotic function of c-Fos in
various cancer types.

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) plays an important role in chromatin remodeling in
response to a variety of neurochemical signalings and behavioral manipulations,
and may be a therapeutic target for modulation of psychostimulant behavioral
sensitization. In this study, we investigated the molecular interaction between
histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) and psychostimulant in vivo of mice after
repeated treatment with the HDACi, butyric acid (BA) and valproic acid (VPA),
alone or in combination with amphetamine. Repeated treatment with amphetamine
produced HDACi-like effects: enhanced global histone H4 acetylation level by
Western blot as well as specific histone H4 acetylation associated with fosB
promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation in the striatum. Conversely, repeated
treatment with BA or VPA produced amphetamine-like effects: enhanced cAMP
responsive element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation at Ser(133) position
and increased DeltaFosB protein levels in the striatum. Furthermore,
co-administration of BA or VPA with amphetamine produced additive effects on
histone H4 acetylation as well as CREB phosphorylation in the striatum. The
interplay of HDAC and CREB was also supported by co-immunoprecipitation assays
demonstrating that repeated treatment with VPA reduced the association of CREB
and HDAC1 in the striatum. Finally, the additive effect of VPA/BA and amphetamine
on histone H4 acetylation, phosphorylated CREB, and DeltaFosB was associated with
potentiated amphetamine-induced locomotor activity. Thus, HDACi may interact
additively with psychostimulants at both histone acetylation and CREB
phosphorylation through the CREB:HDAC protein complex in the striatum to modulate
DeltaFosB protein levels and psychomotor behavioral sensitization.

The transcription factor deltaFosB (DeltaFosB), induced in nucleus accumbens
(NAc) by chronic exposure to drugs of abuse, has been shown to mediate sensitized
responses to these drugs. However, less is known about a role for DeltaFosB in
regulating responses to natural rewards. Here, we demonstrate that two powerful
natural reward behaviors, sucrose drinking and sexual behavior, increase levels
of DeltaFosB in the NAc. We then use viral-mediated gene transfer to study how
such DeltaFosB induction influences behavioral responses to these natural
rewards. We demonstrate that overexpression of DeltaFosB in the NAc increases
sucrose intake and promotes aspects of sexual behavior. In addition, we show that
animals with previous sexual experience, which exhibit increased DeltaFosB
levels, also show an increase in sucrose consumption. This work suggests that
DeltaFosB is not only induced in the NAc by drugs of abuse, but also by natural
rewarding stimuli. Additionally, our findings show that chronic exposure to
stimuli that induce DeltaFosB in the NAc can increase consumption of other
natural rewards.

Cocaine is an addictive psychostimulant that induces immediate early gene (IEG)
expression by activating dopamine (DA) D1 and glutamate NMDA receptors in the
striatum. In this study, we show that a single cocaine administration (30 mg/kg) 
time-dependently increases ERK phosphorylation, c-Fos and FosB protein
expression, and MKP-1 phosphorylation (p-MKP-1), in the caudate-putamen (CPu) and
nucleus accumbens (NAc) of Fischer rats. In the CPu, 1 h after cocaine injection,
the increase in c-Fos and FosB protein expressions is totally abolished by
pre-administration of DA-D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390. In the NAc, SCH23390
also inhibits cocaine-induced c-Fos protein expression. The pre-treatment of NMDA
receptor antagonist, MK801, partially reduces cocaine-activated c-Fos protein
expression in the CPu. Furthermore, the escalation of p-MKP-1 after acute cocaine
administration is dependent on both DA-D1 and NMDA receptor activation in both
brain regions examined. Our data suggest that cocaine may modulate ERK pathway
signaling through the activation of DA-D1 and NMDA receptors, subsequently
influencing the IEG protein expression.

c-Fos proto-oncoprotein defines a family of closely related transcription factors
(Fos proteins) also comprising Fra-1, Fra-2, FosB and DeltaFosB, the latter two
proteins being generated by alternative splicing. Through the regulation of many 
genes, most of them still unidentified, they regulate major functions from the
cell level up to the whole organism. Thus they are involved in the control of
proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, as well as in the control of
responses to stresses, and they play important roles in organogenesis, immune
responses and control of cognitive functions, among others. Fos proteins are
intrinsically unstable. We have studied how two of them, c-Fos and Fra-1, are
degraded. Departing from the classical scenario where unstable key cell
regulators are hydrolysed by the proteasome after polyubiquitination, we showed
that the bulk of c-Fos and Fra-1 can be broken down independently of any prior
ubiquitination. Certain conserved structural domains suggest that similar
mechanisms may also apply to Fra-2 and FosB. Computer search indicates that
certain motifs shared by the Fos proteins and putatively responsible for
instability are found in no other protein, suggesting the existence of
degradation mechanisms specific for this protein family. Under particular
signalling conditions, others have shown that a part of cytoplasmic c-Fos
requires ubiquitination for fast turnover. This poses the question of the
multiplicity of degradation pathways that apply to proteins depending on their
intracellular localization.

transcription factor, under the control of the enolase 2 (ENO2) promoter exhibit 
both an increase in bone density and a decrease in adipose mass. Here we
demonstrate that DeltaFosB overexpression increases fatty-acid oxidation and
energy expenditure, leading to a decrease in adipocyte size and adipose mass. In 
addition, the ENO2-DeltaFosB mice exhibit increased insulin sensitivity and
glucose tolerance. Targeted overexpression of DeltaFosB in adipocytes using the
adipocyte protein 2 promoter failed to induce changes in fat or in bone, showing 
that the effect on metabolic activity is not due to cell-autonomous effects of
DeltaFosB within adipocytes. Detailed analysis of the ENO2-DeltaFosB mice
demonstrated that energy expenditure was increased in muscle, independent of
locomotor activity. These findings provide evidence that signaling downstream of 
DeltaFosB is a potential target for not only osteoporosis but also obesity and
diabetes.

L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) is among the motor complications that arise in
Parkinson patients after a prolonged treatment with levodopa (L-DOPA). Since
previous transcriptome and proteomic studies performed in the rat model of LID
suggested important changes in striatal energy-related components, we hypothesize
that oral creatine supplementation could prevent or attenuate the occurrence of
LID. In this study, 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats received a 2%
creatine-supplemented diet for 1 month prior to L-DOPA therapy. During the 21
days of L-DOPA treatment, significant reductions in abnormal involuntary
movements (AIMs) have been observed in the creatine-supplemented group, without
any worsening of parkinsonism. In situ hybridization histochemistry and
immunohistochemistry analysis of the striatum also showed a reduction in the
levels of prodynorphin mRNA and FosB/DeltaFosB-immunopositive cells in
creatine-supplemented diet group, an effect that was dependant on the development
of AIMs. Further investigation of the bioenergetics' status of the denervated
striatum revealed significant changes in the levels of creatine both after L-DOPA
alone and with the supplemented diet. In conclusion, we demonstrated that
combining L-DOPA therapy with a diet enriched in creatine could attenuate LID,
which may represent a new way to control the motor complications associated with 
L-DOPA therapy.

Spatiotemporal pattern of striatal ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a rat model of
L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and the role of dopamine D1 receptors.

Science, Lund University, Sweden.

BACKGROUND: We examined the activation pattern of extracellular signal-regulated 
kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and its dependence on D1 versus D2 dopamine receptors in 
hemiparkinsonian rats treated with 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (L-DOPA).
METHODS: 6-Hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats were treated acutely or chronically with
L-DOPA in combination with antagonists for D1 or D2 receptors. Development of
dyskinesia was monitored in animals receiving chronic drug treatment.
Phosphorylation of ERK1/2, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1
(MSK-1), and the levels of FosB/DeltaFosB expression were examined
immunohistochemically.
RESULTS: L-DOPA treatment caused phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the
dopamine-denervated striatum after acute and chronic administration. Similar
levels were observed in matrix and striosomes, and in enkephalin-positive and
dynorphin-positive neurons. The severity of dyskinesia was positively correlated 
with phospho-ERK1/2 levels. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and MSK-1 was
dose-dependently blocked by SCH23390, but not by raclopride. SCH23390 also
inhibited the development of dyskinesia and the induction of FosB/DeltaFosB.
CONCLUSIONS: L-DOPA produces pronounced activation of ERK1/2 signaling in the
dopamine-denervated striatum through a D1-receptor-dependent mechanism. This
effect is associated with the development of dyskinesia. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 is
localized to both dynorphinergic and enkephalinergic striatal neurons, suggesting
a general role of ERK1/2 as a plasticity molecule during L-DOPA treatment.

Erratum in
    Neuron. 2007 Nov 8;56(3):574.

We analyzed the influence of the transcription factor DeltaFosB on learned
helplessness, an animal model of affective disorder wherein a subset of mice
exposed to inescapable stress (IS) develop a deficit in escape behavior. Repeated
IS induces DeltaFosB in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), and levels
of the protein are highly predictive of an individual's subsequent behavorial
deficit-with the strongest DeltaFosB induction observed in the most resilient
animals. Induction of DeltaFosB by IS predominates in substance P-positive
neurons in the vlPAG, and the substance P gene, a direct target for DeltaFosB, is
downregulated upon DeltaFosB induction. Local overexpression of DeltaFosB in the 
vlPAG using viral-mediated gene transfer dramatically reduces depression-like
behaviors and inhibits stress-induced release of substance P. These results
indicate that IS-induced accumulation of DeltaFosB in the vlPAG desensitizes
substance P neurons enriched in this area and opposes behavioral despair by
promoting active defense responses.

Identification of rat brainstem neuronal structures activated during
cancer-induced anorexia.

Ruud J(1), Blomqvist A.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Cell Biology, Department of Biomedicine and Surgery, Faculty of
Health Sciences, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.

In cancer-related anorexia, body weight loss is paradoxically associated with
reduced appetite, which is contrary to the situation during starvation, implying 
that the normal coupling of food intake to energy expenditure is disarranged.
Here we examined brainstem mechanisms that may underlie suppression of food
intake in a rat model of cancer anorexia. Cultured Morris 7777 hepatoma cells
were injected subcutaneously in Buffalo rats, resulting in slowly growing tumor
and reduced food intake and body weight loss after about 10 days. The brainstem
was examined for induced expression of the transcription factors Fos and FosB as 
signs of neuronal activation. The results showed that anorexia and retarded body 
weight growth were associated with Fos protein expression in the area postrema,
the general visceral region of the nucleus of the solitary tract, and the
external lateral parabrachial nucleus, structures that also display Fos after
peripheral administration of satiating or anorexigenic stimuli. The magnitude of 
the Fos expression was specifically related to the size of induced tumor, and not
associated with weight loss per se, because it was not present in pair-fed or
food-deprived rats. It also appeared to be independent of proinflammatory
cytokines, as determined by the absence of increased cytokine levels in plasma
and induced cytokine and cyclooxygenase expression in the brain. The findings
thus provide evidence that cancer-associated anorexia and weight loss in this
model is associated with activation of brainstem circuits involved in the
suppression of food intake, and suggest that this occurs by
inflammatory-independent mechanisms.

Microinjection of M(5) muscarinic receptor antisense oligonucleotide into VTA
inhibits FosB expression in the NAc and the hippocampus of heroin sensitized
rats.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of M(5) muscarinic receptor subtype on the
locomotor sensitization induced by heroin priming, and it's effect on the FosB
expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the hippocampus in the heroin
sensitized rats.
METHODS: Locomotor activity was measured every 10 min for 1 h after subcutaneous 
injection of heroin. FosB expression was assayed by immunohistochemistry, and the
antisense oligonucleotides (AS-ONs) targeting M(5) muscarinic receptor was
transferred with the lipofectin.
RESULTS: Microinjection of AS-ONs targeting M(5) muscarinic receptor in the
ventral tegmental area (VTA) blocked the expression of behavioral sensitization
induced by heroin priming in rats. Meanwhile, the expression of FosB-positive
neurons in either the NAc or the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus increased 
in heroin-induced locomotor sensitized rats. The enhancement of FosB-positive
neurons in the NAc or DG could be inhibited by microinjection of M(5) muscarinic 
receptor AS-ONs into the VTA before the heroin-induced locomotor sensitization
was performed. In contrast, microinjection of M(5) muscarinic receptor sense
oligonucleotide (S-ONs) into the VTA did not block the expression of behavioral
sensitization or the expression of FosB in the NAc or DG in the heroin sensitized
rats.
CONCLUSION: Blocking M(5) muscarinic receptor in the VTA inhibits the expression 
of heroin-induced locomotor sensitization, which is associated with the
regulation of FosB expression in the NAc and hippocampus neurons. M(5) muscarinic
receptor may be a useful pharmacological target for the treatment of heroin
addiction.

The transcription factor, DeltaFosB, a splice isoform of fosB, accumulates in
rodents in a brain-region-specific manner in response to chronic administration
of drugs of abuse, stress, certain antipsychotic or antidepressant medications,
electroconvulsive seizures, and certain lesions. Increasing evidence supports a
functional role of such DeltaFosB induction in animal models of several
psychiatric and neurologic disorders. Fos family proteins, including DeltaFosB,
are known to heterodimerize with Jun family proteins to create active AP-1
transcription-factor complexes, which bind to DNA specifically at AP-1 consensus 
sites. We show here, using a range of biochemical and biophysical means, that
recombinant, purified DeltaFosB forms homodimers as well, at concentrations less 
than 500 nM, and that these homodimers specifically bind to DNA oligonucleotides 
containing AP-1 consensus sequences in the absence of any Jun partner. Our
results suggest that, as DeltaFosB accumulates to abnormally elevated protein
levels in highly specific regions of the brain in response to chronic
stimulation, functional homodimers of DeltaFosB are formed with the potential to 
uniquely regulate patterns of gene expression and thereby contribute to the
complex processes of neural and behavioral adaptation.

Transcription factor DeltaFosB has been implicated in the psychomotor responses
and rewarding effects of drugs of abuse. In the present study, we compared the
effects of cocaine on the expression of DeltaFosB-like proteins by
immunohistochemistry in striatal brain areas of alcohol-preferring (AA) and
alcohol-avoiding (ANA) rats. Cocaine was administered using a previously verified
treatment paradigm that sensitized the locomotor response to cocaine in AA but
not in ANA rats. We also studied the rewarding effects of cocaine with a
conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm in both lines of rats. Cocaine
treatment increased the FosB/DeltaFosB immunoreactivity (IR) in the nucleus
accumbens of AA rats but not in ANA rats. In addition, after repeated saline
injections the accumbal FosB/DeltaFosB IR was significantly greater in
saline-injected AA rats than in ANA rats. In the caudate-putamen cocaine
significantly increased FosB/DeltaFosB IR, but no differences were found between 
the rats of two lines. In the CPP experiment, AA rats treated with cocaine 2.5
mg/kg preferred the cocaine-associated compartment, in contrast to ANA rats,
which did not show such a preference. In conclusion, our findings show that AA
rats are more sensitive to cocaine than ANA rats, and suggest that one possible
mediator for this increased sensitivity could be the increased expression of
fosB-derived proteins in the nucleus accumbens of AA rats.

Long-term behavioural and molecular alterations associated with maternal
separation in rats.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Psychiatry, The University of Texas South-western Medical
Center, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX 75390-9070, USA.

In this study we addressed whether certain behavioural measures, endocrine levels
and specific stress-related proteins exhibit long-term alterations in adult rats 
following repeated postnatal maternal separation. Rats were subjected to daily
maternal separation for 15 min (HMS15) or 180 min (HMS180) from postnatal day
2-14. Adult HMS180 animals were hypoactive and had increased levels of stereotypy
compared to HMS15 and normal animal facility-reared (AFR) animals. HMS180 animals
also had augmented plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone (CORT)
concentrations following an acute stressor, compared to the other two groups. We 
assessed persistent changes in proteins regulated by stress in hippocampus,
cortex, ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, striatum and amygdala. Western
blotting analysis revealed a decrease in the levels of mature brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in hippocampus and striatum, but an increase in the
ventral tegmental area in the HMS180 rats. Levels of pro-BDNF were significantly 
increased in the ventral tegmental area of HMS180 animals but were unchanged in
other brain regions compared to the other two groups. Levels of the transcription
factors cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and DeltaFosB were unchanged
in all of the brain regions studied in the maternally separated rats. These data 
show that maternal separation induces long-term changes in BDNF expression, and
more specifically the processing of BDNF, in the hippocampus, striatum and
ventral tegmental area. Recognition of these adaptations begins to define the
brain regions, and neural circuitry, associated with persistent alterations
induced by early life stressors and the development of mood disorders.

Proteasome-dependent and -independent mechanisms for FosB destabilization:

The transcription factor DeltaFosB (Delta FosB) accumulates in a region-specific 
manner in the brain during chronic exposure to stress, drugs of abuse or other
chronic stimuli. Once induced, DeltaFosB persists in the brain for at least
several weeks following cessation of the chronic stimulus. The biochemical basis 
of the persistent expression of DeltaFosB has remained unknown. Here, we show
that the FosB C-terminus, absent in DeltaFosB as a result of alternative
splicing, contains two degron domains. Pulse-chase experiments of C-terminal
truncation mutants of full-length FosB indicate that removal of its most
C-terminal degron increases its half-life approximately fourfold, and prevents
its proteasome-mediated degradation and ubiquitylation, properties similar to
DeltaFosB. In addition, removal of a second degron domain, which generates
DeltaFosB, further stabilizes FosB approximately twofold, but in a
proteasome-independent manner. These data indicate that alternative splicing
specifically removes two destabilizing elements from FosB in order to generate a 
longer-lived transcription factor, DeltaFosB, in response to chronic
perturbations to the brain.

Elevations of FosB in the nucleus accumbens during forced cocaine abstinence

Dysregulation of hedonic processing, in which seeking of drug reward becomes more
desirable than seeking natural rewards, like food, sex, and novelty, is a
consequence of chronic drug exposure and potentially leads to escalating drug
usage and addiction. Here, we investigated the effects of chronic cocaine
treatment (10 days of escalating doses of cocaine, 10-30 mg/kg) and multiple
forced abstinence periods (2, 3 or 5 weeks) on the acute rewarding properties of 
either cocaine (10 mg/kg) or novel-objects using the conditioned place preference
procedure. Following all cocaine withdrawal periods, cocaine preference was
significantly elevated while novel object preference was abolished compared with 
saline-treated rats. At the earliest withdrawal period, these behavioral changes 
were accompanied by elevations in FosB-like immunoreactive staining in the
basolateral amygdala (BLA) and nucleus accumbens shell (NAc-Sh) and core (NAc-C).
FosB staining in all three brain areas correlated positively with cocaine
preference, but negatively with novelty preference. After 5 weeks of withdrawal, 
FosB staining was only elevated in the NAc-Sh and again correlated positively
with elevated cocaine preference but negatively with decreased novelty
preference. These data indicate that alterations in the expression of FosB-like
transcription factors in the NAc can predict the dysregulation of hedonic
processing that occurs during protracted withdrawal from cocaine.

Chronic SKF83959 induced less severe dyskinesia and attenuated L-DOPA-induced
dyskinesia in 6-OHDA-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease.

SKF83959, a recently identified selective agonist of putative
phosphoinositide-linked (PI-linked) D(1) dopamine (DA) receptor, is found to
elicit excellent anti-parkinsonism effects in monkeys and rodents. In the present
study, the effects of SKF83959 on L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced
dyskinesia (LID) were assessed in a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)
lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD). The results indicated that
chronic L-DOPA (6 mg/kg) induced a progressive dyskinesia-like behavior in PD
rats, whereas SKF83959 (0.5 mg/kg) elicited significantly less severe dyskinesia 
while exerts its anti-parkinsonian action effectively. Application of D(1)
receptor, but not D(2), alpha or 5-HT receptor antagonist attenuated
SKF83959-induced dyskinesia, indicating that a D(1) receptor-mediated events,
assumed via PI-linked D(1) receptor. Interestingly, chronic co-administration of 
SKF83959 significantly reduced LID at no expanse of reduction in the
anti-parkinsonian potency in PD rats. However, this anti-dyskinesia effect was
not observed while SKF83959 was acutely administered in rats with established
LID. This implies that chronic SKF83959 attenuated the development of dyskinesia.
Immediate early gene FosB is previously reported to positively associate with
dyskinesia. However, we found that the anti-dyskinesia effect of chronic SKF83959
was independent of FosB since SKF83959 produced stronger FosB expression in the
lesioned striatum than that of L-DOPA while exerting its anti-dyskinesia action. 
The present data demonstrated that SKF83959 reduces LID by attenuating the
development of dyskinesia; the underlying signaling pathway for the
anti-dyskinesia action of SKF83959 appears not to depend on FosB.

Distribution of cells expressing Jun and Fos proteins and synthesizing DNA in the
adrenal cortex of hypophysectomized rats: regulation by ACTH and FGF2.

Torres TE(1), Lotfi CF.

Author information:

Paulo, São Paulo 05508-900, SP, Brazil.

Protein expression of the early response genes, jun and fos, has been suggested
to play an important role in the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of adrenal
cells. To elucidate the immunolocalization of proliferative cells and the
patterns of adrenal gland expression of members of the activating protein-1
(AP-1) family of oncogenes, we used hypophysectomized rats. The effects of
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) on Fos
and Jun protein expression were investigated, and DNA synthesis was assessed by
using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. No change was detectable in the
adrenal cortex at 2 days after hypophysectomy, although a reduction occurred in
the number of BrdU-positive cells in the zona fasciculata. This
hypophysectomy-induced early phase of adrenal cortex atrophy in the zona
fasciculata was correlated with JunB protein induction, suggesting the formation 
of an inhibitory AP-1 complex. Accumulation of c-Jun/JunD and c-Fos/FosB, but not
of JunB, in the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis implied that, after ACTH
stimulation, these proteins were the principal AP-1 components in these zones. In
these same zones, ACTH increased BrdU-positive cell counts, indicating that the
composition of the AP-1 complex in these zones was proliferation-related.
However, FGF2 induced an antagonistic modulation of the response to ACTH, by
reducing the numbers of Jun-/Fos-positive cells and inhibiting DNA synthesis. Our
results implicate the AP-1 family of transcription factors (in particular, the
dynamics within the Jun protein family) in the regulation of cell control during 
ACTH-induced proliferation of the adrenal cortex.

Synergistic activation of the tumor suppressor, HLJ1, by the transcription
factors YY1 and activator protein 1.

Wang CC(1), Tsai MF, Dai TH, Hong TM, Chan WK, Chen JJ, Yang PC.

Author information: 
(1)NTU Center for Genomic Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan,
Republic of China.

HLJ1 is a novel tumor and invasion suppressor that inhibits tumorigenesis and
cancer metastasis. However, the mechanism of HLJ1 activation is currently
unclear. Here, we identify an enhancer segment in the HLJ1 gene at -2,125 to
-1,039 bp upstream of the transcription start site. A 50-bp element between
-1,492 and -1,443 bp is the minimal enhancer segment, which includes the
activator protein 1 (AP-1) site (-1,457 to -1,451 bp), an essential regulatory
domain that binds the transcriptional factors FosB, JunB, and JunD. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays confirm that these AP-1 family members bind to a
specific site in the HLJ1 enhancer segment in vivo. Overexpression of either YY1 
at promoter or AP-1 at enhancer results in a 3-fold increase in the
transcriptional activity of HLJ1. We propose a novel mechanism whereby expression
of the tumor suppressor, HLJ1, is up-regulated via enhancer AP-1 binding to
promoter YY1 and the coactivator, p300, through DNA bending and multiprotein
complex formation. The combined expression of AP-1 and YY1 enhances HLJ1
expression by more than five times and inhibits in vitro cancer cell invasion.
Elucidation of the regulatory mechanism of HLJ1 expression may facilitate the
development of personalized therapy by inhibiting cancer cell proliferation,
angiogenesis, and metastasis.

Chronic 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine treatment induces dyskinesia in aphakia mice,

L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) is one of the main limitations of long term
L-DOPA use in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. We show that chronic L-DOPA
treatment induces novel dyskinetic behaviors in aphakia mouse with selective
nigrostriatal deficit mimicking PD. The stereotypical abnormal involuntary
movements were induced by dopamine receptor agonists and attenuated by
antidyskinetic agents. The development of LID was accompanied by preprodynorphin 
and preproenkephalin expression changes in the denervated dorsal striatum.
Increased FosB-expression was also noted in the dorsal striatum. In addition,
FosB expression was noted in the pedunculopontine nucleus and the zona incerta,
structures previously not examined in the setting of LID. The aphakia mouse is a 
novel genetic model with behavioral and biochemical characteristics consistent
with those of PD dyskinesia and provides a more consistent, convenient, and
physiologic model than toxic lesion models to study the mechanism of LID and to
test therapeutic approaches for LID.

Proinflammatory cytokines induce both sickness behavior and depression, but their
respective neurobiological correlates are still poorly understood. The aim of the
present study was therefore to identify in mice the neural substrates of sickness
and depressive-like behavior induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 830 microg/kg,
intraperitoneal). LPS-induced depressive-like behavior was dissociated from
LPS-induced sickness by testing mice either at 6 h (at which time sickness was
expected to be maximal) or at 24 h post-LPS (at which time sickness was expected 
to be minimal and not to bias the measurement of depressive-like behavior).
Concurrently, the expression of acute and chronic cellular reactivity markers
(c-Fos and FosB/DeltaFosB, respectively) was mapped by immunohistochemistry at
these two time points. In comparison to saline, LPS decreased motor activity in a
new cage at 6 h but not at 24 h. In contrast, the duration of immobility in the
tail suspension test was increased at both 6 and 24 h. This dissociation between 
decreased motor activity and depressive-like behavior was confirmed at 24 h
post-LPS in the forced swim test. LPS also decreased sucrose consumption at 24
and 48 h, despite normal food and water consumption by that time. At 24 h
post-LPS, LPS-induced depressive-like behavior was associated with a delayed
cellular activity (as assessed by FosB/DeltaFosB immunostaining) in specific
brain structures, particularly within the extended amygdala, hippocampus and
hypothalamus, whereas c-Fos labeling was markedly decreased by that time in all
the brain areas at 6 h post-LPS. These results provide the first evidence in
favor of a functional dissociation between the brain structures that underlie
cytokine-induced sickness behavior and cytokine-induced depressive-like behavior,
and provide important cues about the neuroanatomical brain circuits through which

Pleiotropic impact of constitutive fosB inactivation on nicotine-induced
behavioral alterations and stress-related traits in mice.

Sciences, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461, USA.

Multiple genes are thought to influence both susceptibility to nicotine
dependence and its comorbid behavioral traits in humans. However, which specific 
genes contribute to this pleiotropic effect is poorly understood. Previous rodent
studies have shown that many addictive substances and stressful stimuli increase 
the expression of the transcription factor FosB in limbic and associated regions 
and that the protein products of fosB contribute to certain behavioral effects of
cocaine and morphine. However, the role of this gene in nicotine-regulated
behaviors and dependence-related behavioral traits is unknown. We tested the
hypothesis that a constitutive level of FosB affects nicotine-regulated behaviors
and comorbid behavioral traits using constitutive fosB knockout (KO) mice.
Following repeated or prolonged nicotine administration, but not a single acute
administration, KO mice were impaired in conditioned place preference, oral
nicotine intake and motor suppression. In wild-type mice, repeated nicotine
injections, but not a single acute injection, increased the expression of FosB
and its truncated variant DeltaFosB in the targets but not at the origins of the 
mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopamine pathways; no detectable level of
FosB/DeltaFosB was found in KO mice. In tasks designed to assess behavioral
traits, KO mice exhibited more pronounced behavioral abnormalities when stress
levels were high than when they were minimized. Our results suggest that the
constitutive absence of fosB has a pleiotropic influence on the behavioral
effects of repeated or prolonged nicotine administration and on stress-related
behavioral traits in mice.

We examined the effects of inhalative exposure to formaldehyde (FA, 400 ppb) on
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits (NR2A and NR2B), dopamine receptor 
subtypes (D1 and D2), cyclic AMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-1,
CREB-2, FosB/DeltaFosB, and transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor
(TRPV1) in the hippocampus of ovalbumin-immunized mice using quantitative
real-time PCR. Western blot analyses for pCREB were performed. The mRNA levels of
NR2A, D1 and D2 receptors, and CREB-1 were significantly increased by FA, but
NR2B, CREB-2, FosB/DeltaFosB, and TRPV1 mRNA levels remained unchanged. Treatment
with MK-801 normalized the mRNA levels induced by FA. There was no significant
effect of FA exposure and MK-801 treatment on the protein level of pCREB. These
results indicate that FA exposure selectively up-regulates hippocampal gene
expression in immunologically sensitized mice. The FA effects are presumably
mediated by glutamatergic neurotransmission through NMDA receptors.

Type 1 sphingosine 1-phosphate G protein-coupled receptor (S1P1) mediation of
enhanced IL-4 generation by CD4 T cells from S1P1 transgenic mice.

Wang W(1), Huang MC, Goetzl EJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine and Department of Microbiology-Immunology, University
of California, San Francisco, CA 94143.

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a natural lipid mediator that regulates immune
cell traffic, Ab production, and T cell cytokine generation by mechanisms that
enhance Th2 activities. Responses to S1P are controlled principally by the
diverse expression patterns of its receptors in different cells. In T cells, the 
type 1 (S1P(1)) and type 4 (S1P(4)) G protein-coupled receptors are predominant. 
S1P(1) mainly transduces effects on T cell migration and trafficking, whereas
S1P(4) transduces immunosuppression via its effects on T cell proliferation and
cytokine production. Using T cell-specific S1P(1) transgenic (TG) mice, we
investigated the regulatory effects of the S1P-S1P(1) axis on T cell cytokine
production. The production of IL-4, but not IL-2 or IFN-gamma, was significantly 
up-regulated >10-fold in activated CD4 T cells from S1P(1) TG mice compared with 
those from wild-type mice. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that IL-4
up-regulation was initiated at the mRNA level as early as 4 h after T cell
activation. The up-regulation of IL-4 mRNA was mediated by c-Maf, Jun B, and
Gata3 as demonstrated by increases in their protein expression and DNA-binding
activities. In contrast, the expression and DNA-binding activities of T-bet,
FosB, C-Fos, Jun D, Fra-1, Fra-2, and c-Jun all were identical in wild-type and
TG CD4 T cells. Immunological assays showed that increased IL-4 levels induced
greater production of IgE. Thus, the S1P-S1P(1) axis specifically up-regulates
c-Maf, Jun B, and Gata3, which consequently enhance IL-4 production that may lead
to a Th2 phenotype.

Latent membrane protein 1-induced EGFR signalling is negatively regulated by TGF 
alpha prior to neoplasia.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Molecular Genetics, Biomedical and Life Sciences, University of
Glasgow, Glasgow G11 6NU, UK.

The latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an
oncoprotein expressed in several EBV-associated malignancies. We have utilised
mice expressing the Cao strain of LMP1 in epithelia to explore the consequences
of expression in vivo, specifically the changes that occur prior to neoplasia, in
the hyperplastic but degenerating tissue. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
ligands (transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha), heparin-binding EGF-like
growth factor and epiregulin) are constitutively induced by LMP1, leading to EGFR
phosphorylation but also down-regulation, degradation or turn-over, with the
appearance of cleaved EGFR fragments. This is accompanied by down-regulation of
Akt and activation of caspase-3 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). 
Surprisingly, removal of TGFalpha (using the null strain) does not ameliorate the
LMP1-induced phenotype, but instead accelerates the deterioration. Consistent
with this, EGFR is reduced less rapidly and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) and
extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) are initially activated in the null
background, suggesting that TGFalpha or excess of the ligands together act to
divert phosphorylated EGFR into a cleavage pathway. In addition, LMP1 leads to
the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) followed by JNK1 in the
effected tissue. Specific AP1 family members FosB, Fra-1 and JunB are
constitutively induced and serum response factor, AP1 and nuclear factor kappaB
(incorporating p65) are activated in the transgenic tissue compared with
wild-type. This system allows the analysis of early events resulting from the
expression of a viral oncogene with broad impact in the signalling milieu and the
attempts at homeostasis in the responding tissue. It reveals what regulatory
circuits are in place in a normal tissue, thus facilitating further prediction of
causative events in carcinogenic progression.

brain regions during both peri- and post-adolescence.

INTRODUCTION: Periadolescent nicotine exposure is associated with increased
consumption and rewarding properties of abused drugs. In the case of peri- but
not post-adolescent animals, these effects are persistent and last to adulthood, 
suggesting that early nicotine treatment may alter postnatal CNS development in
ways that contribute to long-term problems with drug abuse.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To begin to identify brain regions that may be altered by 
developmental nicotine exposure, we have measured expression of a transcription
factor, FosB, within a series of reward- and memory-related brain regions of
Sprague-Dawley rats.
RESULTS: FosB expression is known to acutely and cumulatively increase within a
subset of brain regions, particularly nucleus accumbens, after exposure to many
classes of abused drugs. Our results demonstrate that FosB is increased within
nucleus accumbens and also the granule cell layer of hippocampal dentate gyrus
after both peri- and post-adolescent nicotine exposure (0.4 mg kg(-1) day(-1)
from days 34 to 43 and 60 to 69, respectively). In periadolescents, expression
increases were detected 2 days after nicotine exposure, and persisted for weeks, 
through at least early adulthood at 80 days of age. In post-adolescents,
expression increases persisted for at least 11 days to postnatal day 80.
DISCUSSION: These findings demonstrate that nicotine treatment during both peri- 
and post-adolescence persistently alters activity of brain regions involved in
reward and memory.
CONCLUSION: Because this altered gene expression occurs after both peri- and
post-adolescent treatment, it cannot be directly responsible for increased
consumption and rewarding properties of abused drugs previously established to be
distinctly associated with periadolescent nicotine exposure.

Effects of enriched environment on morphine-induced reward in mice.

Xu Z(1), Hou B, Gao Y, He F, Zhang C.

Author information:

Drug addiction and abuse have been extremely serious problems in our society. The
effect of different environmental conditions on the susceptibility of human to
drug addiction and abuse is still not fully understood. It was recently reported 
that enriched environment can trigger long-term modification in neural functions 
and might prevent the occurrence of pathogenic behaviors. Here we investigated
the effects of enriched environment on morphine-induced reward in mice. We found 
that the enriched environment attenuated the acute morphine (10 mg/kg)-induced
hyperlocomotion and repeated morphine (10 mg/kg)-induced behavioral
sensitization. Moreover, the environmental condition blocked the conditioned
place preference (CPP) of the mice induced by morphine (5 mg/kg). Associated with
behavioral alterations, the expression of FosB-like proteins in the nucleus
accumbens of the brain was down-regulated in the mice housed in the enriched
environmental condition, but not in the standard environment. Taken together,
these results indicate that enriched environmental condition leads to decrease in
sensitivity of the mice to morphine-induced reward.

This study examined the cellular changes produced in the striatum by chronic
L-DOPA treatment and prolonged subthalamic nucleus high-frequency stimulation
(STN-HFS) applied separately, successively, or in association, in the
6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Only animals
showing severe L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) were included, and STN-HFS was
applied for 5 d at an intensity efficient for alleviating akinesia without
inducing dyskinesias. L-DOPA treatment alone induced FosB/deltaFosB
immunoreactivity, exacerbated the postlesional increase in preproenkephalin,
reversed the decrease in preprotachykinin, and markedly increased mRNA levels of 
preprodynorphin and of the glial glutamate transporter GLT1, which were
respectively decreased and unaffected by the dopamine lesion. STN-HFS did not
affect per se the postlesion changes in any of these markers. However, when
applied in association with L-DOPA treatment, it potentiated the positive
modulation exerted by L-DOPA on all of the markers examined and tended to
exacerbate LIDs. After 5 d of L-DOPA withdrawal, the only persisting drug-induced
responses were an elevation in preprodynorphin mRNA levels and in the number of
FosB/deltaFosB-immunoreactive neurons. Selective additional increases in these
two markers were measured when STN-HFS was applied subsequently to L-DOPA
treatment. These data provide the first evidence that STN-HFS exacerbates the
responsiveness of striatal cells to L-DOPA medication and suggest that STN-HFS
acts specifically through an L-DOPA-modulated signal transduction pathway
associated with LIDs in the striatum. They point to striatal cells as a primary
site for the complex interactions between these two therapeutic approaches in PD 
and argue against a direct anti-dyskinetic action of STN-HFS.

in steroidogenesis.

Transcription regulatory genes are crucial modulators of cell physiology and
metabolism whose intracellular levels are tightly controlled to respond to
extracellular stimuli. We studied transcription regulatory genes modulated by
angiotensin II, one of the most important regulators of adrenal cortical cell
function, and their role in adrenal steroidogenesis in H295R human adrenocortical
cells. Angiotensin II-modulated transcription regulatory genes were identified
with high-density oligonucleotide microarrays and the results validated by
real-time RT-PCR. Cotransfection reporter assays were performed in H295R cells to
analyze the role of these transcription regulatory genes in the control of the
expression of 11beta-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase, the last and unique
enzymes of the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid biosynthetic pathways,
respectively. We selected a subset of the most regulated genes for reporter
plasmid studies to determine the effect on these enzymes. BHLHB2, BTG2, and SALL1
decreased expression of both enzymes, whereas CITED2, EGR2, ELL2, FOS, FOSB,
HDAC5, MAFF, MITF, NFIL3, NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3, PER1, and VDR increased expression
for both enzymes. By the ratio of aldosterone synthase to 11beta-hydroxylase
expression, NFIL3, NR4A1, NR4A2, and NR4A3 show the greatest selectivity toward
upregulating expression of the mineralocorticoid biosynthetic pathway
preferentially. In summary, this study reports for the first time a set of
transcription regulatory genes that are modulated by angiotensin II and their
role in adrenal gland steroidogenesis. Abnormal regulation of the
mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid biosynthesis pathways is involved in several 
pathophysiological conditions; hence the modulated transcription regulatory genes
described may correlate with adrenal steroidogenesis pathologies.

Regulation of fosB and DeltafosB mRNA expression: in vivo and in vitro studies.

Alibhai IN(1), Green TA, Potashkin JA, Nestler EJ.

Author information:

Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390-9070, USA.

The transcription factor DeltaFosB, a truncated splice isoform of FosB,
accumulates in brain after several types of chronic stimulation. This
accumulation is thought to be mediated by the unique stability of DeltaFosB
compared to all other Fos family proteins. The goal of the present study was to
determine if the relative expression of the two fosB isoforms is also regulated
at the mRNA level, thereby further contributing to the selective accumulation of 
DeltaFosB after chronic stimulation. First, unlike the protein, the half-life of 
DeltafosB mRNA is only slightly longer than that of full-length fosB mRNA both in
cultured cells in vitro and in the brain in vivo. Additionally, similar to c-fos,
both fosB isoforms are induced abundantly in striatum after acute administration 
of amphetamine or stress, and partially desensitize after chronic exposures.
Surprisingly, the relative ratio of DeltafosB to fosB mRNA increases most
significantly after acute, not chronic, stimulation. Finally, overexpression of
polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB1), which regulates RNA splicing, in
cultured cells decreases the relative expression of DeltafosB compared to fosB
mRNA. Together, these findings suggest that splicing of fosB pre-mRNA is
regulated by the quantity of unspliced transcript available to the splicing
machinery. These data provide fundamental information concerning the generation
of DeltafosB mRNA, and indicate that the selective accumulation of DeltaFosB
protein with chronic stimulation does not involve its preferential generation by 
RNA splicing.

Regulation of DeltaFosB transcriptional activity by Ser27 phosphorylation.

Ulery PG(1), Nestler EJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Psychiatry, Center for Basic Neuroscience, The University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas Texas, USA.

The transcription factor, DeltaFosB, is an important mediator of the long-term
plasticity induced in brain by chronic exposure to drugs of abuse, stress, or
several other psychoactive stimuli. We have previously demonstrated that the
casein kinase 2 (CK2)-mediated phosphorylation of a highly conserved N-terminal
serine (Ser27) plays a critical role in regulating DeltaFosB's unusual stability,
while it does not affect that of the full-length FosB protein. In the present
study, we analysed whether CK2 and Ser27 phosphorylation also play a role in
regulating DeltaFosB's transcriptional activity. Our findings indicate that CK2
activation increases DeltaFosB's transactivation potential, while CK2 inhibition 
decreases it. Further, we show that preventing Ser27 phosphorylation by mutating 
the site to Ala results in a significant decrease in DeltaFosB transactivation,
without affecting DeltaFosB's subcellular localization or DNA-binding affinity.
In contrast, Ser27 does not seem to play a role in the transactivation potential 
of full-length FosB. These findings constitute the first evidence of a role for
phosphorylation in DeltaFosB's transcriptional activity.

The effects of antisense FosB and CREB intra-striatum injection on the expression
of prodynorphin (PDyn) gene in striatal neurons of Levodopa-induced dyskinesias
(LID) rats with Parkinson disease (PD) were explored. PD model in rats was
established by 6-OHDA microinjection stereotaxically. The rats were treated with 
chronic intermittent Levodopa celiac injection for 28 days to get the LID rats.
Antisense FosB and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were injected
into striatum of all rats respectively. In situ hybridization was used to measure
the changes in the expression of PDyn mRNA in striatum and behavior changes were 
observed. The results showed after administration of antisense FosB, abnormal
involuntary movement (AIM) was decreased and the expression of PDyn mRNA in
striatum was increased in LID rats as compared with sense FosB group (P<0.01,
respectively). As compared with the control group, the expression of PDyn mRNA in
striatum was decreased by antisense CREB-treated LID group (P<0.01) and compared 
with sense CREB treated LID group, antisense CREB-treated LID group showed no
changes in AIM scores and the expressions of PDyn mRNA (both P>0.05). In
conclusion, FosB protein, which replaced the CREG, could regulate the expression 
of PDyn mRNA and play critical role in the pathogenesis of LID.

Immunohistochemical Jun/Fos protein localization and DNA synthesis in rat adrenal
cortex after treatment with ACTH or FGF2.

Baccaro RB(1), Mendonça PO, Torres TE, Lotfi CF.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Anatomy, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of São
Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.

In vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that the expression of the early
response genes for Jun and Fos proteins plays an important role in adrenal cell
proliferation. In order to study the expression pattern of the activating
protein-1 (AP-1) family of oncogenes in the adrenal gland, we have used
immunohistochemistry to localize Jun and Fos protein expression in rat adrenal
cortex infused in situ with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), fibroblast growth
factor 2 (FGF2), or both. The expression of AP-1 factors has been found to be
correlated with in vivo ACTH and FGF2 proliferation in rats treated with
dexamethasone and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Induction of c-Jun and c-Fos in the
zona fasciculata and of FosB in the zona reticularis suggests that, after ACTH
stimulation, these proteins are the main AP-1 components in these zones. In vivo,
ACTH increases BrdU-positive cells in the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis
suggesting that the composition of AP-1 complexes in these zones is correlated
with proliferation. Patterns of Fos and Jun induction by FGF2 do not resemble
those after ACTH induction. However, in isolation, neither affects the zona
glomerulosa. In the zona fasciculata, and more so in the zona reticularis, FGF2
modulates responses to ACTH, reducing the numbers of Jun-positive cells,
Fos-positive cells, and DNA synthesis. This indicates that FGF2 antagonizes ACTH,
and that ACTH thus controls the trophic effect independently of exogenous FGF2.
Our results implicate the AP-1 family of transcription factors in the regulation 
of cell progression and the control of ACTH-induced proliferation in the zona
fasciculata and zona reticularis.

Amplification and overexpression of CACNA1E correlates with relapse in favorable

Schneider T, Vujanic GM, Pritchard-Jones K, Jones C.

Sutton, Surrey, United Kingdom.

PURPOSE: The most well established molecular markers of poor outcome in Wilms'
tumor are loss of heterozygosity at chromosomes 1p and/or 16q, although to date
no specific genes at these loci have been identified. We have previously shown a 
link between genomic gain of chromosome 1q and tumor relapse and sought to
further elucidate the role of genes on 1q in treatment failure.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization
identified a microamplification harboring a single gene (CACNA1E) at 1q25.3 in 6 
of 76 (7.9%) Wilms' tumors, correlating with a shorter relapse-free survival (P =
0.0044, log-rank test). Further characterization of this gene was carried out by 
measuring mRNA and protein expression as well as stable transfection of HEK293
cells.
RESULTS: Overexpression of the CACNA1E transcript was associated with DNA copy
number (P = 0.0204, ANOVA) and tumor relapse (P = 0.0851, log-rank test).
Immunohistochemistry against the protein product Ca(V)2.3 revealed expression
localized to the apical membrane in the distal tubules of normal kidney but not
to the metanephric blastemal cells of fetal kidney from which Wilms' tumors
arise. Nuclear localization in 99 of 160 (61.9%) Wilms' tumor cases correlated
with a reduced relapse-free survival, particularly in cases treated with
preoperative chemotherapy (P = 0.009, log-rank test). Expression profiling of
stably transfected HEK293 cells revealed specific up-regulation of the immediate 
early response genes EGR1/EGR2/EGR3 and FOS/FOSB, mediated by activation of the
MEK/ERK5/Nur77 pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: These data identify a unique genetic aberration with direct clinical
relevance in Wilms' tumor relapse and provide evidence for a potential novel
mechanism of treatment resistance in these tumors.

OBJECTIVE: To observe effects of electroacupuncture (EA) of low frequency on
heroin-seeking behavior and FosB protein expression in relative brain regions so 
as to explore the mechanism of EA.
METHODS: Rat model of relapsing into heroin was established with progressive
fixed ratio program, and model rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: a
"Sanyinjiao" needle-retention control group, a low frequency and weak EA group,
and a low frequency and strong EA group. Heroin-seeking behavior was elicited by 
conditional clue and small dose of heroin; FosB protein expression was
investigated with immunohistochemical technique.
RESULTS: After treatment, the heroin-seeking behavior induced by conditional clue
decreased in the needle-retention control group and the weak EA group, and the
heroin-seeking behavior induced by small dose of heroin in the weak EA group
significantly reduced as compared with the control group, and FosB protein
expression in the nucleus accumbens septi, globus pallidus, basolateral
amygdaloid nucleus significantly decreased in the weak EA group, and did not
significantly change in the strong EA group; the activity induced by heroin
increased as compared with those in the control group and the weak EA group.
CONCLUSION: EA of low frequency and low intensity can cure the heroin-seeking
behavior, which is correlated with regulating nervous adaptation of nucleus
accumbens septi, basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, etc..

Opposite regulation of cocaine-induced intracellular signaling and gene
expression by dopamine D1 and D3 receptors.

Zhang J(1), Xu M.

Chicago, IL 60637, USA. mxu@dacc.uchicago.edu

Repeated exposure to cocaine induces persistent neuroadaptations that involve
alterations in cellular signaling and gene expression mediated by dopamine (DA)
receptors in the brain. Both dopamine D1 and D3 receptors mediate cocaine-induced
behaviors and they are also coexpressed in the same neurons in the nucleus
accumbens (NAc) and caudoputamen (CPu). We have investigated whether these two
receptors coordinately regulate intracellular signaling and gene expression after
acute and repeated cocaine administration. We found that extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation and c-fos induction in the CPu following
an acute cocaine administration is mediated by the D1 receptor and inhibited by
the D3 receptor. ERK activation is necessary for acute cocaine-induced expression
of fos family genes that include c-fos, fosB, and fra2. Furthermore, potential
target genes of cAMP response element-binding (CREB) protein and/or AP-1
transcription complex, including dynorphin, neogenin, and synaptotagmin VII, are 
also oppositely regulated by D1 and D3 receptors after repeated cocaine
injections. Lastly, such regulation requires proper ERK activation. These results
suggest that D1 and D3 receptors oppositely regulate target gene expression by
regulating ERK activation after cocaine administration.

Tuberculosis (TB) of the CNS (CNS-TB) carries a high mortality. Disease pathology
is characterized by widespread destruction of CNS tissues. Matrix
metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is able to catabolyze specific components of the CNS 
tissue matrix and blood-brain barrier. Increased cerebrospinal fluid MMP-9
concentrations are associated with tissue damage, leukocyte infiltration, and
death in CNS-TB. Using zymography, Western analysis, and transcription factor
assays, we investigated mechanisms regulating MMP-9 activity in CNS-TB. We
demonstrate that conditioned media from monocytes infected with Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (CoMTB) induce MMP-9 secretion from astrocytes (U373-MG). IL-1beta
and TNF-alpha are necessary but not sufficient for such induction of astrocyte
MMP-9 secretion. CoMTB up-regulates AP-1 DNA-binding activity, and the c-Jun,
FosB, and JunB subunits are particularly increased. MMP-9 secretion from
CoMTB-stimulated astrocytes is dependent on the activity of p38, Erk, and Jnk
MAPKs. Phosphorylation of p38, Erk, and Jnk is activated rapidly, peaking 30 min 
poststimulation with CoMTB. Inhibition of IL-1beta but not TNF-alpha in CoMTB
decreases p38, Erk, and Jnk activity in astrocytes. Consistently, IL-1beta
signals through the MAPK cascade at physiological levels, whereas TNF-alpha,
IL-6, IL-10, CCL-2, CCL-5, and CXCL-8 (all present in CoMTB) do not. In summary, 
the data suggest that monocyte-dependent cytokine networks may play a key role in
the development of a matrix-degrading environment during CNS-TB.

In this study, we have used 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats to examine changes in
striatal junD and fosB/deltafosB expression induced by acute and chronic
treatment with L-DOPA (5 and 15 days). Changes at the protein levels were studied
using Western immunoblotting while mRNA changes were compared using in situ
hybridization histochemistry. We observed a significant increase in the level of 
deltaFosB proteins after chronic treatment with L-DOPA, an effect that was not
observed for JunD proteins. In addition, the upregulation of deltaFosB was
already present after an acute treatment but increased upon chronic treatment. By
contrast, junD and deltafosB mRNA were both upregulated significantly above
control levels after an acute injection of L-DOPA. In conclusion, this study
suggests a differential expression pattern of junD and deltafosB in a rat model
of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. The upregulation of deltaFosB protein, but not
JunD, is likely to reflect an increased stability of the deltaFosB proteins
without ongoing enhanced transcription of the encoding genes.

Differential effects of water deprivation and rehydration on Fos and
FosB/DeltaFosB staining in the rat brainstem.

This study examined the effects of dehydration and rehydration with water on Fos 
and FosB staining in the brainstem of rats. Male rats were water deprived for 48 
h (Dehyd, n=7) or 46 h followed by 2 h access to water (Rehyd, n=7). Controls had
ad libitum access to water (Con, n=9). Brainstems were stained for Fos and
FosB/DeltaFosB using commercially available antibodies. In the nucleus of the
solitary tract (NTS), the number of Fos stained neurons was significantly
increased by dehydration and increased further following rehydration (Con 5+/-1; 
Dehyd 22+/-1; Rehyd 48+/-5). The average number of Fos-positive cells in the
parabrachial nucleus (PBN) was significantly increased only by rehydration (Con
12+/-2; Dehyd 6+/-2; Rehyd 51+/-4). The area postrema (AP) showed significant
increases in Fos staining after dehydration and rehydration (Fos: Con 4+/-1;
Dehyd 28+/-3; Rehyd 24+/-3). In the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVL), Fos
staining significantly increased after dehydration and this effect was reduced by
rehydration (Con 3+/-1; Dehyd 21+/-2; Rehyd 12+/-1). In contrast, Fos staining in
the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVL) was not significantly influenced following
either dehydration or rehydration with water (Con 4+/-1; Dehyd 4+/-1; Rehyd
5+/-1). FosB/DeltaFosB staining in the NTS, AP, and RVL was comparably increased 
by dehydration and rehydration. In the PBN and CVL, FosB/DeltaFosB staining was
not affected by the treatments. Dehydration and rehydration have regionally
specific effects on Fos and FosB/DeltaFosB staining in the brainstem.

Identification of an histone H3 acetylated/K4-methylated-bound intragenic
enhancer regulatory for urokinase receptor expression.

The transcriptionally regulated urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor
(u-PAR) contributes to cancer progression. Although previous studies have
identified multiple 5' regulatory elements, these cis motifs cannot fully account
for u-PAR expression prompting a search for hitherto uncharacterized regulatory
elements. DNase I hypersensitivity and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using
u-PAR-expressing colon cancer cells indicated a hypersensitive region
(+665/+2068) in intron 1 enriched with acetylated histone 3 (H3) and H3
methylated at lysine 4, markers of regulatory regions. The +665/+2068 region
increased transcription from a u-PAR-promoter in an orientation- and
distance-independent manner fulfilling the criteria of an enhancer. Optimal
stimulation of the u-PAR promoter by phorbol ester required this enhancer.
Systematic truncations combined with DNase I footprinting revealed two protected 
regions (+1060/+1099 and +1123/+1134) with deletion of the latter practically
abolishing enhancer activity. The +1123/+1134 region harbored non-consensus
activator protein-1 and Ets1 binding sites bound with c-Jun (and/or the related
JunD/JunB) and c-Fos (and/or the related FosB/Fra-1/Fra-2) as revealed with
chromatin immunoprecipitation. Further, nuclear extract from resected colon
cancers showed elevated protein binding to a +1123/+1134-spanning probe
coordinate with elevated u-PAR protein. Thus, we have defined a novel intragenic 
enhancer in the u-PAR gene required for constitutive and inducible expression.

A splice variant of CD99 increases motility and MMP-9 expression of human breast 
cancer cells through the AKT-, ERK-, and JNK-dependent AP-1 activation signaling 
pathways.

The CD99 gene encodes two distinct transmembrane proteins by alternative splicing
of its transcript. To examine the effects of two CD99 isoforms on the invasive
phenotypes of breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cell 
lines were stably transfected with CD99 cDNAs encoding the major wild-type form
(type I) or a minor splice variant (type II). As a result, expression of CD99
type II, but not type I, markedly elevated the motility, binding to fibronectin, 
MMP-9 expression, and invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
In MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells expressing both CD99 type I and type II,
invasion-related cellular activities were inhibited by the transfection of small 
interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to CD99 type II. Meanwhile, CD99 type II-induced
MMP-9 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells was shown to be mediated by the binding of
AP-1 factors to the MMP-9 gene promoter. Gel shift assay revealed that ligation
of CD99 type II with antibody resulted in the binding of JunD to the AP-1 site of
the MMP-9 promoter region. Initiation of CD99 type II signaling by antibody
ligation increased expression of JunD and FosB AP-1 factors, along with
phosphorylation of Src, Akt, p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK. Knockdown of JunD and FosB
by siRNA transfection abolished the positive effects of CD99 type II on the
motility and MMP-9 expression of MDA-MB-231 cells. Increased expression of JunD
and FosB as well as elevated cell motility and MMP-9 expression by CD99 type II
ligation were also abrogated by inhibitors, dominant-negative forms, and siRNAs
for Akt1, ERK1/2, and JNK1 but not for p38 MAPK. These results suggest that
expression of a splice variant of CD99 contributes to the invasive ability of
human breast cancer cells by up-regulating AP-1-mediated gene expression through 
the Akt-dependent ERK and JNK signaling pathways.

Alterations in motivation have been implicated in the pathophysiology of several 
psychiatric disorders, including substance abuse and depression. Repeated
exposure to drugs of abuse or stress is known to persistently induce the
transcription factor deltaFosB in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsal
striatum, effects hypothesized to contribute to neuroadaptations in
dopamine-regulated signaling. Little is known, however, about the specific
involvement of deltaFosB in dysregulation of appetitively motivated behaviors. We
show here that inducible overexpression of deltaFosB in NAc and dorsal striatum
of bitransgenic mice, or specifically in the NAc core of rats by use of
viral-mediated gene transfer, enhanced food-reinforced instrumental performance
and progressive ratio responding. Very similar behavioral effects were found
after previous repeated exposure to cocaine, amphetamine, MDMA
[(+)-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine], or nicotine in rats. These results
reveal the powerful regulation of motivational processes by deltaFosB, and
provide evidence that drug-induced alterations in gene expression via induction
of deltaFosB within the NAc core may play a critical role in the impact of
motivational influences on instrumental behavior.

Methamphetamine-induced sensitization differentially alters pCREB and DeltaFosB
throughout the limbic circuit of the mammalian brain.

Enhancements in behavior that accompany repeated, intermittent administration of 
abused drugs (sensitization) endure long after drug administration has ceased.
Such persistence reflects changes in intracellular signaling cascades and
associated gene transcription factors in brain regions that are engaged by abused
drugs. This process is not characterized for the most potent psychomotor
stimulant, methamphetamine. Using motor behavior as an index of brain state in
rats, we verified that five once-daily injections of 2.5 mg/kg methamphetamine
induced behavioral sensitization that was demonstrated (expressed) 3 and 14 days 
later. Using immunoblot procedures, limbic brain regions implicated in behavioral
sensitization were assayed for extracellular signal-regulated kinase and its
phosphorylated form (pERK/ERK, a signal transduction kinase), cAMP response
element binding protein and its phosphorylated form (pCREB/CREB, a constitutively
expressed transcriptional regulator), and DeltaFosB (a long-lasting transcription
factor). pERK, ERK, and CREB levels were not changed for any region assayed. In
the ventral tegmental area, pCREB and DeltaFosB also were not changed. pCREB
(activated CREB) was elevated in the frontal cortex at 3 days withdrawal, but not
at 14 days. pCREB levels were decreased at 14 days withdrawal in the nucleus
accumbens and ventral pallidum. Accumbal and pallidal levels of DeltaFosB were
increased at 3 days withdrawal, and this increase persisted to 14 days in the
pallidum. Thus, only the ventral pallidum showed changes in molecular processes
that consistently correlated with motor sensitization, revealing that this region
may be associated with this enduring behavioral phenotype initiated by
methamphetamine. The present findings expand our understanding of the
neuroanatomical and molecular substrates that may play a role in the persistence 
of druginduced sensitization.

Alterations in gene expression in T1 alpha null lung: a model of deficient
alveolar sac development.

(1)Pulmonary Center, Department of Medicine, Boston University School of
Medicine, Boston, MA, USA. gmillien@bu.edu

BACKGROUND: Development of lung alveolar sacs of normal structure and size at
late gestation is necessary for the gas exchange process that sustains
respiration at birth. Mice lacking the lung differentiation gene T1alpha
[T1alpha(-/-)] fail to form expanded alveolar sacs, resulting in respiratory
failure at birth. Since little is known about the molecular pathways driving
alveolar sacculation, we used expression microarrays to identify genes altered in
the abnormal lungs and, by inference, may play roles in normal lung
morphogenesis.
RESULTS: Altered expression of genes related to cell-cell interaction, such as
ephrinA3, are observed in T1alpha(-/-) at E18.5. At term, FosB, Egr1, MPK-1 and
Nur77, which can function as negative regulators of the cell-cycle, are
down-regulated. This is consistent with the hyperproliferation of peripheral lung
cells in term T1alpha (-/-) lungs reported earlier. Biochemical assays show that 
neither PCNA nor p21 are altered at E18.5. At term in contrast, PCNA is
increased, and p21 is decreased.
CONCLUSION: This global analysis has identified a number of candidate genes that 
are significantly altered in lungs in which sacculation is abnormal. Many genes
identified were not previously associated with lung development and may
participate in formation of alveolar sacs prenatally.

The transcription factor DeltaFosB is recruited by inflammatory pain.

DeltaFosB, a stable splice variant of FosB, has been proposed to mediate
persistent brain adaptation in response to several chronic perturbations, but it 
has not yet been considered in the context of sustained pain. Inflammatory pain
induces neuronal plasticity that can result in persistent alteration of
nociceptive pathways. This neuronal plasticity can partly result from changes in 
gene expression controlled by transcription factors. In the present study, we
analyse the capacity of carrageenan-mediated inflammation to induce DeltaFosB in 
the spinal cord. We found that hind-paw inflammation increases FosB-like
immunoreactivity in the superficial layers of rat lumbar spinal cord for at least
7 days. This induction parallels mechanical hyperalgesia and is maximal in the
dorsal horn of segment L4 of the spinal cord which corresponds to the primary
nociceptive afferent regions from the hind paw. We identified this FosB-like
signal as DeltaFosB by comparing data obtained with antibodies raised against
either an epitope present in both FosB and DeltaFosB, or the FosB C-terminal
region that is deleted in DeltaFosB. The week-lasting changes in DeltaFosB
highlight the interest in this protein as a molecular marker of sustained pain,
and suggest a role of this transcription factor in pain-related plasticity within
the spinal cord.

Cardiac myocytes, upon exposure to increasing doses of norepinephrine (NE),
transit from hypertrophic to apoptotic phenotype. Since reactive oxygen species
(ROS) generation is attributed to both phenomena, the authors tested whether an
elevation in intracellular ROS level causes such transition. H9c2 cardiac
myoblasts upon treatment with hypertrophic and apoptotic doses of NE (2 and 100
microM, respectively) transiently induced intracellular ROS at a comparable
level, while 200 microM H(2)O(2), another proapoptotic agonist, showed robust and
sustained ROS generation. Upon analysis of a number of redox-responsive
transcription factors as the downstream targets of ROS signaling, the authors
observed that NE (2 and 100 microM) and H(2)O(2) (200 microM) were ineffective in
inducing NF-kappaB while both the agonists upregulated AP-1 and Nrf-2. However,
the extents of induction of AP-1 and Nrf-2 were not in direct correlation with
the respective ROS levels. Also, AP-1 activities induced by two doses of NE were 
intrinsically different, since at 2 microM, it primarily induced FosB, and at 100
microM it activated Fra-1. Differential induction of FosB and Fra-1 was also
reiterated in adult rat myocardium injected with increasing doses of NE.
Therefore, NE induces hypertrophy and apoptosis in cardiac myocytes by distinct
redox-signaling rather than a general surge of ROS.

Semirational design of Jun-Fos coiled coils with increased affinity: Universal
implications for leucine zipper prediction and design.

Activator protein-1 (AP-1) is a crucial transcription factor implicated in
numerous cancers. For this reason, nine homologues of the AP-1 leucine zipper
region have been characterized: Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra1, and Fra2), Jun (c-Jun,
JunB, and JunD), and semirational library-designed winning peptides FosW and
JunW. The latter two were designed to specifically target c-Fos or c-Jun. They
have been identified by using protein-fragment complementation assays combined
with growth competition. This assay removes nonspecific, unstable, and protease
susceptible library members from the pool, leaving winners with excellent drug
potential. Thermal melts of all 45 possible dimeric interactions have been
surveyed, with the FosW-c-Jun complex displaying a melting temperature (T(m)) of 
63 degrees C, compared to only 16 degrees C for wild-type c-Fos-c-Jun
interaction. This impressive 70,000-fold K(D) decrease is largely due to
optimized core packing, alpha-helical propensity, and electrostatics.
Contrastingly, due to a poor c-Fos core, c-Fos-JunW dimerizes with lower
affinity. However the T(m) far exceeds wild-type c-Fos-c-Jun and averaged JunW
and c-Fos, indicating a preference over either homodimer. Finally, and with wider
implications, we have compiled a method for predicting interaction of parallel,
dimeric coiled coils, using our T(m) data as a training set, and applying it to
59 bZIP proteins previously reported. Our algorithm, unlike others to date,
accounts for helix propensity, which is found to be integral in coiled coil
stability. Indeed, in applying the algorithm to these 59(2) bZIP interactions, we
were able to correctly identify 92% of all strong interactions and 92% of all
noninteracting pairs.

Although neurological symptoms in individuals exposed to toluene both inside and 
outside the homes have been reported well, the chronic effects of low-level
toluene-exposure on the hippocampal expression of neuronal synaptic plasticity
related genes have not been studied in vivo. In the present study, to understand 
the possible adult hippocampal neurobiological responses of mice chronic exposure
to toluene at a low-level human occupational-exposure, we exposed 10-week-old
C3H/HeN female mice to 50 ppm toluene or filtered air for 6 h a day, on
5-consecutive days of a week for 6 and 12 weeks, in a whole-body exposure
chamber. Then, by a quantitative real-time PCR method, we investigated the
hippocampal mRNA-expression of several genes, functions of which are necessary to
maintain the homeostasis of neuronal synaptic plasticity. We observed that
chronic exposure of mice to 50 ppm toluene for a longer period (12 weeks) caused 
a significant up-regulation of NMDA receptor subunit 2B (NMDA NR2B) expression
associated with a simultaneous induction of CaMKIV, CREB-1, and FosB/DeltaFosB in
the same hippocampal tissues. Our data indicate that the in vivo transcriptional 
up-regulation of these genes in the adult hippocampus of our experimental mouse
model following the chronic exposure to toluene may be an NMDA-receptor related
neuroprotective mechanism of gene expression.

Habituation to the test cage influences amphetamine-induced locomotion and Fos
expression and increases FosB/DeltaFosB-like immunoreactivity in mice.

Pre-exposure to the testing cage (habituation or familiarization) is a common
procedure aimed at reducing the interference of novelty-induced arousal and
drug-independent individual differences on neural and behavioral measures.
However, recent results suggest that this procedure might exert a major influence
on the effects of addictive drugs. The present experiments tested the effects of 
repeated exposure to a test cage (1 h daily for four consecutive days) on
amphetamine-induced locomotion and Fos expression as well as on
FosB/DeltaFosB-like immunoreactivity in mice of the C57BL/6J and DBA/2J inbred
strains that differ for the response to amphetamine, stress and novelty. Daily
experiences with the test cage increased FosB/DeltaFosB-like immunoreactivity in 
the medial-prefrontal cortex of both strains of mice and in the caudate of mice
of the C57 strain, as reported for repeated stress in the rat. Moreover, previous
habituation to the test cage reduced the locomotor response to a low dose of
amphetamine only in DBA mice while it reduced amphetamine-induced Fos expression 
in medial-prefrontal cortex, dorsal caudate and the accumbens shell of mice of
the C57 strain. These results demonstrate indexes of stress-like plasticity in
the brains of mice exposed to a procedure of familiarization to the testing
environment. Moreover, they suggest that the procedure of daily familiarization
influences the pattern of brain Fos expression induced by amphetamine. Finally,
they indicate complex interactions between experience with the testing
environment, genotype and drug.

Cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury induces matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression

Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) is a central component of the response to
injury in the heart. During ischemia, MMP-2 influences ventricular performance
and is a determinant of postinfarction remodeling. Elevation of MMP-2 during
reperfusion after ischemia suggests that new protein is synthesized, but the
molecular regulation of MMP-2 generation during ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury
has not been studied. Using the MMP-2 promoter linked to a beta-galactosidase
reporter in transgenic mice, we investigated the transcriptional regulation and
cellular sources of MMP-2 in isolated, perfused mouse hearts subjected to acute
global I/R injury. I/R injury induced a rapid activation of MMP-2 promoter
activity with the appearance of beta-galactosidase antigen in cardiomyocytes,
fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Activation of intrinsic MMP-2 transcription
and translation was confirmed by real-time PCR and quantitative Western blot
analyses. MMP-2 transcription and translation were inhibited by perfusion with
1.0 mM hydroxyl radical scavenger N-(-2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine. Nuclear
extracts demonstrated increased abundance of two activator proteins-1 (AP-1)
components JunB and FosB following I/R injury. Immunohistochemical staining
localized JunB and FosB proteins to the nuclei of all three cardiac cell types
following I/R injury, consistent with enhanced nuclear transport of these
transcription factors. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of the AP-1 binding
site in the intrinsic murine MMP-2 promoter yielded only JunB under control
conditions, whereas ChIP following I/R injury recovered both JunB and FosB,
consistent with a change in occupancy from JunB homodimers in controls to
JunB/FosB heterodimers following I/R injury. We conclude that enhanced MMP-2
transcription and translation following I/R injury are mediated by induction, via
oxidant stress, of discrete AP-1 transcription factor components.

Regulation of DeltaFosB stability by phosphorylation.

Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390-9070, USA.

The transcription factor DeltaFosB (also referred to as FosB2 or FosB[short
form]) is an important mediator of the long-term plasticity induced in brain by
chronic exposure to several types of psychoactive stimuli, including drugs of
abuse, stress, and electroconvulsive seizures. A distinct feature of DeltaFosB is
that, once induced, it persists in brain for relatively long periods of time in
the absence of further stimulation. The mechanisms underlying this apparent
stability, however, have remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that DeltaFosB is
a relatively stable transcription factor, with a half-life of approximately 10 h 
in cell culture. Furthermore, we show that DeltaFosB is a phosphoprotein in brain
and that phosphorylation of a highly conserved serine residue (Ser27) in
DeltaFosB protects it from proteasomal degradation. We provide several lines of
evidence suggesting that this phosphorylation is mediated by casein kinase 2.
These findings constitute the first evidence that DeltaFosB is phosphorylated and
demonstrate that phosphorylation contributes to its stability, which is at the
core of its ability to mediate long-lasting adaptations in brain.

Apart from activation of the brain reward system, cocaine administration
influences the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by
affecting CRH neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN).
In order to find a molecular mechanism of cocaine-evoked effects in the PVN, in
the present study, we investigated the impact of cocaine on the expression of
FosB/DeltaFosB transcription factors in the PVN. Using an immunohistochemical
method, we found that acute cocaine treatment (25 mg/kg) induced a relatively
long-lasting (at least 72 h) expression of FosB/DeltaFosB in the PVN, whereas
repeated cocaine administration (25 mg/kg, once daily for 5 consecutive days)
caused accumulation of FosB/DeltaFosB in the PVN. The latter observation was
further confirmed by the Western blot technique which revealed that repeated
exposure to cocaine specifically increased the expression of a stable isoform of 
DeltaFosB (35 kDa). Using a double-labeling immunofluorescent method, it was
established that FosB/DeltaFosB proteins induced by repeated cocaine treatment
were present in a small population of CRF-immunoreactive neurons of the PVN.
Furthermore, it was found that pretreatment with the specific antagonist of
dopamine D1-like receptors SCH 23390 (1 mg/kg) attenuated the expression and
accumulation of FosB/DeltaFosB in the PVN, evoked by repeated cocaine
administration. Although functional consequences of the above effects for the
process of addiction remain to be established, the obtained results indicate that
cocaine administration can produce relatively long-lasting changes in the
expression of FosB/DeltaFosB transcription factors in PVN neurons (in some
populations of CRF-immunoreactive neurons, among others) and that dopamine
D1-like receptors are involved in the above effects. Finally, it is proposed that
the long-lasting expression as well as the accumulation of DeltaFosB in the PVN
may constitute a molecular basis underlying adaptive changes occurring in the HPA
axis after relatively high doses of cocaine.

Differential regulation of c-Fos and FosB in the rat brain after amygdala
kindling.

Members of the inducible transcription factor Fos family, that are part of the
AP-1 complex that binds to the corresponding promoter site, are implicated in the
regulation of gene transcription after acute and chronic seizures. However,
little is known about the temporal expression of the AP-1 transcription factors
and if individual proteins composing this complex have distinct roles in
development and maintenance of permanent epilepsy. In this study, the AP-1
binding capacity, its content of different Fos proteins, and the anatomical
specificity, were analyzed 2 or 18 h after achieving full kindling in rats. The
same analysis was performed in fully kindled animal receiving a new stimulus
after a 3-week pause to determine the extent of stability of the AP-1
transcription factors. While both c-Fos and FosB were induced in all cortical
areas after a single stimulus, only FosB-immunoreactivity remained after 18 h. A 
single stimulation to kindled animals left undisturbed for 3 weeks induced a
long-lasting upregulation of AP-1 binding in the frontal cortex, but not in the
hippocampus suggesting a permanent exposure of AP-1 heterocomplexes in the
frontal cortex. Supershift assays showed that FosB is the dominant component of
the long-term AP-1 complex. It is concluded that the AP-1 binding complex in
fully kindled rats is composed of different proteins, and that FosB-containing
AP-1 complexes mediate long-term effects in the frontal cortex.

Effects of chronic nicotine administration and its withdrawal on striatal
FosB/DeltaFosB and c-Fos expression in rats and mice.

Helsinki, P.O. Box 56 (Viikinkaari 5), Helsinki FIN-00014, Finland.

DeltaFosB, a member of Fos family of transcription factors, is implicated in
behavioural responses and synaptic plasticity induced by abused drugs. We studied
the expressions of FosB/DeltaFosB and c-Fos immunohistochemically in two
dopaminergic brain areas, nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and caudate-putamen (CPu). In 
mice neither 2- nor 7-week oral nicotine treatment induced expression of
long-lived DeltaFosB isoforms although during the treatment in the NAcc
FosB/DeltaFosB expression was increased as was c-Fos in the CPu. In rats given
nicotine subcutaneously once daily for 5days FosB/DeltaFosB expression was
elevated in the NAcc still after 24-h withdrawal suggesting accumulation of
DeltaFosB but in the CPu neither FosB/DeltaFosB nor c-Fos expression was altered.
Thus, in rats repeated nicotine administration seems mainly affect the NAcc
paralleling with the evidence that nicotine stimulates preferentially mesolimbic 
dopamine system. Also, repeated nicotine induced behavioural sensitization in
rats agreeing with suggested role of DeltaFosB in the development of psychomotor 
sensitization. However, in mice given nicotine via drinking fluid although
striatal fosB and c-fos were activated by nicotine even after 7-week treatment no
evidence of accumulation of long-lived DeltaFosB was found suggesting perhaps a
species difference or more likely a role for the manner of administration.

Identification of Bacillus subtilis sigma-dependent genes that provide intrinsic 
resistance to antimicrobial compounds produced by Bacilli.

Butcher BG(1), Helmann JD.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853-8101, USA.

Bacillus subtilis produces many antibiotics of varying structures and
specificity. Here we identify a prominent role for sigma(W), an extracytoplasmic 
function (ECF) sigma factor, in providing intrinsic resistance to antimicrobial
compounds produced by other Bacilli. By using a panel of B. subtilis mutants
disrupted for each of the 30 known sigma(W)-dependent operons we identified
resistance genes for at least three different antimicrobial compounds. The ydbST 
and fosB genes contribute to resistance to antimicrobial compound(s) produced by 
B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42, the yqeZyqfAB operon provides resistance to the
SPbeta prophage-encoded bacteriocin sublancin, and the yknWXYZ operon and yfhL
provide resistance to the antimicrobial peptide SdpC. YfhL encodes a paralogue of
SdpI, a membrane protein that provides immunity to SdpC. In competition
experiments, we identify sigma(W) as a key factor in allowing B. subtilis to
resist antibiotic killing and encroachment by competing strains. Together with
the previous observation that sigma(W) provides inducible resistance against the 
Streptomyces antibiotic fosfomycin, these studies support the notion that
sigma(W) controls an antibiosis regulon important in the microbial ecology of
soil bacteria.

Chronic stress induces neurobiological alterations which have consequences for
subsequent stress handling. In the current experiment, ovariectomized rats were
subjected daily to a stressor for 21 days. Thereafter, the rats were treated for 
21 days with 17beta-estradiol benzoate (10 microg/250 g, once every 4 days) or
mirtazapine (10 mg/kg, daily). In this way, we were able to evaluate the ability 
of these compounds to reverse chronic stress-induced changes in the activity of
the limbic system. After 21 days of recovery and treatment, the rats were
re-exposed to the adverse environment of the initial stressor and perfused 2 h
later. Ovariectomized rats displayed increased numbers of c-Fos-positive nuclei, 
after re-exposure to the stressor, in the paraventricular nucleus of the
hypothalamus, dentate gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex and central and medial
amygdala. Cyclic estradiol treatment attenuated the sensitization of the
paraventricular nucleus and central amygdala. Mirtazapine increased the number of
c-Fos-positive nuclei in the central amygdala and dentate gyrus. Long-term
transcriptional changes induced by chronic stress were determined with DeltaFosB 
immunoreactivity. The medial prefrontal cortex showed an increased number of
DeltaFosB-positive nuclei after chronic stress and this was not affected by
estradiol or mirtazapine administration during recovery. In conclusion, cyclic
estradiol administration reversed chronic stress-induced sensitization in the
limbic system, the paraventricular nucleus and central amygdala of female rats,
output regions of the limbic system involved in fear responses. Mirtazapine did
not achieve this reversal of stress-induced aberrations in the limbic system
after 21 days of treatment.

Tissue culture methods can strongly induce immediate early gene expression in
retinal pigment epithelial cells.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Ophthalmology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center,
Memphis, Tennessee 38163, USA.

Expression and activation of AP-1 transcription factor proteins is stimulated by 
diverse physiological factors including cytokines, growth factors, and various
cell stressors. The studies presented here arose out of observations in our
laboratory that there was rapid and significant induction of immediate early gene
(IEG) transcription in "control" retinal pigment epithelial cell (RPE) cultures
following media changes. To clarify whether routine in vitro manipulations have
the potential to induce the expression of transcription factors and
non-transcription factor genes, we performed quantitative PCR studies on RPE
cells in culture following various cell rinse conditions. Our studies showed that
there is rapid and dramatic induction of FosB, JunB, and EGR-1 transcription
within 1 h following media aspiration and rinsing of confluent cells in vitro.
The induction of these genes ranged from 32- to 256-fold following a buffered
saline or media rinse. Modifying the rinse conditions and media used can
eliminate this early response; however, a significant effect is still seen for
FosB and JunB, 4 h after rinsing. The response was not seen with
non-transcription factor genes and can be eliminated for most of the genes using 
a non-rinsing method. These studies demonstrate that rinsing cells in culture has
the potential to profoundly affect subsequent analyses of gene expression and
must be carefully controlled.

Hemin-mediated regulation of an antioxidant-responsive element of the human
ferritin H gene and role of Ref-1 during erythroid differentiation of K562 cells.

University, Campus Box 7633, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695, USA.

An effective utilization of intracellular iron is a prerequisite for erythroid
differentiation and hemoglobinization. Ferritin, consisting of 24 subunits of H
and L, plays a crucial role in iron homeostasis. Here, we have found that the H
subunit of the ferritin gene is activated at the transcriptional level during
hemin-induced differentiation of K562 human erythroleukemic cells. Transfection
of various 5' regions of the human ferritin H gene fused to a luciferase reporter
into K562 cells demonstrated that hemin activates ferritin H transcription
through an antioxidant-responsive element (ARE) that is responsible for induction
of a battery of phase II detoxification genes by oxidative stress. Gel
retardation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that hemin
induced binding of cJun, JunD, FosB, and Nrf2 b-zip transcription factors to AP1 
motifs of the ferritin H ARE, despite no significant change in expression levels 
or nuclear localization of these transcription factors. A Gal4-luciferase
reporter assay did not show activation of these b-zip transcription factors after
hemin treatment; however, redox factor 1 (Ref-1), which increases DNA binding of 
Jun/Fos family members via reduction of a conserved cysteine in their DNA binding
domains, showed induced nuclear translocation after hemin treatment in K562
cells. Consistently, Ref-1 enhanced Nrf2 binding to the ARE and ferritin H
transcription. Hemin also activated ARE sequences of other phase II genes, such
as GSTpi and NQO1. Collectively, these results suggest that hemin activates the
transcription of the ferritin H gene during K562 erythroid differentiation by
Ref-1-mediated activation of these b-zip transcription factors to the ARE.

Cocaine-induced dendritic spine formation in D1 and D2 dopamine
receptor-containing medium spiny neurons in nucleus accumbens.

Psychostimulant-induced alteration of dendritic spines on dopaminoceptive neurons
in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) has been hypothesized as an adaptive neuronal
response that is linked to long-lasting addictive behaviors. NAcc is largely
composed of two distinct subpopulations of medium-sized spiny neurons expressing 
high levels of either dopamine D1 or D2 receptors. In the present study, we
analyzed dendritic spine density after chronic cocaine treatment in distinct D1
or D2 receptor-containing medium-sized spiny neurons in NAcc. These studies made 
use of transgenic mice that expressed EGFP under the control of either the D1 or 
D2 receptor promoter (Drd1-EGFP or Drd2-EGFP). After 28 days of cocaine treatment
and 2 days of withdrawal, spine density increased in both Drd1-EGFP- and
Drd2-EGFP-positive neurons. However, the increase in spine density was maintained
only in Drd1-EGFP-positive neurons 30 days after drug withdrawal. Notably,
increased DeltaFosB expression also was observed in Drd1-EGFP- and
Drd2-EGFP-positive neurons after 2 days of drug withdrawal but only in
Drd1-EGFP-positive neurons after 30 days of drug withdrawal. These results
suggest that the increased spine density observed after chronic cocaine treatment
is stable only in D1-receptor-containing neurons and that DeltaFosB expression is
associated with the formation and/or the maintenance of dendritic spines in D1 as
well as D2 receptor-containing neurons in NAcc.

to acute morphine is altered.

Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) regulates striatal
dopaminergic neurons. To study whether reduced endogenous GDNF affect morphine's 
effects on striatal dopamine transmission, we estimated extracellular
concentrations of dopamine and its metabolites by microdialysis in vivo and
tissue concentrations post mortem in mice lacking one GDNF allele (GDNF+/- mice).
In the wild-type mice, acute morphine (5 and 10 mg/kg s.c.) increased accumbal
dopamine output dose-dependently (maximally by 30 and 80%, respectively). In the 
GDNF+/- mice, 5 mg/kg of morphine enhanced the accumbal dopamine output maximally
by 110%, and significantly more than morphine 10 mg/kg (maximally by 60%). Also, 
the response of extracellular accumbal DOPAC to acute morphine was significantly 
altered in the GDNF+/- mice. In mice of both genotypes, the responses to morphine
in the caudate putamen were similar to but much less intense than those in the
nucleus accumbens. Morphine at the doses 5, 10, and 30 mg/kg dose-dependently
elevated the striatal tissue concentrations of DOPAC and HVA, but the effect of
30 mg/kg was significantly smaller in the GDNF+/- mice than in their wild-type
littermates. The binding of [(3)H]DAMGO to striatal membrane homogenates was
similar between the genotypes. However, morphine induced antinociception in the
GDNF+/- mice at a smaller dose than in the controls. The finding that reduced
GDNF level alters the effects of morphine on striatal dopamine and our previous
findings of elevated extracellular striatal dopamine concentrations and
FosB/DeltaFosB expression in the GDNF+/- mice show the importance of GDNF in the 
regulation of striatal dopaminergic system.

The transcription factor DeltaFosB is induced in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and 
dorsal striatum by the repeated administration of drugs of abuse. Here, we
investigated the role of DeltaFosB in the NAc in behavioral responses to opiates.
We achieved overexpression of DeltaFosB by using a bitransgenic mouse line that
inducibly expresses the protein in the NAc and dorsal striatum and by using
viral-mediated gene transfer to specifically express the protein in the NAc.
DeltaFosB overexpression in the NAc increased the sensitivity of the mice to the 
rewarding effects of morphine and led to exacerbated physical dependence, but
also reduced their sensitivity to the analgesic effects of morphine and led to
faster development of analgesic tolerance. The opioid peptide dynorphin seemed to
be one target through which DeltaFosB produced this behavioral phenotype.
Together, these experiments demonstrated that DeltaFosB in the NAc, partly
through the repression of dynorphin expression, mediates several major features
of opiate addiction.

Reg IV activates the epidermal growth factor receptor/Akt/AP-1 signaling pathway 
in colon adenocarcinomas.

Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Reg IV, a secreted protein and member of the Reg multigene
family, is up-regulated in malignancies of the human gastrointestinal tract,
including colorectal carcinoma (CRC). However, in vitro signal transduction
pathway(s) utilized by Reg IV are not yet known.
METHODS: To determine the signaling pathway(s) responsive to Reg IV, we examined 
the effects of purified recombinant human Reg IV (rhR4) on HCT116 and HT29 colon 
adenocarcinoma cells.
RESULTS: Addition of rhR4 to cultures led to a dose-dependent increase in cell
number similar to that observed after treatment with epidermal growth factor
(EGF). In addition, rhR4 treatment resulted in rapid phosphorylation of EGF
receptor at Tyr992 and Tyr1068 and Akt at Thr308 and Ser473. Using luciferase
reporter gene assays, we demonstrated that Reg IV signaling through EGF receptor 
and Akt results in increased activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor
activity. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western
blot analyses revealed quantitative increases in c-Jun, JunB, JunD, and FosB
expression associated with increased AP-1 activity. Electrophoretic mobility
shift assay further revealed significant increases in AP-1 binding activity in
rhR4-treated cells, with increased supershift in the presence of antibodies to
JunB, JunD, and FosB. Furthermore, rhR4 treatments led to the increased
expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, survivin, and matrilysin, genes associated with a
poor prognosis in advanced CRC.
CONCLUSIONS: Reg IV is a potent activator of the EGF receptor/Akt/AP-1 signaling 
pathway in CRC. Disruption of Reg signaling may have utility as a therapeutic
intervention for human gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas.

Pertussis toxin B-oligomer suppresses IL-6 induced HIV-1 and chemokine expression
in chronically infected U1 cells via inhibition of activator protein 1.

Pertussis toxin B-oligomer (PTX-B) inhibits HIV replication in T lymphocytes and 
monocyte-derived macrophages by interfering with multiple steps of the HIV life
cycle. PTX-B prevents CCR5-dependent (R5) virus entry in a noncompetitive manner,
and it also exerts suppressive effects on both R5- and CXCR4-dependent HIV
expression at a less-characterized postentry level. We demonstrate in this study 
that PTX-B profoundly inhibits HIV expression in chronically infected
promonocytic U1 cells stimulated with several cytokines and, particularly, the
IL-6-mediated effect, a cytokine that triggers viral production in these cells
independently of NF-kappaB activation. From U1 cells we have subcloned a cell
line, named U1-CR1, with increased responsiveness to IL-6. In these cells, PTX-B 
neither down-regulated the IL-6R nor prevented IL-6 induced signaling in terms of
STAT3 phosphorylation and DNA binding. In contrast, PTX-B inhibited AP-1 binding 
to target DNA and modified its composition with a proportional increases in FosB,
Fra2, and ATF2. PTX-B inhibited IL-6-induced HIV-1 long-terminal repeat-driven
transcription from A, C, E, and F viral subtypes, which contain functional AP-1
binding sites, but failed to inhibit transcription from subtypes B and D LTR
devoid of these sites. In addition, PTX-B inhibited the secretion of
IL-6-induced, AP-1-dependent genes, including urokinase-type plasminogen
activator, CXCL8/IL-8, and CCL2/monocyte chemotactic protein-1. Thus, PTX-B
suppression of IL-6 induced expression of HIV and cellular genes in chronically
infected promonocytic cells is strongly correlated to inhibition of AP-1.

We employed in vitro and ex vivo imaging tools to characterize the function of
limbic neuron networks in pilocarpine-treated and age-matched, nonepileptic
control (NEC) rats. Pilocarpine-treated animals represent an established model of
mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Intrinsic optical signal (IOS) analysis of
hippocampal-entorhinal cortex (EC) slices obtained from epileptic rats 3 wk after
pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) revealed hyperexcitability in many
limbic areas, but not in CA3 and medial EC layer III. By visualizing
immunopositivity for FosB/DeltaFosB-related proteins which accumulate in the
nuclei of neurons activated by seizures we found that: (1) 24 h after SE,
FosB/DeltaFosB immunoreactivity was absent in medial EC layer III, but abundant
in dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper (including CA3) and subiculum; (2)
FosB/DeltaFosB levels progressively diminished 3 and 7 d after SE, whereas
remaining elevated (p < 0.01) in subiculum; (3) FosB/DeltaFosB levels sharply
increased 2 wk after SE (and remained elevated up to 3 wk) in dentate gyrus and
in most of the other areas but not in CA3. A conspicuous neuronal damage was
noticed in medial EC layer III, whereas hippocampus was more preserved. IOS
analysis of the stimulus-induced responses in slices 3 wk after SE demonstrated
that IOSs in CA3 were lower (p < 0.05) than in NEC slices following dentate gyrus
stimulation, but not when stimuli were delivered in CA3. These findings indicate 
that CA3 networks are hypoactive in comparison with other epileptic limbic areas.
We propose that this feature may affect the ability of hippocampal outputs to
control epileptiform synchronization in EC.

Remodeling chromatin is essential for cAMP-regulated gene expression, necessary
not only for development but also for memory storage and other enduring mental
states. Histone acetylation and deacetylation mediate long-lasting forms of
synaptic plasticity in Aplysia as well as cognition in mice. Here, we show that
histone acetylation by the cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-binding
protein (CBP) mediates sensitivity to cocaine by regulating expression of the
fosB gene and its splice variant, DeltafosB, a transcription factor previously
implicated in addiction. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay with
antibodies against histone H4 or CBP, we find that CBP is recruited to the fosB
promoter to acetylate histone H4 in response to acute exposure to cocaine. We
show that mutant mice that lack one allele of the CBP gene and have normal levels
of fosB expression are less sensitive to chronic (10-day) administration of
cocaine than are wild-type mice. This decreased sensitivity is correlated with
decreased histone acetylation and results in decreased fosB expression and
diminished accumulation of DeltafosB. Thus, CBP, which forms part of the promoter
complex with CREB, mediates sensitivity to cocaine by acetylating histones.

c-Fos and deltaFosB expression are differentially altered in distinct subregions 
of the nucleus accumbens shell in cocaine-sensitized rats.

Repeated cocaine administration in rats can lead to sensitization as evidenced by
an increased locomotor response to a subsequent exposure (challenge) dose of
cocaine even after a drug-free period. Expression of the immediate early gene
product, c-Fos, differs among distinct subregions of the nucleus accumbens shell.
This would suggest that these subregions may be differentially involved in
sensitization. The present study quantified c-Fos- and deltaFosB-immunoreactive
nuclei in subterritories of the nucleus accumbens in animals behaviorally
sensitized to cocaine. Rats received a sensitization-inducing regimen of cocaine 
(twice-daily injections of 15 mg/kg i.p. for five consecutive days). Fourteen
days following the last injection, rats were given a challenge injection of
cocaine (15 mg/kg i.p.), and killed 2 h later. Sections through the nucleus
accumbens were processed for tyrosine hydroxylase and either c-Fos or deltaFosB. 
The number of immunoreactive nuclei was quantified in five subregions of the
nucleus accumbens shell: the vertex, arch, cone, intermediate zone and
ventrolateral zone, which can be identified by differential histological staining
for tyrosine hydroxylase. Repeated cocaine administration resulted in robust
sensitization that was associated with more deltaFosB in the vertex, arch, and
cone compared with saline-treated controls. As previously reported, c-Fos
immunoreactivity was increased in the intermediate zone in cocaine-sensitized
rats. deltaFosB was significantly elevated in rats that did not receive a cocaine
challenge, attesting to the long half-life of this transcription factor. These
results provide further evidence suggesting distinct anatomical neuroadaptations 
within the nucleus accumbens shell that may play a functional role in
psychomotor-stimulant sensitization.

dopamine in learning and motivation for a food reward, we used dopamine
transporter knockdown mice (DAT KD) that have chronically elevated levels of
extracellular dopamine. The present study demonstrates that chronically elevated 
dopamine enhances tendency to work for a food reward without apparent effects on 
Pavlovian and operant learning for this reward. The increase in dopamine is
associated with elevated levels of dynorphin and Fos B expression in the dorsal
caudate-putamen and the core but not the shell subregion of the nucleus
accumbens. These data suggest that motivation to work, but not learning, for a
food reward appears to be under the critical influence of tonic dopaminergic
activity in discrete brain areas relevant for a reward-directed behavior.

Role of AP-1 in ethanol-induced N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2B subunit gene
up-regulation in mouse cortical neurons.

Activator protein 1 (AP-1) has been reported to regulate the gene expression in a
wide variety of cellular processes in response to stimuli. In this study, we
investigated the DNA-protein binding activities and promoter activity in the
N-methyl-D-aspartate R2B (NR2B) gene AP-1 site in normal and ethanol-treated
cultured neurons. The identity of the AP-1 site as the functional binding factor 
is suggested by the specific binding of nuclear extract derived from cultured
cortical neurons to the labeled probes and the specific antibody-induced
supershift. Mutations in the core sequence resulted in a significantly reduced
promoter activity and the ability to compete for the binding. Moreover, treatment
of the cultured neuron with 75 mm ethanol for 5 days caused a significant
increase in the AP-1 binding activity and promoter activity. The AP-1 DNA-binding
complex in control and ethanol-treated nuclear extract was composed of c-Fos,
FosB, c-Jun, JunD, and phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB). Western blot analysis showed
that p-CREB and FosB significantly increased, whereas c-Jun decreased. The DNA
affinity precipitation assay indicated that FosB, p-CREB, and c-Jun increased in 
the AP-1 complex following ethanol treatment. These results suggest that AP-1 is 
an active regulator of the NR2B transcription and ethanol-induced changes may
result at multiple levels in the regulation including AP-1 proteins expression,
CREB phosphorylation and perhaps reorganization of dimmers.

Education, Xi'an Jiaotong University, China. wanghuiling63@163.com

The present study sought to assess whether the blockade of ionotropic glutamate
receptors in the ventral tegmental area could modulate morphine withdrawal in
morphine-dependent rats and the expression of stable DeltaFosB isoforms in the
nucleus accumbens during morphine withdrawal. Rats were injected (i.p.) with
increasing doses of morphine for 1 week to develop physical dependence, and
withdrawal was then precipitated by one injection of naloxone (2 mg/kg, i.p.).
Abstinence signs such as jumping, wet-dog shake, writhing posture, weight loss,
and Gellert-Holtzman scale score were recorded to evaluate naloxone-induced
morphine withdrawal. Two ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists, dizocilpine
(MK-801) and 6, 7-dinitroquinnoxaline-2, 3-dione (DNQX), were microinjected
unilaterally into the ventral tegmental area 30 min before naloxone
precipitation. A second injection of naloxone (2 mg/kg i.p.) was given 1 h after 
the first naloxone injection to sustain a maximal level of withdrawal so that the
expression of stable DeltaFosB isoforms in the nucleus accumbens could be
measured. This would enable determination of the correlation between the MK-801
or DNQX-induced decrease in somatic withdrawal signs and the change in neuronal
activity in the nucleus accumbens. The results showed that both MK-801 and DNQX
significantly alleviated all symptoms of morphine withdrawal except for weight
loss and reduced the expression of stable DeltaFosB isoforms within the nucleus
accumbens. These data suggest that ionotropic glutamatergic neurotransmission in 
the ventral tegmental area regulates the levels of stable DeltaFosB isoforms in
the nucleus accumbens, which play a very important role in modulating opiate
withdrawal.

Stomatology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310006, China.

OBJECTIVE: To observe activating protein-1 (AP- 1) members in response to changes
of wall-shear stress in osteoblastic cells in vitro.
METHODS: Isolated and purified osteoblastic cells from the calvaria of newborn SD
rats were cultured and subcultured. The third generation cells were subjected to 
wall-shear stress of 0.8 Pa, 1.2 Pa, 1.4 Pa and 1.6 Pa separately. Gene
expression of the seven AP-1 members were studied before (0 h) and 10 min, 15
min, 30 min, 60 min after treated with wall-shear stress.
RESULTS: The expression of FosB, c-Fos, c-Jun, JunD and JunB mRNA increased
transiently after application of 1.2 Pa wall-shear stress in osteoblastic cells
compared to 0.8 Pa , 1.4 Pa and 1.6 Pa stress, and peaked at 15 min.
CONCLUSION: Mechanical environment changes in osteoblastic cells induced a
dramatic induction of most of the AP-1 members.

extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway.

Extracellular signal-regulated kinases and activator protein 1 transcription
factor have been functionally linked to addiction. It has also been shown that
extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation can regulate cocaine-induced
expression of c-Fos and FosB, two possible components of activator protein 1. A
direct link between extracellular signal-regulated kinases and activator protein 
1 activation has, however, remained unexplored. In this study, we investigated
the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinases in the regulation of
DNA-binding activity and composition of activator protein 1 induced in the mouse 
caudate putamen by cocaine treatment. We have found that pre-treatment with
SL327, a selective inhibitor the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway,
has no influence on cocaine-induced DNA-binding activity of activator protein 1, 
when examined one hour after an acute cocaine treatment. This phenomenon results 
from simultaneous decrease of c-Fos protein level and increases in JunB and
deltaFosB protein levels. SL327 pre-treatment, however, reduces the DNA-binding
activity of the activator protein 1 complex induced six hours after an acute
cocaine treatment as well as one hour after the last of the chronic cocaine
injections, a phenomenon that results from the concomitant reduction of all
cocaine-induced proteins (c-Fos, FosB, deltaFosB, JunB). In conclusion, we have
found that extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibition may not only
interfere with cocaine-induced gene expression and activator protein 1 complex
activation, but may also disturb the time-course of gene expression and
composition of activator protein 1 complex. Our results support the notion that
inhibitors of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway could be valuable
tools to obliterate cocaine-induced molecular changes and the development of
addiction.

oblongata after baroreceptor stimulation.

The medulla oblongata is the site of central baroreceptive neurons in mammals.
These neurons express specific basic-leucine zipper transcription factors (bZIP) 
after baroreceptor stimulation. Previously we showed that activation of
baroreceptors induced expression of nuclear transcription factors c-Fos and FosB 
in central baroreceptive neurons. Here we studied the effects of baroreceptor
stimulation on induction of MafG, a member of small Maf protein family that
functions as dimeric partners for various bZIP transcription factors by forming
transcription-regulating complexes, in the rat medulla oblongata. To determine
whether gene expression of MafG is induced by stimulation of arterial
baroreceptors, we examined the expression of its mRNA by semi-quantitative
reverse transcription-PCR method and its gene product by immunohistochemistry. We
found that the number of MafG transcripts increased significantly in the medulla 
oblongata after baroreceptor stimulation. MafG-immunoreactive neurons were
distributed in the nucleus tractus solitarii, the dorsal motor nucleus of the
vagus nerve, the ambiguous nucleus and the ventrolateral medulla. The numbers of 
MafG-immunoreactive neurons in these nuclei were significantly greater in test
rats than in saline-injected control rats. We also found approximately 20% of
MafG-immunoreactive neurons coexpress FosB after baroreceptor stimulation. Our
results suggest that MafG cooperates with FosB to play critical roles as an
immediate early gene in the signal transduction of cardiovascular regulation
mediated by baroreceptive signals in the medulla oblongata.

Intronic regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 revealed by in vivo
transcriptional analysis in ischemia.

Francisco, CA 94121, USA.

Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) plays an essential role in angiogenesis and
arteriogenesis, two processes critical to restoration of tissue perfusion after
ischemia. MMP-2 expression is increased in tissue ischemia, but the responsible
mechanisms remain unknown. We studied the transcriptional activation of the MMP-2
gene in a model of hindlimb ischemia by using various MMP-2-lacZ reporter mice
and chromatin immunoprecipitation. MMP-2 activity and mRNA were increased after
hindlimb ischemia. Mice with targeted deletion of MMP-2 had impaired restoration 
of perfusion and a high incidence of limb gangrene, indicating that MMP-2 plays a
critical role in ischemia-induced revascularization. Ischemia induced the
expression and binding of c-Fos, c-Jun, JunB, FosB, and Fra2 to a noncanonical
activating protein-1 (AP-1) site present in the MMP-2 promoter and decreased
binding of the transcriptional repressor JunD. Ischemia also activated the
expression and binding of p53 to an adjacent enhancer site (RE-1) and increased
expression and binding of nuclear factor of activated T-cells-c2 to consensus
sequences within the first intron. Deletion of either the 5' AP-1/RE-1 region of 
the promoter or substitution of the first intron abolished ischemia-induced MMP-2
transcription in vivo. Thus, AP-1 transcription factors and intronic activation
by nuclear factor of activated T-cells-c2 act in concert to drive
ischemia-induced MMP-2 transcription. These findings define a critical role for
MMP-2 in ischemia-induced revascularization and identify both previously
uncharacterized regulatory elements within the MMP-2 gene and the cognate
transcription factors required for MMP-2 activation in vivo after tissue
ischemia.

Coordinated and spatial upregulation of arc in striatonigral neurons correlates
with L-dopa-induced behavioral sensitization in dyskinetic rats.

Although oral administration of L-Dopa remains the best therapy for Parkinson
disease, its long-term administration causes the appearance of abnormal
involuntary movements such as dyskinesia. Although persistent striatal induction 
of some genes has already been associated with such pathologic profiles in
hemiparkinsonian rats, molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying such
long-term adaptations remain to be elucidated. In this study, using a rat model
of L-Dopa-induced dyskinesia, we report that activity regulated cytoskeletal
(Arc)-associated protein is strongly upregulated in the lesioned striatum and
that the extent of its induction further varies according to the occurrence or
absence of locomotor sensitization. Moreover, Arc is preferentially induced,
along with FosB, nur77, and homer-1a, in striatonigral neurons, which express
mRNA encoding the precursor of dynorphin. Given the likely importance of Arc in
the regulation of cytoskeleton during synaptic plasticity, its upregulation
supports the hypothesis that a relationship exists between cytoskeletal
modifications and the longlasting action of chronically administrated L-Dopa.

The rewarding properties of cocaine were assessed in adult rats submitted to a
protein malnutrition schedule from the 14th day of gestation up to 40 days of age
(deprived rats), as compared with well-nourished animals (control rats) using the
conditioned place preference paradigm. Dose-response curves to cocaine (3, 5, 10,
15, 30, 45 or 60 mg/kg i.p.) revealed in deprived rats a conditioning effect with
doses of 5 and 10mg/kg; doses of 15 and 30 mg/kg did not show any conditioning
place preference and doses of 45 and 60 mg/kg revealed a significant aversive
effect. In control rats, cocaine elicited place preference with doses of 10, 15
and 30 mg/kg, whereas 45 and 60 mg/kg did not show either conditioning or
aversive effects. Furthermore, sensitization to the conditioning effect of
cocaine was obtained in deprived animals with a low dosage of cocaine, that was
ineffective in controls (5 mg/kg/day for 10 days). Related to the higher
rewarding effects, sensitized deprived rats showed a selective and significant
increase in FosB expression in nucleus accumbens (core and shell) and basolateral
amygdala, brain areas related to the rewarding neuronal circuits. These results
suggest that a deficient nutritional status during early life may induce in adult
subjects an increased responsiveness to behavioral effects of cocaine and/or
enhanced its reinforcement properties.

Members of the Fos family (c-Fos, FosB and its smaller splice variants, Fra-1 and
Fra-2) dimerise with Jun proteins to form the AP-1 transcription factor complex. 
Based on the rapidly growing amount of data from experimental studies, animal
models and investigations on clinical tumour samples, this review summarises the 
current knowledge about the role of these proteins in carcinogenesis. In addition
to c-Fos, which has oncogenic activity and is frequently overexpressed in tumour 
cells, Fra-1 seems to play a role in the progression of many carcinomas. The
results obtained from various studies show different implications for these
transcription factors according to tumour type, i.e., Fra-1 overexpression
enhances the motility and invasion of breast and colorectal cancer cells, but
inhibits the tumourigenicity of cervical carcinoma cell lines. Knowledge about
regulation of invasion and metastasis in different malignant tumours in vivo
might open promising perspectives to targeted therapeutic approaches.

Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) plays critical roles in glutathione
homeostasis and metabolism. Rat GGT is a single-copy gene from which seven types 
of GGT mRNA with a common protein encoding sequence, but different
5'-untranslated regions, may be transcribed. We previously showed that type V-2
was the predominant form of GGT mRNA in rat L2 epithelial cells, and that it
could be induced by 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) through the electrophile response
element (EpRE) located in GGT promoter 5 (GP5). Here, we report transcription
factors binding to GP5 EpRE and the involved signaling pathways. Immunodepletion 
gel shift assays demonstrated that GP5 EpRE bound JunB, c-Jun, FosB, and Fra2
from unstimulated cells, and that after exposure to HNE, EpRE binding complexes
contained nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf) 1, Nrf2, JunB, c-Jun,
FosB, c-Fos, Fra1, and Fra2. HNE-induced binding of Nrf2 and c-Jun in GP5 EpRE
was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Using reporter assays and 
specific inhibitors, we found that HNE induction of rat GGT mRNA V-2 was
dependent on activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but not protein kinase C or
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Pretreatment with ERK and p38MAPK inhibitors also 
blocked HNE-increased EpRE binding. HNE-increased nuclear content of Nrf1, Nrf2, 
and c-Jun in L2 cells was partially blocked by inhibition of either ERK1/2 or
p38MAPK and completely blocked by simultaneous inhibition of both MAPKs. In
conclusion, HNE induces GGT mRNA V-2 through altered EpRE transcription factor
binding mediated by both ERK and p38MAPK.

OBJECTIVE: To detect target genes for further study by way of analyzing the gene 
expression profiles of benzene poisoning by using cDNA microarray.
METHODS: Peripheral mononuclear cells were isolated from seven patients with
benzene poisoning of different degrees, and sevene age-and sex-matched normal
subjects. Total RNA was extracted and purified, followed by revese transcription 
to cDNAs with concomitant incorporation of fluorescent dCTP (Cy3 or Cy5). The
cDNAs were used as probes in microarray of 2780 cloned cDNA. Fluorescent signals 
were scanned to detect genes differentially expressed in patients and normal
subjects.
RESULTS: Among 7 pieces of cDNA microarray of 2780 tumour related genes, the
expression of 16 genes, such as GRO1, TGFBR3, LYN ctc was upregulated, whereas
the expression of 28 genes, such as FOSB, DJ-1, MCT-1 etc was down-regulated.
CONCLUSION: Abnormal expression of tumour related genes of patients exposed to
benzene suggests that they may be the key genes, which play important role in
benzene-induced leucocythemia. cDNA microarray technique is useful to indicate
the expression mode of benzene poisoning tumour related genes, and to find
rapidly and effectively new research object and the way of gene therapy.

Gene expression profiling reveals a signaling role of glutathione in redox
regulation.

Proteins can form reversible mixed disulfides with glutathione (GSH). It has been
hypothesized that protein glutathionylation may represent a mechanism of redox
regulation, in a fashion similar to that mediated by protein phosphorylation. We 
investigated whether GSH has a signaling role in the response of HL60 cells to
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), in addition to its obvious antioxidant role. We
identified early changes in gene expression induced at different times by H2O2
treatment, under conditions that increase protein glutathionylation and minimal
toxicity. We then investigated the effect of prior GSH depletion by buthionine
sulfoximine and diethylmaleate on this response. The analysis revealed 2,016
genes regulated by H2O2. Of these, 215 genes showed GSH-dependent expression
changes, classifiable into four clusters displaying down- or up-regulation by
H2O2, either potentiated or inhibited by GSH depletion. The modulation of 20
selected genes was validated by real-time RT-PCR. The biological process
categories overrepresented in the largest cluster (genes whose up-regulation was 
inhibited by GSH depletion) were NF-kappaB activation, transcription, and DNA
methylation. This cluster also included several cytokine and chemokine ligands
and receptors, the redox regulator thioredoxin interacting protein, and the
histone deacetylase sirtuin. The cluster of genes whose up-regulation was
potentiated by GSH depletion included two HSPs (HSP40 and HSP70) and the AP-1
transcription factor components Fos and FosB. This work demonstrates that GSH, in
addition to its antioxidant and protective function against oxidative stress, has
a specific signaling role in redox regulation.

c-Fos degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway in osteoclast
progenitors.

c-Fos is an immediate early gene type proto-oncogene that belongs to the AP
(activator protein)-1 transcription factor family. Gene knockout experiments have
demonstrated that, among the Fos family, only c-Fos is indispensable for
osteoclast differentiation but that c-Fos can be substituted for by other Fos
family members including FosB/DeltaFosB, Fra-1 and Fra-2, in most other tissues
and cells. To further understand a unique role of c-Fos in osteoclastogenesis, we
investigated the temporal profile and regulatory mode of expression of c-Fos
during the course of osteoclast differentiation. The results indicated that c-Fos
protein gradually increased in preosteoclasts during differentiation to a greater
extent than that of mRNA induction. We then determined the proteolytic pathway of
c-Fos conferring unstable nature on c-Fos protein in a preosteoclastic cell line,
RAW264.7. Proteasome inhibitors including MG132 and Z-LLF caused a rapid increase
in c-Fos protein expression in these cells within several hours, but other
inhibitors of cysteine protease (E-64), lysosome (chloroquine) and calpain (ALLM)
did not. Moreover, the proteasome inhibitors caused an extensive accumulation of 
ubiquitinated c-Fos protein and an approximately three-fold extension of the
c-Fos protein half-life. We therefore conclude that the ubiquitin-proteasome
system is the major proteolytic pathway conferring instability on c-Fos protein
in preosteoclasts. Our results further imply that c-Fos stabilization due to
dynamic changes in the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation may be involved
in the accumulation of c-Fos protein in differentiating preosteoclasts.

ERK phosphorylation and FosB expression are associated with L-DOPA-induced
dyskinesia in hemiparkinsonian mice.

Pavón N(1), Martín AB, Mendialdua A, Moratalla R.

Author information: 
(1)Instituto Cajal, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, Madrid,
Spain.

BACKGROUND: The dopamine precursor 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (L-DOPA) is
currently the most efficacious noninvasive therapy for Parkinson's disease. A
major complication of this therapy, however, is the appearance of the abnormal
involuntary movements known as dyskinesias. We have developed a model of
L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias in mice that reproduces the main clinical features of 
dyskinesia in humans.
METHODS: Dyskinetic symptoms were triggered by repetitive administration of a
constant dose of L-DOPA (25 mg/kg, twice a day, for 25 days) in unilaterally
6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned mice. Mice were examined for behavior,
expression of FosB, neuropeptides, and externally regulated kinase (ERK)
phosphorylation.
RESULTS: Dyskinetic symptoms appear toward the end of the first week of treatment
and are associated with L-DOPA-induced changes in DeltaFosB and prodynorphin
expression. L-DOPA also induces activation of ERK1/2 in the dopamine-depleted
striatum. Interestingly, elevated FosB/DeltaFosB expression occurs exclusively
within completely lesioned regions of the striatum, displaying an inverse
correlation with remaining dopaminergic terminals. Following acute L-DOPA
treatment, FosB expression occurs in direct striatal output neurons, whereas
chronic L-DOPA also induces FosB expression in nitric oxide synthase-positive
striatal interneurons.
CONCLUSIONS: This model provides a system in which genetic manipulation of
individual genes can be used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible
for the development and expression of dyskinesia.

Rats that have sustained bilateral excitotoxic lesions of the ventral hippocampus
(VH) as neonates develop behavioral abnormalities as adults (hyper-responsiveness
to stress, diminished prepulse inhibition, and increased sensitivity to dopamine 
agonists), which resemble certain aspects of schizophrenia. Although this
behavioral profile is thought to reflect dysregulation of the mesolimbic dopamine
system, the precise neuroanatomical and neurochemical substrates that mediate the
emergence of these abnormalities during brain maturation are unclear. In order to
identify putative sites responsible for the development of behavioral
abnormalities following neonatal lesions of the VH, we utilized the chronic
neuronal activity marker DeltaFosB. By comparison to sham lesioned animals,
bilateral destruction of the VH elevated DeltaFosB expression throughout the
caudate putamen and neocortex of animals lesioned as neonates. These increases
were not observed in rats lesioned as young-adults, suggesting that DeltaFosB
induction in the cortex of neonatally lesioned rats may be related to altered
cortical neurodevelopment. Accumulating evidence implicates DeltaFosB in
mediation of the long-lasting effects of altered dopaminergic neurotransmission
on behavior. The present findings are consistent with this proposal and suggest
that elevated expression of DeltaFosB identifies overactive neurons that may
contribute to the enhanced sensitivity to stress and dopaminergic agonists of
rats that have sustained bilateral ventral hippocampal lesions as neonates.

Activation of mu-opioid receptors in the ventral pallidum (VP) is important for
the induction of behavioral sensitization to morphine in rats. The present study 
was designed to ascertain if neurons within the VP demonstrate sensitization at a
time when morphine-induced behavioral sensitization occurred (ie 3 or 14 days
after five once-daily injections of 10 mg/kg i.p. morphine) in rats. Western
blotting was used to evaluate transcription factors altered by opiates, CREB and 
deltaFosB. CREB levels did not change in the VP, but there was a significant
decrease in levels of its active, phosphorylated form (pCREB) at both 3- and
14-days withdrawal. DeltaFosB levels were elevated following a 3-day withdrawal, 
but returned to normal by 14 days. This profile also was obtained from nucleus
accumbens tissue. In a separate group of similarly treated rats, in vivo
electrophysiological recordings of VP neuronal responses to
microiontophoretically applied ligands were carried out after 14-days withdrawal.
The firing rate effects of local applications of morphine were diminished in rats
withdrawn from i.p. morphine. Repeated i.p. morphine did not alter GABA-mediated 
suppression of firing, or the rate enhancing effects of the D1 dopamine receptor 
agonist SKF82958 or glutamate. However, VP neurons from rats withdrawn from
repeated i.p. morphine showed a higher propensity to enter a state of
depolarization inactivation to locally applied glutamate. Overall, these findings
reveal that decreased pCREB in brain regions such as the VP accompanies
persistent behavioral sensitization to morphine and that this biochemical
alteration may influence the excitability of neurons in this brain region.

The development of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is known to be a
causative risk factor in the evolution of adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus. The
major component of this reflux is gastric acid. However, the impact of low pH on 
gene expression has not been extensively studied in oesophageal cells. This study
utilizes a transcriptomic and bioinformatic approach to assess regulation of gene
expression in response to low pH. In more detail, oesophageal adenocarcinoma cell
lines were exposed to a range of pH environments. Affymetrix microarrays were
used for gene-expression analysis and results were validated using cycle
limitation and real-time RT-PCR analysis, as well as northern and western
blotting. Comparative promoter transcription factor binding site (TFBS) analysis 
(MatInspector) of hierarchically clustered gene-expression data was employed to
identify the elements which may co-ordinately regulate individual gene clusters. 
Initial experiments demonstrated maximal induction of EGR1 gene expression at pH 
6.5. Subsequent array experimentation revealed significant induction of gene
expression from such functional categories as DNA damage response (EGR1-4, ATF3) 
and cell-cycle control (GADD34, GADD45, p57). Changes in expression of EGR1,
EGR3, ATF3, MKP-1, FOSB, CTGF and CYR61 were verified in separate experiments and
in a variety of oesophageal cell lines. TFBS analysis of promoters identified
transcription factors that may co-ordinately regulate gene-expression clusters,
Cluster 1: Oct-1, AP4R; Cluster 2: NF-kB, EGRF; Cluster 3: IKRS, AP-1F. Low pH
has the ability to induce genes and pathways which can provide an environment
suitable for the progression of malignancy. Further functional analysis of the
genes and clusters identified in this low pH study is likely to lead to new
insights into the pathogenesis and therapeutics of GORD and oesophageal cancer.

Activation of ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase in human cells by the
mycotoxin patulin.

Wu TS(1), Yu FY, Su CC, Kan JC, Chung CP, Liu BH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Life Sciences, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.

Patulin (PAT), a mycotoxin produced by certain species of Penicillium and
Aspergillus, is often detectable in moldy fruits and their derivative products.
PAT led to a concentration-dependent and time-dependent increase in
phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2
(ERK1/2) in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Exposure
of HEK293 cells to concentrations above 5 microM PAT for 30 min induced ERK1/2
phosphorylation; activation of ERK1/2 was also observed after 24 h incubation
with 0.05 microM of PAT. Treatment of human PBMCs for 30 min with 30 microM PAT
dramatically increased the phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels. Both MEK1/2 inhibitors, 
U0126 and PD98059, suppressed ERK1/2 activation in either HEK293 or MDCK cells.
In HEK293 cells, U0126-mediated inhibition of PAT-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation 
resulted in a significant decrease in levels of DNA damage, expressed as tail
moment values, in the single cell gel electrophoresis assay. Conversely, U0126
did not affect cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase release, and the DNA
synthesis rate in PAT-treated cultures. Exposure of HEK293 cells for 90 min to 15
microM PAT elevated the levels of early growth response gene-1 (egr-1) mRNA, but 
not of c-fos, fosB, and junB mRNAs. These results indicate that in human cells,
PAT causes a rapid and persistent activation of ERK1/2 and this signaling pathway
plays an important role in mediating PAT-induced DNA damage and egr-1 gene
expression.

Dyskinesias are a common consequence of dopaminergic therapy in patients with
Parkinson's disease. Little is known about the influence of cellular replacement 
strategies upon drug-induced dyskinesias. In the current study, we employed
parkinsonian rats to test whether the distribution of dopamine neuron grafts
could differentially alter striatal circuitry and levodopa-induced dyskinesias.
Specifically, we compared behavioral and neurochemical consequences of dopamine
reinnervation restricted to a focal region of the striatum to innervation
encompassing the majority of the striatum by distributing the same number of
cells into single locus or multiple locations. Both the single-site and
widespread grafts reduced pregraft dyskinesias and normalized FosB/DeltaFosB in
the dorsal two-thirds of the lateral striatum. However, single-site DA graft
recipients developed a robust, novel forelimb-facial stereotypy and upregulated
FosB/DeltaFosB expression in the ventrolateral striatum, an area associated with 
movements of tongue and forelimbs. The onset of forelimb-facial stereotypy
correlated with measures of increased graft function.

Cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with carotid body adaptations to
chronic hypoxia.

Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA. nrp@po.cwru.edu

Chronic hypoxia leads to adaptations in the respiratory system manifested as a
persistent increase in resting ventilation, termed ventilatory acclimatization to
hypoxia (VAH). Increased afferent nerve activity from carotid bodies and the
ensuing reflex activation of ventilation are critical for eliciting VAH. In this 
review we highlight recent information on the cellular and molecular mechanisms
associated with chronic hypoxia-induced functional and structural changes in the 
carotid body. Chronic hypoxia leads to hypersensitivity of the carotid bodies and
induces morphological changes, including enlargement of the organ, hyperplasia of
glomus cells, and neovascularization. Enhanced hypoxic sensitivity is due to
alterations in ion current densities, as well as changes in neurotransmitter
dynamics and recruitment of additional neuromodulators (endothelin- 1, ET-1) in
glomus cells. Morphological alterations are in part due to upregulation of growth
factors (e.g., VEGF). VAH is markedly attenuated in mice partially deficient in
HIF-1 transcription factor, which regulates several downstream genes, including
VEGF, ET-1, and Ca(2+) channels. The finding that VAH is also blunted in mice
deficient in the fosB gene led to the suggestion that the magnitude and time
course of VAH depend on complex interactions between more than one transcription 
factor, resulting in coordinated regulation of several downstream genes and their
protein products.

The activating protein-1 (AP-1) family of transcription factors has been
implicated in the control of proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes, 
but its role in malignant transformation is not clear. The aim of this study is
to assess the pattern of mRNA expression of jun-fos AP-1 family members in 45
samples of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and matched adjacent
mucosa by means of Northern blot analysis. Transcripts of all family members were
identified, except for JunB that was detected only by means of reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction. Neither c-Fos nor JunD or FosB mRNA
differed between tumours and normal tissues. We observed a strong Fos-related
antigen-1 (Fra-1) and Fra-2 expression, but only Fra-1 mRNA densitometric values 
were higher in tumour, compared to normal adjacent mucosa (t-test, P = 0.006). A 
direct relationship between the positive expression of Fra-1 mRNA, above tumour
median, was associated with the presence of compromised lymph nodes (Fischer
exact test, P = 0.006). In addition, Fra-1 protein staining was assessed in a
collection of 180 tumours and 29 histologically normal samples adjacent to
tumours in a tissue array. Weak reactivity, restricted to the basal cell layer,
was detected in 79% of tumour adjacent normal tissues, opposed to the intense
reactivity of cancer tissues. In the subgroup of oral cancers, we have observed a
shift in Fra-1 immunoreactivity, as long as the number of patients in each
category, cytoplasmic or nuclear/cytoplasmic staining, was analysed (Fischer
exact test, P = 0.0005). Thus, Fra-1 gene induction and accumulation of Fra-1
protein may contribute to the neoplastic phenotype in HNSCC.

Regulation of the neuronal fate by DeltaFosB and its downstream target,
galectin-1.

In mammals, the regulation of the cell fate to either proliferate, differentiate,
arrest cell growth, or initiate programmed cell death is the most fundamental
mechanism for maintaining normal cell function and tissue homeostasis. Under
multiple signaling pathways, Jun and Fos family proteins are known to play
important roles as components of an AP-1 (activator protein-1) complex, to
regulate the transcription of various genes involved in cell proliferation,
differentiation and programmed cell death. DeltaFosB, one of the AP-1 subunits
encoded by alternatively spliced fosB mRNA, triggers one round of proliferation
in quiescent rat embryo cell lines, followed by a different cell fate such as
morphological alteration or delayed cell death. As one of the downstream targets 
of the DeltaFosB in rat3Y1 cell line, we identified rat galectin-1 and its novel 
variant, galectin-1beta, and demonstrated that the expression of galectin-1 is
required for the proliferative activation of quiescent rat1A cells by DeltaFosB, 
thus indicating that galectin-1 is one of functional targets of DeltaFosB. The
expression of DeltaFosB is highly inducible in the adult brain in response to
various insults such as ischemic reperfusion injury, seizure induced by electric 
stimulation or cocaine administration. On the other hand, galectin-1 has also
been shown to be involved in the regeneration of damaged axons in the peripheral 
nerve, as well as in neurite outgrowth or synaptic connectivity in the olfactory 
system during development. We herein propose that DeltaFosB together with
galectin-1, may therefore mediate neuroprotection and neurogenesis in response to
brain damage.

Sex and tissue-specific differences in low-dose radiation-induced oncogenic
signaling.

PURPOSE: The possible adverse health effects of low-dose radiation (LDR) exposure
constitute a growing concern. Clinically and environmentally relevant exposures
occur predominantly under chronic conditions, notwithstanding that most studies
of LDR effects have been performed using a single acute exposure. Sex- and
tissue-specificity of the LDR-induced changes have not been considered before. We
investigated LDR-related expression patterns in muscle, liver and spleen of male 
and female mice subjected to acute and chronic LDR exposure. Genes involved in
oncogenic signaling were of specific interest, as radiation is a well-known
carcinogen.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the expression pattern of genes coding for
growth factors and growth-factor receptors, cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein 
kinases, G-proteins and nuclear DNA-binding proteins, and other important
components of oncogenic signaling.
RESULTS: We found sex- and tissue-specific changes in the expression of Ras
superfamily members (Nras, Rab2, Rab34, Vav2), protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms
(PKCbeta, PKCmu), AP-1 factor components (Jun, JunB and FosB), Wnt signaling
pathway members as well as in a variety of other cellular proto-oncogenes and
oncogenes. Importantly, Western blot analysis of JunB, PKCmu and Rab2 proteins
supported the transcriptomic data.
CONCLUSIONS: Substantially different protein levels were observed in all three
tissues (muscle, spleen and liver) of acutely and chronically irradiated female
and male animals. Based on the obtained data and available literature, we discuss
several possible mechanisms that may contribute to radiation-induced
carcinogenesis in various tissues of males and females. From our results we could
identify the genes that may serve as sex- and tissue-specific biomarkers of the
LDR exposure.

Bcl-2 promotes invasion and lung metastasis by inducing matrix
metalloproteinase-2.

Erratum in
    Cancer Res. 2006 Jan 15;66(2):1250. Rho, Seung Bae [added].

Bcl-2 is involved in the progression of human malignancies, but the precise role 
and mechanism of Bcl-2 for tumor invasion and metastasis remains unclear. In this
study, we have investigated the role and mechanism of Bcl-2 on tumor cell
invasion and metastasis by using Bcl-2 overexpressing non-small cell lung cancer 
cells. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are important proteins involved in the
processes of tumor invasion and metastasis. In vitro Matrigel invasion assays
showed that Bcl-2 overexpression increased tumor cell invasion by 15-fold.
Moreover, Bcl-2 overexpression enhanced in vivo lung metastasis by 4-fold.
Consistent with its effect on invasion and metastasis, Bcl-2 overexpression
induced not only MMP-2 mRNA and its protein expression, but this also activated
the pro-MMP-2 protein to its active form. To explore the induction mechanism of
MMP-2 by Bcl-2, we investigated the effects of Bcl-2 overexpression on MMP-2
transcriptional regulation. Nuclear run-on assays showed a 6-fold increase in the
transcription rate of MMP-2 mRNA in the Bcl-2 transfectants (H157/Bcl-2) compared
with that of the H157/vector control cells (H157/C). Overexpression of Bcl-2
induced the nuclear transcription factor activator protein 1 family, including
the c-Jun, JunD, c-Fos, FosB, and Fra-1 proteins. Reporter assays combined with
deletion mutagenesis analysis and gel shift assays showed the involvement of
activator protein 1 in the activation of MMP-2 promoter activity by Bcl-2. Taken 
together, we have shown that Bcl-2 promotes tumor invasion and lung metastasis by
inducing MMP-2 gene expression through the combined action of transcriptional and
posttranslational mechanisms.

Behavioral and histopathological analysis of domoic Acid administration in
marmosets.

Perez-Mendes P(1), Cinini SM, Medeiros MA, Tufik S, Mello LE.

Author information:

Brazil.

PURPOSE: To induce status epilepticus (SE) followed by the subsequent onset of
spontaneous recurrent seizures, thus characterizing a new model of temporal lobe 
epilepsy in a nonhuman primate.
METHODS: Male and female marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) (n = 18), ages between 2 
and 8 years, were injected with domoic acid (0.5-4 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline, and
behaviorally assessed with regard to the presence of acutely induced seizures and
for < or = 6 months for spontaneous seizures. Injection of doses ranging from 3.5
to 4 mg/kg either did not induce SE or resulted in fatal SE. Even a 5-min SE
duration (SE blockade resulting from diazepam injection) proved lethal to
marmosets within 1 h of domoate administration, regardless of intensive care and 
monitoring of the animals. Animals injected with doses ranging from 0.5 to 3
mg/kg that developed only a few minor convulsive signs were allowed a 6-month
survival period for the assessment of spontaneous epileptic events. At the end of
the experiment, 6-month period, or acute intoxication associated with SE
induction, animals were deeply anesthetized and had their brains subjected to
histologic processing for Nissl and delta-FosB.
RESULTS: For the animals injected with domoate that did not develop SE (i.e.,
those that survived), we could not detect any behavioral signs of spontaneous
epileptic seizures in the 6-month observation period, and only minor indications 
of neuropathologic changes (i.e., neuronal death) over Nissl-stained sections, as
well as some small changes in the staining for delta-FosB in a few of the
animals.
CONCLUSIONS: Systemic administration of domoic acid to marmosets is not effective
for the generation of a model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Administration
of domoic acid at doses that do not lead to SE also did not lead to the
development of temporal lobe epilepsy or clear-cut behavioral changes over a
6-month period.

Expression pattern of the activating protein-1 family of transcription factors in
gestational trophoblastic lesions.

The human placenta is an endocrine tissue with a unique capacity for rapid, but
tightly controlled, proliferation and invasion. Gestational trophoblastic
diseases (GTDs) are placental pathologies with endocrine activity and partially
malignant potential and include hydatidiform moles, placental site nodules, and
tumors such as placental site trophoblastic tumor and choriocarcinomas. The
activating protein-1 (AP-1) family of transcription factors is composed of the
cellular homologs of the Jun and Fos oncoproteins, which are immediately involved
in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and invasion processes and in the
regulation of endocrine genes. The expression pattern of the AP-1 family in the
normal human placenta has been recently described, where most of the factors were
found in the extravillous (invasive) trophoblast. Their systematic expression in 
GTD has not been studied thus far. For this reason in this study, we investigated
the expression pattern of the AP-1 family in GTDs and compared it with the
expression in normal placenta using immunohistochemistry with specific polyclonal
antibodies against all members of the AP-1 family (JunB, JunD, c-Jun, c-Fos,
FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2). Immunohistochemistry was performed on normal human placentas
(positive control) and on 28 cases of GTD including 7 choriocarcinomas and 21
hydatidiform moles. In the normal placenta and in hydatidiform molar samples,
most AP-1 factors (especially c-Jun, JunD, and Fra2) were expressed in the
intermediate (extravillous) trophoblast. In addition, in molar lesions, strong
expression was found in trophoblasts proliferating from the surface of villi.
There was only a weak expression of JunB and Fra2 in small fractions of villous
cyto- and syncytiotrophoblast nuclei. In choriocarcinomas, there was a strong
expression for c-Jun, JunD, Fra1, and Fra2. The specific localization to
extravillous trophoblasts and their expression pattern in GTDs indicate that the 
AP-1 family of transcription factors might be implicated in regulating
proliferation and invasion of trophoblasts and play a role in the pathogenesis of
GTDs.

IL-5 inhibits apoptosis by upregulation of c-myc expression in human
hematopoietic cells.

Juan SH(1), Yen JJ, Lee HM, Huang HM.

Author information: 
(1)Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Taipei Medical University, Hsinyi
District, Taipei 110, Taiwan.

Interleukin 5 (IL-5) inhibition of apoptosis is required throughout many
hematopoietic lineages to regulate proliferation and differentiation. It is not
clear how IL-5 mediates the intracellular molecular events regulating the
anti-apoptotic effect. The cell lines TF-1 and JYTF-1 expressed different amounts
of the IL-5 receptor alpha (IL-5R alpha) subunit, which caused contrasting
effects in response to IL-5. IL-5 supported the survival but not the
anti-apoptotic activities of TF-1 cells, which have a low expression of IL-5R
alpha. In contrast, IL-5 supported both the survival and the anti-apoptotic
activities of JYTF-1 cells, which overexpressed IL-5R alpha compared to TF-1
cells. In this study, IL-5 stimulation increased Annexin V binding (indicative of
apoptosis) in TF-1 cells and decreased apoptosis in JYTF-1 cells. The
proto-oncogenes c-fos, fosB, and c-jun were not detected, whereas junB was
induced by IL-5 stimulation in both types of cells. Most importantly, IL-5
significantly induced c-myc expression in JYTF-1 cells, but did not in TF-1
cells. These results are consistent with the possibility that IL-5 inhibits
apoptosis in JYTF-1 cells via the upregulation of c-myc expression.

SMAD proteins are involved in apoptosis induction in ventricular cardiomyocytes.

Schneiders D(1), Heger J, Best P, Michael Piper H, Taimor G.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Physiology, Justus-Liebig-University, Aulweg 129 D-35392,
Giessen, Germany.

OBJECTIVE: The transcription factor AP-1 is a mediator of hypertrophic growth and
apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. This puts AP-1 in the center of two important
processes found in the failing heart and implies that variations (i) in the AP-1 
composition itself or (ii) in additional, interacting transcription factors are
responsible for the diverse actions of AP-1. To test this hypothesis, we
performed studies on isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes of rat under
hypertrophy- or apoptosis-inducing conditions.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The NO donor SNAP (100 microM), which is a pro-apoptotic
stimulus in cardiomyocytes, activated AP-1 within 2 h. c-Jun, JunB and FosB are
identified as the main components of this AP-1 complex. This complex formation is
identical to the composition of AP-1 found under hypertrophic growth stimulation 
by phenylephrine (PE, 10 muM). Analysis of other transcription factors able to
interact with AP-1 revealed activation of SMAD activity only during stimulation
with SNAP to 131+/-9.6% (p < 0.05 vs. control, n = 9). The SMAD complex is formed
from SMAD4 and 3. Intracellular scavenging of SMAD proteins by transformation of 
cardiomyocytes with SMAD decoy oligonucleotides or inhibition of SMAD4 synthesis 
using SMAD4 antisense oligonucleotides reduced the number of apoptotic cells
under stimulation with SNAP from 13.3 +/- 1.2% to control levels (8 +/- 1%, p <
0.05, n = 6). TGFbeta, which is a known stimulator of SMAD proteins, is also
shown to stimulate apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. Again, simultaneous activation of
AP-1 and SMAD is needed for this apoptosis induction.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, AP-1/SMAD signaling has been identified as a common
pathway in cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In contrast, SMAD proteins are dispensable
for AP-1-mediated hypertrophic growth. This finding characterizes SMAD proteins
as potential candidates for proteins that shift AP-1 signaling from hypertrophy
to apoptosis.

DeltaFosB accumulates in a GABAergic cell population in the posterior tail of the
ventral tegmental area after psychostimulant treatment.

The transcription factor deltaFosB is induced in the nucleus accumbens and dorsal
striatum by chronic exposure to several drugs of abuse, and increasing evidence
supports the possibility that this induction is involved in the addiction
process. However, to date there has been no report of deltaFosB induction by
drugs of abuse in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which is also a critical
brain reward region. In the present study, we used immunohistochemistry to
demonstrate that chronic forced administration of cocaine induces deltaFosB in
the rat VTA. This induction occurs selectively in a gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABA) cell population within the posterior tail of the VTA. A similar effect is 
seen after chronic cocaine self-administration. Induction of deltaFosB in the VTA
occurs after psychostimulant treatment only: it is seen with both chronic cocaine
and amphetamine, but not with chronic opiates or stress. The expression of
deltaFosB appears to be mediated by dopamine systems, as repeated administration 
of a dopamine uptake inhibitor induced deltaFosB in the VTA, while administration
of serotonin or norepinephrine uptake inhibitors failed to produce this effect.
Time course analysis showed that, following 14 days of cocaine administration,
deltaFosB persists in the VTA for almost 2 weeks after cocaine withdrawal. This
accumulation and persistence may account for some of the long-lasting changes in 
the brain associated with chronic drug use. These results provide the first
evidence of deltaFosB induction in a discrete population of GABA cells in the
VTA, which may regulate the functioning of the brain's reward mechanisms.

Forebrain patterns of c-Fos and FosB induction during cancer-associated
anorexia-cachexia in rat.

Linköping, S-581 85 Linköping, Sweden. konsman@bordeaux.inserm.fr

Forebrain structures are necessary for the initiation of food intake and its
coupling to energy expenditure. The cancer-related anorexia-cachexia syndrome is 
typified by a prolonged increase in metabolic rate resulting in body weight loss 
which, paradoxically, is accompanied by reduced food intake. The aim of the
present work was to study the forebrain expression of Fos proteins as activation 
markers and thus to identify potential neurobiological mechanisms favouring
catabolic processes or modulating food intake in rats suffering from
cancer-related anorexia-cachexia. Neurons in forebrain structures showing most
pronounced induction of Fos proteins were further identified neurochemically. To 
provoke anorexia-cachexia, cultured Morris hepatoma 7777 cells were injected
subcutaneously in Buffalo rats. This resulted in a slowly growing tumour inducing
approximately 7% body weight loss and a 20% reduction in food intake when the
tumour represented 1-2% of body mass. Anorexia-cachexia in these animals was
found to be accompanied by Fos induction in several hypothalamic nuclei including
the paraventricular and ventromedial hypothalamus, in the parastrial nucleus, the
amygdala, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, ventral striatal structures
and the piriform and somatosensory cortices. Neurochemical identification
revealed that the vast majority of FosB-positive neurons in the nucleus
accumbens, ventral caudate-putamen and other ventral striatal structures
contained prodynorphin or proenkephalin mRNA. These findings indicate that
forebrain structures that are part of neuronal networks modulating catabolic
pathways and food ingestion are activated during tumour-associated
anorexia-cachexia and may contribute to the lack of compensatory eating in
response to weight loss characterizing this syndrome.

We immunohistochemically examined 75 human colorectal neoplasms (adenoma, 27;
adenocarcinoma, 24; neuroendocrine carcinoma, 24) for the expression of activator
protein (AP)-1 family proteins. Nuclear and cytoplasmic expression levels of
c-Jun and Fra-1 proteins were markedly elevated in adenomas, adenocarcinomas and 
neuroendocrine carcinomas compared with nonneoplastic colorectal epithelial
cells. JunB also was overexpressed in these tumors but with a predominantly
cytoplasmic staining pattern. Overexpression of Fra-2 was evident in carcinomas
but less frequent in adenomas. Expression levels of JunD and c-Fos were high in
nonneoplastic colorectal epithelial cells and remained so in neoplasms. FosB was 
undetectable in nonneoplastic and neoplastic colorectal tissues. Neuroendocrine
carcinomas exhibited an AP-1 expression profile similar to adenocarcinomas except
for infrequent overexpression of c-Jun in poorly differentiated variants.
Hierarchical clustering separated the majority of malignant from benign tumors
based on AP-1 expression patterns. AP-1 transcription factor family members are
expressed differentially in nonneoplastic and neoplastic colorectal tissues.
Up-regulation of c-Jun and Fra-1 is an early event in human colorectal
tumorigenesis. Overexpression of Fra-2 may participate in tumor progression.

Methylphenidate differentially regulates c-fos and fosB expression in the
developing rat striatum.

Methylphenidate (MPH, Ritalin) is a psychostimulant drug used in very young
children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). To explore the
central effects of MPH, we compared repeated MPH treatments on c-fos and fosB
expression in the striatum of immature and adult rats. Prepubertal (PD25-38) or
adult (PD53-66) male rats were treated once daily for: (a) 14 days with either
saline or MPH (2 or 10 mg/kg) or (b) 13 days with saline followed by a single
dose of MPH (2 or 10 mg/kg) on day 14. To determine long-term effects of MPH,
another group of prepubertal rats was allowed a drug-free period of 4 weeks
following the initial 14 days of treatment, and received a challenge dose of MPH 
at adulthood. All rats were sacrificed 2 h post-injection on the final day.
Expression of c-fos and fosB was quantified by densitometric analysis of cFOS and
FOSB-immunoreactivity (-ir). We demonstrated that FOSB-ir was increased by a
single dose of MPH in the prepubertal and adult striatum, and this effect was
further elevated by chronic MPH in prepubertal rats, in contrast to the
inhibitory effect of MPH (2 and 10 mg/kg) on cFOS-ir. In adult rats, repeated MPH
down-regulated cFOS-ir only at the higher dose (10 mg/kg), while fosB expression 
remained at levels comparable to acute MPH. The reduction in cFOS-ir observed in 
prepubertal rats given repeated MPH (10 mg/kg) persisted in the adult striatum
following MPH challenge at adulthood. Our results suggest that (1) repeated MPH
treatment differentially regulates c-fos and fosB expression in the immature and 
adult brain; (2) MPH-induced changes in gene expression may be enduring, and (3) 
the immature brain is more sensitive to the stimulant effects of MPH than the
adult. Thus, our findings have implications for the long-term use of MPH in ADHD.

Our previous studies demonstrated the ability of exogenous agmatine to inhibit
tolerance to and physical dependence on morphine in mice, rats and monkeys. The
present study further evaluated the effect of agmatine on the psychological
dependence induced by morphine in conditioned place preference assay. Agmatine
(0.75-20 mg/kg, s.c.) co-administered with morphine during the conditioning
sessions completely abolished the acquisition of morphine-induced conditioned
place preference in rats, which was associated with activation of imidazoline
receptors. Agmatine (0.75-10 mg/kg, s.c.) administered on the test day inhibited 
the expression of the place preference. After 30 days of extinction of
conditioned place preference, agmatine 2.5 and 40 mg/kg inhibited the priming
effect of morphine 0.5 mg/kg on the place preference. Furthermore, agmatine
inhibited the increased expression of FosB in the nucleus accumbens caused by
chronic morphine. All these results suggest that agmatine could inhibit
morphine-induced psychological dependence and relapses by affecting the
expression of transcription factor FosB.

We studied the effects of osmotic stimulation on the expression of FosB and c-Fos
in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Adult male
rats were divided into two groups that were injected with lidocaine (0.1-0.2 ml
sc) followed by either 0.9% or 6% NaCl (1 ml/100 g bw sc). After the NaCl
injections, the rats were anesthetized and perfused 2, 6, or 8 h after the
injections. Their brains were prepared for immunocytochemistry and stained with
FosB and c-Fos antibodies. The number of c-Fos-positive cells was significantly
increased only at 2 h in the SON and PVN. In contrast, the number of
FosB-positive cells was significantly increased at 6, and 8 h in both the SON and
PVN. In a second experiment, the effect of water availability on FosB staining 8 
h after injections of 6% NaCl was tested in 3 groups of rats: water ad libitum,
rats that had no access to water, and rats that were given water 2 h prior to
perfusion. FosB staining was significantly reduced in both the SON and the PVN of
rats that had ad libitum water compared to the two water-restricted groups. In
the third experiment, rats were injected with either 0.9% NaCl or 6% NaCl and
were either given ad libitum access to water or water restricted for 6 h after
the injections and perfused 24 h after the saline injections. FosB staining was
not increased when water was available ad libitum. FosB staining was
significantly increased at 24 h in the rats injected with 6% NaCl when water was 
restricted. Thus, FosB may continue to influence protein expression in the SON
and PVN for at least 24 h following acute osmotic stimulation.

Cyclic AMP response element-binding protein is required for normal maternal
nurturing behavior.

Analysis of mice with targeted disruptions of fosB or the gene encoding dopamine 
beta-hydroxylase suggests that FosB and adrenergic signaling play critical roles 
in maternal nurturing behavior. The majority of neonates born to null females
from either mutation fail to thrive, and virgin mutant females of both lines
exhibit impaired pup retrieval. Considering whether FosB and adrenergic signaling
might share a signaling pathway important for maternal behavior, we examined the 
role of a potential intermediary, cyclic AMP response element-binding protein
(CREB). Here we report that approximately 40% of neonates (all heterozygous) born
to mice lacking the major isoforms of CREB (Creb-alphaDelta-/-) died within
several days of birth. In contrast, heterozygotes born to Creb-alphaDelta+/-
females thrived. Cross-fostering demonstrated that neonates born to
Creb-alphaDelta(-/dagger/-) females thrived when reared by wild-type females, and
that Creb-alphaDelta-/- females were capable of rearing neonates whose maternal
care was initiated by wild-type females. Further, virgin Creb-alphaDelta-/-
females were deficient in pup retrieval despite exhibiting normal investigation
of pups and of novel objects. No maternal behavior phenotype was present in mice 
with a null mutation of the cyclic AMP response element modulator (Crem) gene.
Interestingly, the number of cells immunostaining for phospho-CREB (on Ser(133)) 
in the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus, a key region for the expression 
of maternal behavior, increased nearly three-fold in wild-type mice following
exposure to pups but not to novel objects. On the other hand, basal expression
and induction of FosB in response to pup exposure appeared to be independent of
CREB because levels were equivalent between wild-type and Creb-alphaDelta-/-
females. These results implicate CREB in maternal nurturing behavior and suggest 
that CREB is not critical for expression or induction of FosB in adult virgin
female mice.

Normal hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis function in a rat model of peripheral
neuropathic pain.

Chronic pain conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia are
associated with profound hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction
which may exacerbate symptoms of chronic pain. HPA axis dysfunction has also been
well documented in animal models of chronic inflammatory pain. However, the role 
of the HPA axis in animal models of neuropathic pain is currently unknown. Rats
with a chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve that developed
marked mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia of the injured hindpaw were used to 
determine basal and stimulatory levels of HPA axis activity. Plasma ACTH and
corticosterone levels were increased significantly (P < 0.05) in CCI rats after
20 min restraint stress compared with baseline; however, the magnitude of the
increase was no different from sham rats. Furthermore, the temporal profile of
ACTH release over the 60 min period after termination of restraint was similar
between CCI and sham rats suggesting normal glucocorticoid-mediated feedback.
Restraint stress also significantly increased (P < 0.05) expression of the
immediate early genes c-Fos and FosB within the hypothalamic PVN to a similar
extent in CCI and sham rats. Within the parvocellular PVN basal expression of
both CRF and AVP mRNA was no different between CCI and sham rats; restraint
stress induced a significant 2.5 fold increase (P < 0.05) in CRF mRNA expression 
in sham rats only. These results suggest that, in contrast to inflammatory
immune-mediated pain models where HPA axis function is profoundly altered, in the
CCI model of neuropathic pain, basal HPA axis function is unchanged. Furthermore,
the HPA axis responds normally to a novel stressor in the face of ongoing
nociceptive input, a stimulus known to activate the HPA axis.

Methylphenidate regulates c-fos and fosB expression in multiple regions of the
immature rat brain.

Scotia, Canada B3K 6R8.

Methylphenidate (Ritalin, MPH) is a common psychostimulant used to treat
childhood attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Little is known about 
the long-term developmental effects on gene expression and behavior, which may
occur with extended MPH use. We reported previously that the striatum is a major 
target of MPH, consistent with human MRI studies. In the present study, we tested
the hypothesis that MPH is likely to have widespread effects in extra-striatal
regions of the brain. We used the expression of two immediate early genes, c-fos 
and fosB, as probes to map the response of the immature rat brain to single (1
day) versus repeated (14 days) MPH treatment (2 or 10 mg/kg; s.c.) from postnatal
day 25 to 38. Consistent with previous reports, the striatum is a major target of
acute MPH action, as indicated by elevated levels of cFOS-immunoreactivity (-ir).
Increases in c-fos expression were also seen in the nucleus accumbens,
cingulate/frontal cortex and piriform cortex, and Islands of Calleja. FosB
expression was elevated only in the striatum following a single stimulation.
Chronic MPH treatment (10 mg/kg/day for 14 days) resulted in an attenuation of
c-fos expression in the striatum and Islands of Calleja. However, levels of
cFOS-ir remained elevated in the nucleus accumbens and frontal cortex. In
contrast to the inhibitory effect of repeated MPH exposure on c-fos expression,
FOSB-ir was further elevated in the striatum, and an increase was observed in the
cingulate/frontal and piriform cortices. Thus, chronic MPH differentially
regulated expression of c-fos and fosB in several brain regions. Our data suggest
that MPH may exert its stimulant effects at multiple sites in the immature brain,
which has implications for long-term treatment in children.

Transient forebrain ischemia causes selective induction of DeltaFosB, an AP-1
(activator protein-1) subunit, in cells within the ventricle wall or those in the
dentate gyrus in the rat brain prior to neurogenesis, followed by induction of
nestin, a marker for neuronal precursor cells, or galectin-1, a beta-galactoside 
sugar-binding lectin. The adenovirus-mediated expression of FosB or DeltaFosB
induced expression of nestin, glial fibrillary acidic protein and galectin-1 in
rat embryonic cortical cells. DeltaFosB-expressing cells exhibited a
significantly higher survival and proliferation after the withdrawal of B27
supplement than the control or FosB-expressing cells. The decline in the
DeltaFosB expression in the survivors enhanced the MAP2 expression. The
expression of DeltaFosB in cells within the ventricle wall of the rat brain also 
resulted in an elevated expression of nestin. We therefore conclude that
DeltaFosB can promote the proliferation of quiescent neuronal precursor cells,
thus enhancing neurogenesis after transient forebrain ischemia.

Extracellular acidification enhances DNA binding activity of MafG-FosB
heterodimer.

Cells are quite sensitive to a change of the extracellular pH and respond to it
through detection of the H+/HCO3- level in extracellular fluid. However, little
is known about molecular details induced by acidosis, such as intracellular
pathways and gene expression. Here we describe properties of gene expression,
protein interaction, and DNA binding activity of basic region leucine zipper
(bZIP) transcription factor Maf and FosB during extracellular acidification. When
cells were incubated with low pH medium, the expressions of small Maf proteins
(MafG, MafK, and MafF) and FosB were clearly increased in an extracellular
pH-dependent manner and expressed transiently with a peak after 1-2 h after
stimulation. Immunofluorescence and protein binding studies indicated that MafG
was partially co-localized with FosB in the nucleus and MafG can form
heterodimers with FosB at extracellular pH 7.40. Moreover, we found that
MafG-FosB complexes are able to bind to AP-1 consensus sequence, TGACTCA. To
investigate whether extracellular acidification influences to dimerization and
DNA binding activity of MafG and FosB, extracellular pH of cultured cells was
decreased from 7.40 to 6.80. The decrease in extracellular pH led to enhanced
dimerization of MafG with FosB leading to augmentation of the DNA binding
activity of the heterodimer to AP-1 consensus sequence. Moreover, extracellular
acidification induces mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1, one of the
genes that are regulated by AP-1. These results suggest that MafG-FosB complexes 
are involved in transcriptional regulation in response to extracellular
acidification.

Broad St., Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA. dlance1@aol.com

Induction of the transcription factor deltaFosB was studied to examine
neurochemical adaptations produced by repeated opiate administration. The
mechanism of this induction was also investigated. The 35- to 37-kDa isoforms of 
deltaFosB, also referred to as the chronic Fras, were measured in the nucleus
accumbens, caudate putamen, and frontal cortex of male Sprague-Dawley rats after 
either an acute injection of morphine or an escalating dosing schedule of
morphine for 10 days. Heroin was also tested to determine whether the findings
extend to other opiates. Results from Western blot analysis using an anti-fosB
antibody demonstrate that 10-day intermittent escalating dose morphine produced a
significant increase in deltaFosB-immunoreactivity in the nucleus accumbens,
caudate putamen and frontal cortex, whereas a single injection of morphine had no
effect on Fra immunoreactivity. Heroin administered twice daily for 10 days by an
intermittent escalating dose schedule also induced deltaFosB in the caudate
putamen, but not in the nucleus accumbens or frontal cortex. Daily pretreatment
with the selective D1-like dopamine receptor antagonist SCH 23390
[R-(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine
hydrochloride] significantly blocked morphine-induced deltaFosB induction in the 
nucleus accumbens and caudate putamen, but not in the frontal cortex. These
results demonstrate that morphine-induced deltaFosB up-regulation in the
striatum, but not in the frontal cortex, is modulated by D1 dopamine receptors,
suggesting that the mechanisms involved in the up-regulation of these chronic
Fras by morphine is brain region-specific.

Functional analysis of active site residues of the fosfomycin resistance enzyme
FosA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Beharry Z(1), Palzkill T.

Houston, Texas 77030, USA.

The metalloglutathione transferase FosA catalyzes the conjugation of glutathione 
to carbon-1 of the antibiotic fosfomycin, rendering it ineffective as an
antibacterial drug. Codon randomization and selection for the ability of
resulting clones to confer fosfomycin resistance to Escherichia coli were used to
identify residues critical for FosA function. Of the 24 codons chosen for
randomization, 16 were found to be essential because only the wild type amino
acid was selected. These included ligands to the Mn(2+) and the K(+), residues
that furnish hydrogen bonds to fosfomycin, and residues located in a putative
glutathione/fosfomycin-binding site. The remaining eight positions randomized
were tolerant to substitutions. Site-directed mutagenesis of some of the
essential and tolerant amino acids to alanine was performed, and the activity of 
the purified proteins was determined. Mutation of the residues that are within
hydrogen bonding distance to the oxirane or phosphonate oxygens of fosfomycin
resulted in variants with very low or no activity. Mutation of Ser(94), which
bridges one of the phosphonate oxygens with a potassium ion, resulted in
insoluble protein. The Y39A mutation in the putative glutathione-binding site
resulted in a 4-fold increase in the apparent K(m) for glutathione. Only two of
the amino acids in the substrate-binding site are conserved in the related
fosfomycin resistance proteins FosB and FosX, whereas no amino acids in the
putative glutathione-binding site are conserved.

Activator protein 1 (AP-1) proteins play key roles in the regulation of cell
proliferation and differentiation. In this study we investigated the expression
of Fos and Jun proteins in different models of terminal differentiation of human 
keratinocytes and in skin from psoriasis patients. All Jun and Fos proteins, with
the exception of FosB, were efficiently expressed in keratinocytes in monolayer
cultures. In contrast, in normal epidermis as well as in organotypic epidermal
cultures, the expression pattern of AP-1 proteins was dependent on the
differentiation stage. Fos proteins were readily detected in nuclei of
keratinocytes of basal and suprabasal layers. JunB and JunD were expressed in all
layers of normal epidermis. Interestingly, expression of c-Jun started
suprabasally, then disappeared and became detectable again in distinct cells of
the outermost granular layer directly at the transition zone to the stratum
corneum. In psoriatic epidermis, c-Jun expression was prominent in both
hyperproliferating basal and suprabasal keratinocytes, whereas c-Fos expression
was unchanged. These data indicate that AP-1 proteins are expressed in a highly
specific manner during terminal differentiation of keratinocytes and that the
enhanced expression of c-Jun in basal and suprabasal keratinocytes might
contribute to the pathogenesis of psoriasis.

DeltaFosB is a truncated form of a FosB transcription factor, which is created by
alternative splicing. Previous work has shown that transgenic mice expressing
DeltaFosB both in the retina and in the lens developed a posterior subcapsular
cataract resulting from the misalignment of the fibres in the suture region. In
the previous study, it was not clear whether DeltaFosB expression was required in
both tissues to produce the cataract. Therefore, DeltaFosB expression targeted to
either the lens or the retina was undertaken in order to clarify the contribution
of each tissue to cataract development. For lens expression, the
R2betaB1DeltaFosB construct was synthesized (R2, an enhancer; betaB1, a chicken
betaB1 crystallin gene promoter fragment). For the retina, RhoDeltaFosB was
prepared. As a promoter, the bovine rhodopsin upstream region was used. DeltaFosB
expression in heterozygote animals was monitored by Western blotting. Cataract
development in heterozygotes of R2betaB1DeltaFosB transgenics and in both
heterozygotes and homozygotes of RhoDeltaFosB transgenics was followed by
slitlamp examination. The transgenic mice prepared with RhoDeltaFosB expressed
DeltaFosB only in the retina and showed no sign of lens opacity. One line of the 
R2betaB1DeltaFosB transgenic was found to have expression only in the lens and
developed posterior subcapsular cataract. We concluded that retinal expression of
DeltaFosB is not sufficient to cause cataract while expression exclusively in the
lens produces posterior subcapsular cataract.

DeltaFosB is a unique transcription factor that plays an essential role in
long-term adaptive changes in the brain associated with diverse conditions, such 
as drug addiction, Parkinson's disease, depression, and antidepressant treatment.
It is induced in brain, in a region- and cell-type-specific manner by many types 
of chronic perturbations. Once induced, it persists for long periods of time due 
to its unusual stability. The transcriptional effects of DeltaFosB are complex,
because the protein can function as both a transcriptional activator and
repressor. Progress has been made in identifying specific target genes for
DeltaFosB and in relating some of these genes to DeltaFosB's cellular and
behavioral actions. Future studies will help us to better understand the
biochemical basis of DeltaFosB's unique stability, as well as the precise
molecular pathways through which this transcription factor produces its complex
effects on neuronal plasticity and complex behavior.

Acute and chronic stress differentially regulate immediate-early gene (IEG)
expression in the brain. Although acute stress induces c-Fos and FosB, repeated
exposure to stress desensitizes the c-Fos response, but FosB-like
immunoreactivity remains high. Several other treatments differentially regulate
IEG expression in a similar manner after acute versus chronic exposure. The form 
of FosB that persists after these chronic treatments has been identified as
DeltaFosB, a splice variant of the fosB gene. This study was designed to
determine whether the FosB form induced after chronic stress is also DeltaFosB
and to map the brain regions and identify the cell populations that exhibit this 
effect. Western blotting, using an antibody that recognizes all Fos family
members, revealed that acute restraint stress caused robust induction of c-Fos
and full-length FosB, as well as a small induction of DeltaFosB, in the frontal
cortex (fCTX) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). The induction of c-Fos (and to some
extent full-length FosB) was desensitized after 10 d of restraint stress, at
which point levels of DeltaFosB were high. A similar pattern was observed after
chronic unpredictable stress. By use of immunohistochemistry, we found that
chronic restraint stress induced DeltaFosB expression predominantly in the fCTX, 
NAc, and basolateral amygdala, with lower levels of induction seen elsewhere.
These findings establish that chronic stress induces DeltaFosB in several
discrete regions of the brain. Such induction could contribute to the long-term
effects of stress on the brain.

Transcriptional regulation of Zic3 by heterodimeric AP-1(c-Jun/c-Fos) during
Xenopus development.

The heterodimeric c-Jun/c-Fos, an activator protein-1 (AP-1) has been implicated 
in mesoderm induction (Dong et al., 1996; Kim et al., 1998) whereas the homodimer
of c-Jun was reported to be involved in neural inhibition during the early
development of Xenopus embryos. During the early vertebrate development AP-1
involvement in the neural induction is still not clearly understood. We report
here that AP-1 has a role in Zic3 expression, a critical proneural gene and a
primary regulator of neural and neural crest development (Nakata et al., 1997;
Nakata et al., 1998). AP-1 was able to induce the Zic3 gene in a dose dependent
manner but other homo- or hetero-dimeric proteins, such as c-Jun/c-Jun, JunD/FosB
or JunD/Fra-1 were not. The inhibition of AP-1 activity using morpholino
antisenses of c-jun mRNAs blocked the Zic3 expression induced by activin. In
addition, co-injection of c-jun mRNA rescued the down-regulated Zic3 expression. 
The promoter region of isolated Zic3 genomic DNA was found to possess several
consensus-binding site of AP-1. Thus, in the functional assays, AP-1 could
increase promoter activity of Zic3 gene. These findings suggest that proneural
gene, Zic3 may be regulated by heterodimeric AP-1(c-Jun/c-Fos) and it may have a 
role in activin signaling for the regulation of neural specific gene, Zic3.

Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been shown to be involved 
in the maintenance of striatal dopaminergic neurons. To study whether reduced
levels of endogenous GDNF affect the striatal dopaminergic transmission we
estimated the basal extracellular levels of dopamine in vivo, the basal
expression of FosB-related proteins in striatal brain areas as well as the
effects of acute and repeated cocaine on locomotor activity and dopamine output
in mice lacking one GDNF allele (heterozygous GDNF+/- mice). As expected the
striatal GDNF protein content was found to be smaller in the GDNF+/- mice than in
their wild-type littermates. Unexpectedly the extracellular dopamine
concentration in the GDNF+/- mice in the dorsal striatum (CPu) was 2.0-fold, and 
in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) 1.6-fold the concentration found in the wild-type 
littermates. Also FosB/DeltaFosB-like immunoreactivity was found to be elevated
in the CPu as well as in the core and in the shell of NAc of the GDNF+/- mice as 
compared with the wild-type mice. This suggests chronic postsynaptic activation
of these brain areas and is in line with elevated extracellular dopamine
concentrations. Cocaine's effects acutely and after repeated treatment on
locomotor activity were similar in the GDNF+/- and the wild-type mice. Neither
did cocaine's acute effects on dopamine output differ between the mice of the two
strains. Our findings demonstrate that reduced levels of endogenous GDNF induce
alterations in dorsal striatal and accumbal dopaminergic transmission, and stress
the importance of endogenous GDNF in the regulation of the dopaminergic neurons.

The activin type II receptor (ACVR2) gene is a putative tumor suppressor gene
that is frequently mutated in microsatellite-unstable colon cancers (MSI-H colon 
cancers). ACVR2 is a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta type II 
receptor (TGFBR2) family and controls cell growth and differentiation. SMAD
proteins are major intracellular effectors shared by ACVR2 and TGFBR2 signaling; 
however, additional shared effector mechanisms remain to be explored. To discover
novel mechanisms transmitting the ACVR2 signal, we restored ACVR2 function by
transfecting wild-type ACVR2 (wt-ACVR2) into a MSI-H colon cancer cell line
carrying an ACVR2 frameshift mutation. The effect of ACVR2 restoration on cell
growth, SMAD phosphorylation, and global molecular phenotype was then evaluated. 
Decreased cell growth was observed in wt-ACVR2 transfectants relative to
ACVR2-deficient vector-transfected controls. Western blotting revealed higher
expression of phosphorylated SMAD2 in wt-ACVR2 transfectants versus controls,
suggesting cells deficient in ACVR2 had impaired SMAD signaling. Microarray-based
differential expression analysis revealed substantial ACVR2-induced
overexpression of genes implicated in the control of cell growth and
tumorigenesis, including the activator protein (AP)-1 complex genes JUND, JUN,
and FOSB, as well as the small GTPase signal transduction family members, RHOB,
ARHE, and ARHGDIA. Overexpression of these genes is shared with TGFBR2
activation. This observed similarity between the activin and TGF-beta signaling
systems suggests that activin may serve as an alternative activator of TGF-beta
effectors, including SMADs, and that frameshift mutation of ACVR2 may contribute 
to MSI-H colon tumorigenesis via disruption of alternate TGF-beta effector
pathways.

Constitutive activation of transcription factor AP-1 in cervical cancer and
suppression of human papillomavirus (HPV) transcription and AP-1 activity in HeLa
cells by curcumin.

Delhi, India.

The transcription factor AP-1 plays a central role in the transcriptional
regulation of specific types of high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) such as
HPV16 and HPV18, which are etiologically associated with the development of
cancer of the uterine cervix in women. In our study, we investigated the AP-1
binding activity and the expression pattern of different members of the AP-1
transcription factor family (c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1 and Fra-2) in 
different grades of cervical lesions starting from mild dysplasia to invasive
cervical tumors, including normal control tissues, using specific antibodies
raised against each of the AP-1 members. Results indicate that though AP-1 showed
high binding activity and the majority of its members were highly expressed in
tumor tissues, there is a distinct pattern of gradual increase of c-fos and a
concomitant decrease of fra-1 expression that perfectly match the progression of 
cervical lesions. While c-fos is highly expressed in invasive cervical tumor, the
expression of fra-1 becomes almost nil or absent, but the reverse is true in both
controls and early precancerous lesions. These findings corroborate the results
obtained in the cervical cancer cell line, HeLa. Interestingly, despite very low 
or absent AP-1 binding in normal as well as in premalignant lesions, AP-1
transcription and its binding activity was found to be very high in malignant
tissues showing a preferential heterodimerization of c-fos with JunB instead of
its canonical dimerization partner c-jun. Both in vivo and in vitro studies
demonstrate that the overexpression of c-fos and downregulation of fra-1
expression as well as a change in the dimerization pattern of the AP-1 complex
seem to play a crucial role during progression to malignancy. In a previous
study, we demonstrated that a synthetic antioxidant, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate 
(PDTC) can selectively downregulate HPV expression in human keratinocytes and
cervical cancer cell lines. Since a redox regulatory pathway is involved in the
expression of HPV that can be modulated by an antioxidant-induced reconstitution 
of the AP-1 transcription complex, we have used curcumin (diferuloylmethane), an 
active component of the perennial herb turmeric, which is a potent antioxidant
and is well-known for its antiinflammatory and anticarcinogenic activity, to
modulate the transcription of AP-1 and HPV. We demonstrate for the first time
that curcumin can selectively downregulate HPV18 transcription as well as the
AP-1 binding activity in HeLa cells. Most interestingly, curcumin can reverse the
expression dynamics of c-fos and fra-1 in this tumorigenic cell line, mimicking
the expression pattern observed in normal controls or precancerous lesions.
Observation of curcumin-mediated complete downregulation of AP-1 binding activity
and reversal of c-fos/fra-1 transcription to a normal state in tumorigenic HeLa
cells represents a novel mechanism that can control transcription of pathogenic
HPVs during keratinocyte differentiation and progression of cervical cancer. Our 
study thus provides a basis for developing a novel therapeutic approach to
control pathogenic HPV infection by using potent antioxidative agents, such as
curcumin.

    Circulation. 2005 May 24;111(20):e309; author reply e309.

BACKGROUND: During systemic inflammation, activation of vascular endothelium by
proinflammatory cytokines leads to hypotension, microvascular thrombosis, and
organ damage. Recent data suggest a link between coagulation and inflammation
through the activated protein C (APC) pathway. We studied gene expression
profiles in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) exposed to
proinflammatory stimuli and the influence of APC on expression of candidate genes
regulated by these stimuli.
METHODS AND RESULTS: HCAECs were stimulated with interleukin-1beta,
interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. In gene expression profiling, 
400 of 8400 genes were regulated >2-fold. Verification of selected candidate
genes was achieved by measuring expression of mRNA species by real-time
polymerase chain reaction, cytokine secretion by ELISA, and metabolites of
tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) biosynthesis by high-performance liquid chromatography.
BH4 synthesis, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1
(MCP-1), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were downregulated by APC
at the transcriptional and protein level. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase,
endothelial adhesion molecule, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 were not
affected by APC. Activities of transcription factors c-Fos, FosB, and c-Rel were 
inhibited by APC in inflamed HCAECs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed a novel antiinflammatory mechanism of
APC-dependent gene regulation in HCAECs since c-Fos-dependent induction of MCP-1 
and ICAM-1 was suppressed. APC downregulates expression and activity of genes
related to inflammation, most pronounced under intermediate or mild inflammatory 
conditions.

PURPOSE: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare but particularly aggressive
form of primary breast cancer. The molecular mechanisms responsible for IBC are
largely unknown.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To obtain further insight into the molecular pathogenesis of
IBC, we used real-time quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to quantify
the mRNA expression of 538 selected genes in IBC relative to non-IBC.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven (5.0%) of the 538 genes were significantly up-regulated in 
IBC compared with non-IBC. None were down-regulated. The 27 up-regulated genes
mainly encoded transcription factors (JUN, EGR1, JUNB, FOS, FOSB, MYCN, and
SNAIL1), growth factors (VEGF, DTR/HB-EGF, IGFBP7, IL6, ANGPT2, EREG, CCL3/MIP1A,
and CCL5/RANTES) and growth factor receptors (TBXA2R, TNFRSF10A/TRAILR1, and
ROBO2). We also identified a gene expression profile, based on MYCN, EREG, and
SHH, which discriminated subgroups of IBC patients with good, intermediate, and
poor outcome.
CONCLUSION: Our study has identified a limited number of signaling pathways that 
require inappropriate activation for IBC development. Some of the up-regulated
genes identified here could offer useful diagnostic or prognostic markers and
could form the basis of novel therapeutic strategies.

A highly conserved enhancer in mammalian type X collagen genes drives high levels
of tissue-specific expression in hypertrophic cartilage in vitro and in vivo.

Medicine, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Glueckstr.6, D-91054, Germany.

Previously we have identified a cis-acting regulatory domain in the human type X 
collagen gene upstream of the transcription start site which acts as a strong
enhancer in hypertrophic, but not in resting chondrocytes. Here we show that this
enhancer is highly conserved also in the murine and bovine Col10a1 genes, but not
found in the known promoter sequences of chicken Col10a1. It contains a
functionally active AP-1 site (TPA Responsive Element, TRE) which is essential
for the high transcriptional activity of the COL10A1 enhancer in transiently
transfected hypertrophic chondrocytes. Gel-shift experiments with nuclear
extracts of hypertrophic chondrocytes revealed FosB and Fra-1 as candidates
regulating AP-1 factors binding to the TRE site. In fact, coexpression of FosB
and Fra-1 in reporter gene assays greatly stimulated transcriptional activity of 
enhancer bearing reporter genes. Quantitative analysis of AP-1 factor mRNA levels
in distinct fractions of fetal bovine epiphyseal chondrocytes by real-time PCR
confirmed significant levels of FosB and Fra-1 mRNA besides other AP-1 factors in
hypertrophic chondrocytes. A key role of the enhancer element in regulating
tissue-specific expression of the Col10a1 gene was shown by establishing
transgenic mouse lines with a reporter gene containing a 4.6 kb murine Col10a1
promoter fragment which included the enhancer, exon 1, part of exon 2 and the
first intron. Reporter gene expression was seen exclusively in hypertrophic
cartilages in the growth plates of long bones, ribs, vertebrae, sternum and
mandibles of 17.5-18.5 dpc embryos, confirming that the 4.6 kb promoter is able
to drive specific expression of Col10a1 in hypertrophic cartilage. These
established transgenic lines should facilitate the genetic analysis of regulatory
pathways of chondrocyte maturation and Col10a1 gene expression in the future.

Effects of water deprivation and rehydration on c-Fos and FosB staining in the
rat supraoptic nucleus and lamina terminalis region.

Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, 7703 Floyd Curl Dr., San Antonio, TX

We studied cFos and FosB staining in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) the organum
vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) and the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO)
in adult male rats after water deprivation (24 h, n = 11; 48 h, n = 12) and water
deprivation with rehydration (22 h + water, n = 11; 46 h + water, n = 10).
Control rats (n = 15) had water available ad libitum. Separate sets of serial
sections from each brain were processed for immunocytochemistry using primary
antibodies against either c-Fos or FosB protein. Plasma osmolality, vasopressin, 
hematocrit, and plasma proteins were measured in separate groups (n = 6-7). The
number of c-Fos-positive cells in the SON was significantly increased after 24
and 48 h of water deprivation. In contrast, rehydrated groups were not different 
from control. Water deprivation significantly increased c-Fos staining in both
the OVLT and the MnPO, but c-Fos staining was not altered by rehydration. FosB
staining in the SON was significantly increased only by 48-h water deprivation,
and this effect was significantly decreased by rehydration. In the MnPO and OVLT,
FosB staining was significantly increased by water deprivation, and, like c-Fos
staining, these increases were not affected by rehydration. Water deprivation
significantly increased osmolality and hematocrit, as well as plasma protein and 
vasopressin concentrations. Plasma measurements from rehydrated rats were not
different from control. We conclude that water deprivation and rehydration
differentially affect c-Fos and FosB staining in a region-dependent manner.

Mechanical stress to bone plays a critical role in maintaining bone mass and
strength. However, the molecular mechanism of mechanical stress-induced bone
formation is not fully understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that FosB
and its spliced variant DeltaFosB, which is known to increase bone mass by
stimulating bone formation in vivo, is rapidly induced by mechanical loading in
mouse hind limb bone in vivo and by fluid shear stress (FSS) in mouse calvarial
osteoblasts in vitro both at the mRNA and protein levels. FSS induction of
FosB/DeltaFosB gene expression was dependent on gadlinium-sensitive Ca(2+) influx
and subsequent activation of ERK1/2. Analysis of the mouse FosB/DeltaFosB gene
upstream regulatory region with luciferase reporter gene assays revealed that the
FosB/DeltaFosB induction by FSS occurred at the transcriptional level and was
conferred by a short fragment from -603 to -327. DNA precipitation assays and DNA
decoy experiments indicated that ERK-dependent activation of CREB binding to a
CRE/AP-1 like element (designated "CRE2") at the position of -413 largely
contributed to the transcriptional effects of FSS. These results suggest that
DeltaFosB participates in mechanical stress-induced intracellular signaling
cascades that activate the osteogenic program in osteoblasts.

Members of the Fos family of AP-1 transcription factors (c-Fos, FosB, FosB2,
Fra-1 and Fra-2) are able to form dimers with Jun proteins which bind to the
regulatory sequences of target genes. As many proteases involved in tumor
invasion are AP-1-regulated, we assumed that Fos family members might be
important for invasion of mammary carcinomas. Therefore, we performed transient
transfections with expression vectors for c-Fos, FosB, FosB2, Fra-1 and Fra-2,
followed by matrigel invasion assays. Fra-1 transfection resulted in a 2-4-fold
increase of invasive cells in both cell lines. In a less degree, the invasive
potential of MDA-MB231 cells was stimulated by Fra-2, whereas MCF7 invasion was
enhanced by c-Fos and FosB. By double-labelling immunocytochemistry, PAI-1
up-regulation was observed in cells transfected with c-Fos, Fra-1 and Fra-2
expression vectors, whereas MMP1 and MMP9 expression was not affected. Results of
cotransfection with a MMP9 promoter construct and AP-1 expression vectors do not 
indicate a direct up-regulation of MMP9 expression by Fos proteins except a
positive effect of c-Fos in MCF7 cells. In parallel, expression of Fos family
members as determined by Western Blot analysis in 75 mammary carcinomas was
correlated with MMP1, MMP9, PAI-1 and uPAR protein levels in the tumors.
Interestingly, high FosB levels were significantly associated with MMP1
overexpression, whereas expression of c-Fos and phosphorylated Fra-1 correlated
with MMP9 protein levels. Strong Fra-2 expression correlated with high levels of 
MMP9, PAI-1, the uPA/PAI-1 complex and early recurrence. These data indicate that
Fos proteins, especially Fra-1, c-Fos and Fra-2, might be involved in invasion of
breast cancer cells.

Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription
factors regulate many important biological and pathological processes. Activation
of NF-kappaB is regulated by the inducible phosphorylation of NF-kappaB inhibitor
IkappaB by IkappaB kinase. In contrast, Fos, a key component of AP-1, is
primarily transcriptionally regulated by serum responsive factors (SRFs) and
ternary complex factors (TCFs). Despite these different regulatory mechanisms,
there is an intriguing possibility that NF-kappaB and AP-1 may modulate each
other, thus expanding the scope of these two rapidly inducible transcription
factors. To determine whether NF-kappaB activity is involved in the regulation of
fos expression in response to various stimuli, we analyzed activity of AP-1 and
expression of fos, fosB, fra-1, fra-2, jun, junB, and junD, as well as AP-1
downstream target gene VEGF, using MDAPanc-28 and MDAPanc-28/IkappaBalphaM
pancreatic tumor cells and wild-type, IKK1-/-, and IKK2-/- murine embryonic
fibroblast cells. Our results show that elk-1, a member of TCFs, is one of the
NF-kappaB downstream target genes. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity greatly
decreased expression of elk-1. Consequently, the reduced level of activated Elk-1
protein by extracellular signal-regulated kinase impeded constitutive, serum-,
and superoxide-inducible c-fos expression. Thus, our study revealed a distinct
and essential role of NF-kappaB in participating in the regulation of elk-1,
c-fos, and VEGF expression.

Drug dependence is characterized by symptoms causing uncontrollable use of a drug
despite its negative consequences. Dependence occurs only in a small fraction of 
individuals who try an addictive drug, and there is a large variance in
individual susceptibility to dependence. Individuals susceptible to dependence
exhibit specific comorbid behavioral traits, such as sensation seeking, novelty
seeking, and antisocial personality. Studies using genetically engineered mice
have delineated the extent to which various genes contribute to both dependence
susceptibility and comorbid behavioral traits. Evidence suggests that the genes
for dopamine D4 receptor, phosphodiesterease1B, the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1, 
5HT1B receptor, protein kinase C and the transcription factor FosB contribute to 
both dependence susceptibility and comorbid behavioral traits. However, MAO-B
influences a behavioral response to novelty without affecting nicotine dependence
susceptibility. The mechanisms by which genes influence dependence susceptibility
and comorbid behavioral traits are likely to be complex.

The Fos family of transcription factors may play a key role in various forms of
brain plasticity. Among different genes coding Fos proteins is the fosB gene.
Protein products of the fosB gene are thought to be critically involved in neural
adaptations produced by chronic treatment with drugs of abuse. fosB gene
transcription leads to accumulation of full-length FosB as well as its truncated 
form, deltafosB. Stable isoforms of deltafosB called chronic FRAs accumulate in
the brain after chronic administration of various drugs of abuse. The purpose of 
the present study was to evaluate the role of the fosB gene in two-bottle choice 
ethanol self-administration. For this aim, ethanol (2-8% v/v) intake and
preference was assessed in fosB mutant (n=17) and wild-type (WT) mice (n=16). For
comparison, consumption of saccharin (0.05-0.8% w/v) and quinine (15-960 microM) 
solutions was assessed in the same animals. Ethanol preference in both groups
varied from around 50% for the lowest to 20% for the highest ethanol
concentration. Neither ethanol intake (g/kg) nor preference differed between the 
two genotypes. In contrast, saccharin preference, but not intake, was higher in
the fosB mutants. Only slight and inconsistent between-group differences were
observed in terms of quinine preference. The present results suggest that
permanent elimination of fosB gene products does not alter ethanol intake but may
enhance preference for sweet solutions in mice.

Pyroglutamyl-histidyl-glycine, the endogenous colon mitosis inhibitor, regulates 
cyclic AMP level in non-tumorigenic colonic epithelial cells.

NO-0027 Oslo, Norway. w.h.reichelt@klinmed.uio.no

BACKGROUND: We have proposed that the mitosis inhibiting peptide, pyroGlu-His-Gly
(pEHG), a colon-specific negative feedback regulator of cell proliferation, works
through a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), as do many other
pyroglutamyl-peptides.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-tumorigenic YAMC (colon mucosa of Immorto mice), IMCE 
(Immorto-Min mouse hybrid) and human hepatoma (HepG2) cell lines were exposed to 
pEHG. cAMP concentrations were measured with a protein binding assay, mRNA levels
with real-time PCR and Ca2+ concentration with an inverted fluorescence
microscope on Fura-2/AM-loaded cells.
RESULTS: pEHG (1 nM) increased the intracellular concentration of cAMP after 5-10
min in YAMC cells, but not in HepG2 cells. No effect was seen on cytosolic Ca2+, 
or in the expression of the proliferation and differentiation regulatory genes
c-fos, egr-1 or fosB in YAMC or IMCE cells.
CONCLUSION: pEHG stimulates the second messenger cAMP, but has no effect on
intracellular Ca2+ or the gene expression of c-fos, egr-1 or fosB.

Circadian dependency of nocturnal immediate-early protein induction in rat
retina.

Humphries A(1), Carter DA.

Author information: 
(1)School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.

Daily rhythms in the mammalian retina are regulated by an endogenous circadian
clock. Previously it was found that neuronal elements of the rat retina respond
to light:dark (L:D) transitions with cell-specific changes in expression of the
c-fos gene. Using a pan-Fos antibody to probe Western blots of rat retina, we
have now shown that darkness is associated with a 60-fold increase in c-Fos
protein, whereas levels of FosB and Fos-related antigens are invariant. The
induction of c-Fos exhibits circadian dependency; accumulation of c-Fos protein
was significantly enhanced, by a factor of 2.5-fold, when darkness onset was
coincident with the established L:D transition. c-Fos exhibited only a low
amplitude circadian rhythm in the absence of L:D cycles. Similar results were
obtained for another immediate early gene (IEG) protein, Egr-1. These findings
show that IEG induction in the rodent retina exhibits circadian clock dependency.

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) was used to examine changes in FosB
mRNA expression in models of oxygen and light stress to the retina. C57BL/6 mice 
or Sprague-Dawley (SD) albino rats were subjected to several experimental
paradigms: short-term light or oxygen stress, extended hyperoxia (75% oxygen), or
a model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). Control animals were subjected to
room air and 5 lux cyclic light. FosB expression dramatically increases in
response to light stress as well as in a model of OIR, but not in response to
sustained 75% oxygen. These data suggest that both hypoxia and light stress
induce expression of FosB in the retina.

BACKGROUND: The colon mitosis inhibiting peptide pyroglutamyl-histidyl-glycine
(pEHG) increases the expression of c-fos, fosB and egr-1 genes in the colon
carcinoma cell line HT-29. However, the effect on non-tumorigenic colonic cells
has not been investigated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: After exposure of the cell lines YAMC (from colon mucosa
of Immorto mice) and IMCE (fromn Immorto-Min mouse hybrid) to pEHG, DNA-synthesis
was analysed by H3-thymidine incorporation, apoptosis and necrosis by
fluorescence microscopy, and cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: pEHG inhibited DNA-synthesis with a maximal effect at 10(-8)-10(-9) M,
but stimulated at 10(-4) M. It blocked cell flow through the cell cycle at GC/M
after 8 h of treatment, but had no effect on apoptosis or necrosis at any
concentration. A low concentration of ascorbic acid stabilised the cells, maybe
as a free radical scavanger.
CONCLUSION: pEHG inhibits flux at the G2/M transition, but has no effect on cell 
death.

To determine the contribution of IL-1, TNF-alpha and IL-17 on AP-1, NF-kappaB and
Egr-1 activation in cytokine induced bone destruction as observed in rheumatoid
arthritis, we investigated the effect of these pro-inflammatory cytokines used
alone or in combination on transcription factor activation in osteoblast-like ROS
17/2.8 cells. The effects of each cytokine were measured by RT-PCR and
immunocytochemistry. IL-1 and TNF-alpha induced most of these transcription
factors while IL-17 had a weak effect. IL-1 and TNF-alpha induced egr-1 and all
AP-1 member expression, except fosB and junD. These two cytokines used alone
induced their nuclear translocation in 30 min, except for FosB and JunB. IL-17
enhanced fra-2 and egr-1 mRNA expression, while nuclear localization was observed
for Fra-1, JunD and NF-kappaB. More importantly, combination of low
concentrations of these cytokines, with no effect separately, showed a
synergistic effect on transcription and nuclear translocation of AP-1 members,
Egr-1 and NF-kappaB. Moreover, cytokine combinations were associated with an
enhanced recruitment of factors not expressed when cytokines were used alone. In 
conclusion, AP-1, Egr-1 and NF-kappaB pathways in osteoblast cells are very
sensitive to the combined effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines through
synergistic mechanisms.

Mechanical stretch and progesterone differentially regulate activator protein-1
transcription factors in primary rat myometrial smooth muscle cells.

Canada M5G 1X5.

During pregnancy, stretch of the uterus, imposed by the growing fetus, is an
important signal for the induction of genes involved in the onset of labor. In
this study, the expression of activator protein-1 (AP-1) family mRNAs in response
to in vitro stretch was investigated in myometrial cells. Rat primary myometrial 
smooth muscle cells were plated onto collagen I-coated Flex I culture plates and 
subjected to 25% static stretch on day 4 of culture. Static stretch induced an
increase in the expression of c-fos, fosB, fra-1, c-jun, and junB. The expression
of both c-fos and junB was maximally induced at 30 min by static stretch. The
peak induction for fosB and c-jun occurred at 1 h, whereas the peak of fra-1
induction occurred between 1 and 2 h after application of stretch. Treatment of
myometrial cells with progesterone (100 nM, 400 nM, 1 microM) for 1 or 6 h before
the application of static stretch did not affect the magnitude of the c-fos
response. However, 24 h of progesterone exposure reduced the magnitude of c-fos
and fosB stretch induction at both the 400 nM and 1 microM doses. These data
indicate that several members of the AP-1 family are stretch-responsive genes in 
myometrial smooth muscle cells. This response can be attenuated by pretreatment
with progesterone; however, the requirement for longer pretreatment times
suggests that the inhibitory actions of progesterone do not occur through a
direct action of the progesterone receptor within the promoter regions of AP-1
genes.

Transcriptional mechanisms regulating alveolar epithelial cell-specific CCL5
secretion in pulmonary tuberculosis.

Author information:

London W12 0NN, United Kingdom.

CCL5 (or RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and
secreted)) recruits T lymphocytes and monocytes. The source and regulation of
CCL5 in pulmonary tuberculosis are unclear. Infection of the human alveolar
epithelial cell line (A549) by Mycobacterium tuberculosis caused no CCL5
secretion and little monocyte secretion. Conditioned medium from
tuberculosis-infected human monocytes (CoMTB) stimulated significant CCL5
secretion from A549 cells and from primary alveolar, but not upper airway,
epithelial cells. Differential responsiveness of small airway and normal human
bronchial epithelial cells to CoMTB but not to conditioned medium from
unstimulated human monocytes was specific to CCL5 and not to CXCL8. CoMTB induced
CCL5 mRNA accumulation in A549 cells and induced nuclear translocation of nuclear
factor kappaB (NFkappaB) subunits p50, p65, and c-rel at 1 h; nuclear binding of 
activator protein (AP)-1 (c-Fos, FosB, and c-Jun) at 4-8 h; and binding of
NF-interleukin (IL)-6 at 24 h. CCL5 promoter-reporter analysis using deletion and
site-specific mutagenesis constructs demonstrated a key role for AP-1, NF-IL-6,
and NFkappaB in driving CoMTB-induced promoter activity. The IL-1 receptor
antagonist inhibited A549 and small airway epithelial cell CCL5 secretion, gene
expression, and promoter activity. CoMTB contained IL-1beta, and recombinant
IL-1beta reproduced CoMTB effects. Monocyte alveolar, but not upper airway,
epithelial cell networks in pulmonary tuberculosis cause AP-1-, NF-IL-6-, and
NFkappaB-dependent CCL5 secretion. IL-1beta is the critical regulator of
tuberculosis-stimulated CCL5 secretion in the lung.

FosB expression in the central nervous system following isotonic volume expansion
in unanesthetized rats.

Cardiovascular Research Center, University of Missouri-Columbia, USA.

We examined c-Fos and FosB staining in the central nervous system 8 and 24 h
following acute volume expansion in unanesthetized rats. Male rats were
instrumented with a femoral artery catheter for measurement of blood pressure and
heart rate (HR), a jugular venous catheter for measurement of central venous
pressure (CVP), and a femoral vein catheter for i.v. infusion. After 48 h, rats
were volume expanded with isotonic saline (10% of body weight for 10 min i.v.) or
given a control infusion (0.01 ml/min for 10 min i.v.). After a period of 8 or 24
h, the rats were deeply anesthetized and perfused transcardially with 4%
paraformaldehyde. Separate sets of serial sections of the hypothalamus were
processed for either FosB (Santa Cruz) or c-Fos (Oncogene AB-5)
immunocytochemistry. The volume expansion protocol significantly increased
central venous pressure but did not affect blood pressure or heart rate. Volume
expansion produced a significant increase in FosB-positive cells in the
paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, the supraoptic nucleus (SON), 
the perinuclear zone (PNZ) of the supraoptic nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary
tract (NST), and the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVL) in both the 8- and 24-h
groups. In the area postrema (AP), the number of FosB-positive cells was
significantly increased only at 8 h post-infusion. However, c-Fos was not
significantly increased above control levels at either time point. The results
demonstrate that FosB activation is maintained for at least 24 h following an
acute increase in central venous pressure.

Hypoxic suppression of E. coli-induced NF-kappa B and AP-1 transactivation by
oxyradical signaling.

Transactivation of the DNA-binding proteins nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B)
and activator protein (AP)-1 by de novo oxyradical generation is a stereotypic
redox-sensitive process during hypoxic stress of the liver. Systemic trauma is
associated with splanchnic hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) followed by intraportal
gram-negative bacteremia, which collectively have been implicated in
posttraumatic liver dysfunction and multiple organ damage. We hypothesized that
hypoxic stress of the liver before stimulation by Escherichia coli serotype
O55:B5 (EC) amplifies oxyradical-mediated transactivation of NF-kappa B and AP-1 
as well as cytokine production compared with noninfectious H/R or gram-negative
sepsis without prior hypoxia. Livers from Sprague-Dawley rats underwent perfusion
for 180 min with or without 0.5 h of hypoxia (perfusate PO(2), 40 +/- 5 mmHg)
followed by reoxygenation and infection with 10(9) EC or 0.9% NaCl infusion. In
H/R + EC livers, nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B and AP-1 was unexpectedly
reduced in gel shift assays vs. normoxic EC controls, as were perfusate TNF-alpha
and IL-1 beta levels. Preceding hypoxic stress paradoxically increased
postbacteremic reduced-to-oxidized glutathione ratios plus nuclear localization
of I kappa B alpha and phospho-I kappa B alpha, but not JunB/FosB profiles.
Notably, xanthine oxidase inhibition increased transactivation as well as
cytokine production in H/R + EC livers. Thus brief hypoxic stress of the liver
before intraportal gram-negative bacteremia potently suppresses activation of
canonical redox-sensitive transcription factors and production of inflammatory
cytokines by mechanisms including xanthine oxidase-induced oxyradicals
functioning in an anti-inflammatory signaling role. These results suggest a novel
multifunctionality of oxyradicals in decoupling hepatic transcriptional activity 
and cytokine biosynthesis early in the posttraumatic milieu.

Cocaine-induced intracellular signaling and gene expression are oppositely
regulated by the dopamine D1 and D3 receptors.

Cincinnati Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio 45267, USA.

Repeated exposure to cocaine can induce neuroadaptations in the brain. One
mechanism by which persistent changes occur involves alterations in gene
expression mediated by the dopamine receptors. Both the dopamine D1 and D3
receptors have been shown to mediate gene expression changes. Moreover, the D1
and D3 receptors are also coexpressed in the same neurons, particularly in the
nucleus accumbens and also caudoputamen (CPu). Little is known however, whether
these two receptors coordinately regulate gene expression after cocaine
administration and the underlying mechanisms. We have used various gene mutant
mice to address this issue. We show that extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) activation and c-fos induction in the CPu in response to acute cocaine
administration is mediated by the D1 receptor and inhibited by the D3 receptor.
Moreover, ERK activation mediates acute cocaine-induced expression of Fos family 
genes, including c-fos, fosB and fra2. Interestingly, dynorphin, neogenin, and
synaptotagmin VII, genes that possess cAMP-response element binding protein and
AP-1 transcription complex-binding consensus sequences in their promoters, are
also oppositely regulated by the D1 and D3 receptors after repeated exposure to
cocaine. Furthermore, such regulation depends on proper ERK activation and c-fos 
function. These results suggest that the D1 and D3 receptors elicit opposite
regulation of target gene expression by regulating ERK activation and c-fos
induction after acute and chronic cocaine treatment.

Effects of pulsatile L-DOPA treatment in the double lesion rat model of
striatonigral degeneration (multiple system atrophy).

We examined the role of a striatal lesion in the development of L-DOPA-induced
abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) using the double lesion rat model of
striatonigral degeneration (SND), the underlying neuropathological substrate of
parkinsonism associated with multiple system atrophy (MSA-P), in comparison to a 
Parkinson's disease (PD) rat model. L-DOPA administration reliably induced AIMs
in SND and PD rats in a dose-dependent fashion. AIMs occurred significantly
earlier in SND compared to PD rats. There was a mild, but significant, transient 
increase of orolingual AIMs during the first week of low-dose L-DOPA treatment in
SND. Whereas L-DOPA significantly improved contralateral forelimb akinesia in PD 
rats, there was no beneficial effect in SND rats. Striatal FosB/Delta FosB
up-regulation in SND and PD rats correlated with the severity of L-DOPA-induced
dyskinesias. Pulsatile L-DOPA administration in the double lesion SND rat model
replicates salient features of the human disease MSA-P, including loss of the
anti-akinetic L-DOPA response and induction of dyskinesias with transient
orolingual predominance.

DeltaFosB induces osteosclerosis and decreases adipogenesis by two independent
cell-autonomous mechanisms.

Osteoblasts and adipocytes may develop from common bone marrow mesenchymal
precursors. Transgenic mice overexpressing DeltaFosB, an AP-1 transcription
factor, under the control of the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter show both
markedly increased bone formation and decreased adipogenesis. To determine
whether the two phenotypes were linked, we targeted overexpression of DeltaFosB
in mice to the osteoblast by using the osteocalcin (OG2) promoter. OG2-DeltaFosB 
mice demonstrated increased osteoblast numbers and an osteosclerotic phenotype
but normal adipocyte differentiation. This result firmly establishes that the
skeletal phenotype is cell autonomous to the osteoblast lineage and independent
of adipocyte formation. It also strongly suggests that the decreased fat
phenotype of NSE-DeltaFosB mice is independent of the changes in the osteoblast
lineage. In vitro, overexpression of DeltaFosB in the preadipocytic 3T3-L1 cell
line had little effect on adipocyte differentiation, whereas it prevented the
induction of adipogenic transcription factors in the multipotential stromal cell 
line ST2. Also, DeltaFosB isoforms bound to and altered the DNA-binding capacity 
of C/EBPbeta. Thus, the inhibitory effect of DeltaFosB on adipocyte
differentiation appears to occur at early stages of stem cell commitment,
affecting C/EBPbeta functions. It is concluded that the changes in osteoblast and
adipocyte differentiation in DeltaFosB transgenic mice result from independent
cell-autonomous mechanisms.

Chronic treatment with atypical neuroleptics induces striosomal FosB/DeltaFosB
expression in rats.

Grande C(1), Zhu H, Martin AB, Lee M, Ortiz O, Hiroi N, Moratalla R.

Author information: 
(1)Cajal Institute (CG, ABM, OO, RM), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones
Científicas, Madrid, Spain.

BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that neuroleptics regulate expression of the
transcription factor FosB/DeltaFosB in the striatum, including the accumbens and 
caudate-putamen; however, the striatum is also divided into another structural
dimension, the striosome and matrix compartments. The precise distribution of
FosB/DeltaFosB induced by chronic neuroleptics in these striatal compartments is 
poorly understood.
METHODS: Rats received either single acute injections or chronic injections of
clozapine (0 or 20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally [IP]), olanzapine (0 or 5 mg/kg, IP),
or haloperidol (0 or 1.5 mg/kg, IP) for 25 days. The levels and compartmental
distribution of FosB/DeltaFosB were examined.
RESULTS: Chronic clozapine induced clustered FosB/DeltaFosB expression within
striosomes of the caudate-putamen. This pattern was due to increased levels of
FosB/DeltaFosB in striosomes within the ventrolateral caudate-putamen and reduced
levels of basal FosB/DeltaFosB in the matrix in the entire caudate-putamen. In
contrast, chronic haloperidol increased FosB/DeltaFosB equally within the matrix 
and striosomes throughout the entire caudate-putamen. Chronic olanzapine induced 
an intermediate pattern.
CONCLUSIONS: The relative absence of FosB/DeltaFosB expression in the matrix
correlates with the lack of parkinsonism of atypical neuroleptics. Expression of 
FosB/DeltaFosB in the matrix may contribute to parkinsonism of typical
neuroleptics.

The human placenta is a tissue with a unique capacity for rapid, but--as opposed 
to malignant tumours--tightly controlled proliferation and invasion capacity. The
members of the activating protein-1 (AP-1) family of transcription factors are
key regulators of cellular proliferation, differentiation and invasion processes 
in many systems and could, thus, play an important role in regulating these
processes in the human placenta as well. In the present study, we used
immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies against all members of the AP-1
family (c-Jun, JunB, JunD and c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2) to investigate their
expression pattern and tissue localization in the human placenta. With the
exception of c-Jun, which was expressed in a small fraction of villous
cytotrophoblast nuclei and JunD, expressed in some syncytiotrophoblast nuclei,
all other members of the AP-1 family were completely absent from villous cyto-
and syncytiotrophoblast. Interestingly, most AP-1 factors were expressed in the
intermediate (extravillous) trophoblast, with expression being strongest for JunD
and Fra2 (100% of nuclei showing strong expression), followed by c-Jun (80%
positive nuclei), c-Fos and FosB (50% positive nuclei). This was true for samples
of both first trimester and later pregnancy. These data show that, in the human
placenta, the AP-1 transcription factors are specifically expressed in the
intermediate (extravillous) trophoblast, were they could be implicated in
regulating proliferation, differentiation and/or expression of invasion-specific 
molecules, such as matrix metalloproteinases, which have been shown to be
regulated by AP-1 in vitro and are expressed by the invasive trophoblast.

To evaluate whether in vivo glutamate signals modulate signaling processes
mediated by antioxidant-response element (ARE), we examined ARE binding in
nuclear extracts from the hippocampus after in vivo treatment of mice with
kainate. Enhancement of ARE binding was found at 2 h to 3 days after kainate
treatment. Supershift analysis indicated possible involvement of Nrf2, Fos-B, and
c-Fos in ARE binding in hippocampal nuclear extracts obtained from
kainate-treated animals. On super-supershift analysis by combination of these
antibodies, ARE probe/protein complex was shifted by the anti-Fos-B antibody
alone, but not by the anti-c-Fos antibody alone, and further addition of the
anti-Nrf2 antibody dramatically eliminated binding of the complex shifted by the 
anti-Fos-B antibody in hippocampal nuclear extracts from kainate-treated animals.
Kainate treatment induced a profound increase in levels of c-Fos and Fos-B,
without markedly affecting that of Nrf2 in nuclear extracts from the hippocampus.
Co-localization of Nrf2 with both Fos-B and c-Fos was found in neuronal cell
layers of the hippocampus in kainate-treated animals. RT-PCR analysis revealed
that kainate treatment increases glutathione-S-transferase mRNA level in the
hippocampus. Taken together, kainate signals may enhance nuclear ARE binding
through an interaction between constitutive Nrf2 with inducible Fos-B expressed
in murine hippocampus.

Several cascades of changes in gene expression have been shown to be involved in 
the neuronal injury after transient cerebral ischemia; however, little is known
about the profile of genes showing alteration of expression in a mouse model of
transient forebrain ischemia. We analyzed the gene expression profile in the
mouse hippocampus during 24 h of reperfusion, after 20 min of transient forebrain
ischemia, using a high-density oligonucleotide DNA array. Using statistical
filtration (Welch's ANOVA and Welch's t-test), we identified 25 genes with a more
than 3.0-fold higher or lower level of expression on average, with statistical
significance set at p<0.05, in at least one ischemia-reperfusion group than in
the sham group. Using unsupervised clustering methods (hierarchical clustering
and k-means clustering algorithms), we identified four types of gene expression
pattern that may be associated with the response of cell populations in the
hippocampus to an ischemic insult in this mouse model. Functional classification 
of the 25 genes demonstrated alterations of expression of several kinds of
biological pathways, regulating transcription (Bhlhb2, Jun, c-fos, Egr1, Egr2,
Fosb, Junb, Ifrd1, Neurod6), the cell cycle (c-fos, Fosb, Jun, Junb, Dusp1),
stress response (Dusp1, Dnajb1, Dnaja4), chaperone activity (Dnajb1, Dnaja4) and 
cell death (Ptgs2, Gadd45g, Tdag51), in the mouse hippocampus by 24 h of
reperfusion. Using hierarchical clustering analysis, we also found that the same 
25 genes clearly discriminated between the sham group and the
ischemia-reperfusion groups. The alteration of expression of 25 genes identified 
in this study suggests the involvement of these genes in the transcriptional
response of cell populations in the mouse hippocampus after transient forebrain
ischemia.

Cardiovascular regulation of supraoptic neurons in the rat: synaptic inputs and
cellular signals.

The supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus contains a population of neurons that 
project to the posterior pituitary where they release peptides into systemic
circulation. The system has two main secretory products--vasopressin and
oxytocin. The main systemic affects of vasopressin are related to body fluid
homeostasis while circulating oxytocin is involved in parturition and lactation. 
The circulating levels of both hormones are, to a large part, determined by the
electrical activity of the supraoptic neurons and other neurosecretory cells,
which is in turn determined by synaptic inputs. More recent work suggests that
there may be other dimensions to the cellular response of supraoptic neurons to
these synaptic inputs. For example, it has been demonstrated that supraoptic
neurons alter their synthesis of vasopressin and oxytocin in response to
prolonged stimulation and that the morphology of cells in the supraoptic nucleus 
and its number of synaptic inputs change with the physiological conditions of the
animal. These responses would appear to require some type of activity-dependent
set of cellular signals. Candidates for such signals include members of the AP-1 
transcription factor family whose expression in neurons has been linked to
synaptic stimulation. This review will describe the effects of
cardiovascular-related stimuli on the expression of different members of the AP-1
family in the supraoptic nucleus.

Placental growth factor induces FosB and c-Fos gene expression via Flt-1
receptors.

Holmes DI(1), Zachary I.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, The Rayne Building, University College London, 5
University Street, London WC1E 6JJ, UK.

Placental growth factor (PlGF) is a member of the vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) family that binds specifically to Flt-1. The biological roles of
PlGF and Flt-1 have not yet been defined and the signalling mechanisms mediating 
cellular actions of PlGF remain poorly understood. In human umbilical vein
endothelial cells, VEGF and PlGF induced expression of both full-length FosB mRNA
and an alternatively spliced variant, DeltaFosB, with similar efficacy and
kinetics. In contrast, PlGF induced c-Fos expression less strongly than VEGF, and
whereas VEGF strongly upregulated tissue factor mRNA, PlGF had a negligible
effect. PlGF induced c-Fos expression in porcine aortic endothelial cells
specifically expressing Flt-1, and FosB expression in the monocytic RAW 264.7
cell line expressing endogenous Flt-1. These findings show for the first time
that VEGF and PlGF induce mRNA expression of the transcription factors FosB and
c-Fos, and suggest that these factors may play a role in the biological responses
mediated by PlGF and Flt-1.

During human melanoma progression AP-1 binding pairs are altered with loss of

California, Irvine, Orange, CA 92868, USA.

We demonstrated previously that c-Jun, JunB and c-Fos RNA were dysregulated in
metastatic melanoma cells compared with normal human melanocytes. The purpose of 
this study was to evaluate the distribution in composition of AP-1 dimers in
human melanoma pathogenesis. We investigated AP-1 dimer pairing in radial growth 
phase-like (RGP) (w3211) and vertical growth phase-like (VGP) (w1205) human
melanoma cells and metastatic cell lines (cloned from patients, c83-2c, c81-46A, 
A375, respectively) compared with melanocytes using electrophoretic mobility
shift assay (EMSA), Western blot and transfection analyses. There are progressive
variations in AP-1 composition in different melanoma cell lines compared with
normal melanocytes, in which c-Jun, JunD and FosB were involved in AP-1
complexes. In w3211, c-Jun, JunD and Fra-1 were involved in AP-1 binding, while
in w1205, overall AP-1 binding activity was decreased significantly and
supershift binding was detected only with JunD antibodies. In metastatic c81-46A 
and A375 cells, only JunD was involved in AP-1 binding activity, but in a third
(c83-2c) c-Jun, JunD and Fra-1 were present. Western blot evaluation detected
c-Jun in melanocytes and w3211, but this component was decreased significantly or
was not detectable in w1205, c81-46A and A375 cells. In contrast, JunD protein
was elevated in c81-46A and c83-2c cells compared with melanocytes and RGP and
VGP cell lines. Normal melanocytes and c83-2c cells (which have c-Jun involved in
AP-1 binding), transfected with c-Jun antisense and treated with cisplatin,
showed higher viability compared with untransfected cells, while in c81-46A cells
(in which only JunD is detectable) no change in cell viability was observed
following treatment with cisplatin and c-jun antisense transfection. A
dominant-negative c-Jun mutant (TAM67) significantly increased the soft agar
colony formation of w3211 and c83-2c cells. These results suggest that components
of AP-1, especially c-Jun, may offer a new target for the prevention or treatment
of human melanoma progression.

Mechanistic diversity of fosfomycin resistance in pathogenic microorganisms.

Tennessee 37232-0146, USA.

Microbial resistance to the antibiotic fosfomycin [(1R,2S)-epoxypropylphosphonic 
acid, 1] is known to be mediated by thiol transferase enzymes FosA and FosB,
which catalyze the addition of glutathione and l-cysteine to C1 of the oxirane,
respectively. A probe of the microbial genome database reveals a related group of
enzymes (FosX). The genes mlr3345 from Mesorhizobium loti and lmo1702 from
Listeria monocytogenes were cloned and the proteins expressed. This heretofore
unrecognized group of enzymes is shown to catalyze the Mn(II)-dependent addition 
of water to C1 of the oxirane. The ability of each enzyme to confer resistance in
Escherichia coli is correlated with their catalytic efficiency, such that the M. 
loti protein confers low resistance while the Listeria enzyme confers very robust
resistance. The crystal structure of the FosX from M. loti was solved at a
resolution of 1.83 A. The structure reveals an active-site carboxylate (E44)
located about 5 A from the expected position of the substrate that appears to be 
poised to participate in catalysis. Single turnover experiments in H218O and
kinetic analysis of the E44G mutant of the FosX enzymes indicate that the
carboxylate of E44 acts as a general base in the direct addition of water to 1.
The FosX from M. loti also catalyzes the addition of glutathione to the
antibiotic. The catalytic promiscuity and low efficiency of the M. loti protein
suggest that it may be an intermediate in the evolution of clinically relevant
fosfomycin resistance proteins such as the FosX from Listeria monocytogenese.

Activator protein-1 (AP-1) is a transcription factor activated in many tumors.
Using 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO)-induced rat tongue cancers (TC), the
present study investigated the expression levels of genes that encode the
components of AP-1, the jun gene family (c-jun, junB and junD) and the fos gene
family (c-fos, fra-1, fra-2 and fosB). Expression levels of junB and c-fos mRNAs 
in TC were significantly elevated compared with those in epithelial tissue of
control rat tongue, although only c-fos mRNA levels tended to be elevated in
dysplastic tongue epithelium. Histologically, all 4NQO-induced rat TC were
well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas. Immunostaining for JunB and c-Fos
proteins was positive in the nuclei of tumor cells of all TC. It is noteworthy
that JunB was negative, but c-Fos was positive in the dysplastic tongue
epithelium of the 4NQO-treated rats. Immunostaining for both proteins was
negative in tongue mucosal epithelium of control rats. There were no mutations in
the coding regions of either junB or c-fos in all the TC examined. These results 
suggest the possibility that the expressions of junB and c-fos were enhanced
stepwise in 4NQO-induced carcinogenesis of rat tongue, and that the coexpression 
of JunB and c-Fos might play an important role in the establishment of TC.

Interaction with GATA transcription factors provides a mechanism for
cell-specific effects of c-Fos.

recherches cliniques de Montréal, 110, avenue des Pins Ouest, Montréal, QC,

c-Fos is a multifunctional transcription factor that is involved in cellular
proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. c-Fos is rapidly induced by a
variety of hormones, growth factors and other extracellular stimuli, resulting in
cell-specific responses. One potential mechanism underlying the cell-specific
effects of c-Fos may be its ability to regulate gene expression through
interaction with tissue-restricted transcription factors. We report here that
c-Fos interacts with the cell-specific GATA proteins to potentiate their ability 
to transactivate target promoters, via GATA-binding sites. c-Fos is recruited to 
GATA proteins through direct interaction with their N-terminal activation domain.
Neither the leucine zipper nor the DNA-binding domain of c-Fos is required for
physical interaction with GATA proteins. Instead, a C-terminal domain located
between amino acids 235 and 296, which is conserved in FosB but not in the
nontransforming Fos family members, FosB/SF or Fra-1, is essential for c-Fos-GATA
interaction. These data suggest that c-Fos may act as an inducible cofactor for
cell-specific transcription factors and unravel a novel mechanism for
transcriptional regulation by c-Fos, independent of the well-studied AP-1
pathway. The results also raise the possibility that dysregulated interaction
with cell-specific transcription factors may be an important component in
cellular transformation by nuclear oncogenes.

Estradiol differentially regulates c-Fos after focal cerebral ischemia.

Lexington, Kentucky 40536, USA.

Estrogen replacement therapy enhances mood, delays cognitive decline, and reduces
the risk of neurodegeneration. Our laboratory has shown previously that
pretreatment with low physiological levels of estradiol protects against middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced brain injury during late phases of
neuronal cell death. Immediate early genes (IEGs) are induced by various forms of
brain injury, and their induction is known to be a critical step in programmed
cell death. The current study tested the hypothesis that the ability of estradiol
to reduce MCAO-induced cell death involves attenuation of expression of one or
more IEGs. We examined the effects of MCAO on the temporospatial pattern of IEG
expression and the modulation of this pattern by estradiol replacement. Rats were
ovariectomized and treated with either vehicle or low physiological
concentrations of estradiol. One week later, rats underwent MCAO and brains were 
collected 1, 4, 8, 16, and 24 hr later. We assessed IEG mRNAs in discrete regions
of brain by RT-PCR at 24 hr. We examined expression of c-Fos mRNA and protein in 
greater detail using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to delineate 
the time course and specific regions of cortex in which estradiol influenced its 
expression. Our results reveal that c-fos, fosB, c-jun, and junB levels were
upregulated at 24 hr. Furthermore, estradiol selectively affected the expression 
of c-Fos mRNA and protein by attenuating the injury-induced increase in a time-
and region-specific manner. Our findings strongly suggest that the ability of
estradiol to protect against MCAO-induced cell death involves attenuation of
c-Fos induction.

In March 2003, a novel coronavirus was isolated from patients exhibiting atypical
pneumonia and subsequently proven to be the causative agent of the disease now
referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The complete genome of
the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has since been sequenced. The SARS-CoV
nucleocapsid (SARS-CoV N) shares little homology with other members of the
coronavirus family. To determine if the N protein is involved in the regulation
of cellular signal transduction, an ELISA-based assay on transcription factors
was used. We found that the amount of transcription factors binding to promoter
sequences of c-Fos, ATF2, CREB-1, and FosB was increased by the expression of
SARS-CoV N. Since these factors are related to AP-1 signal transduction pathway, 
we investigated whether the AP-1 pathway was activated by SARS-CoV N protein
using the PathDetect system. The results demonstrated that the expression of N
protein, not the membrane protein (M), activated AP-1 pathway. We also found that
SARS-CoV N protein does not activate NF-kappaB pathway, demonstrating that
activation of important cellular pathways by SAS-CoV N protein is selective. Thus
our data for the first time indicate that SARS-CoV has encoded a strategy to
regulate cellular signaling process.

and Center for Basic Neuroscience, 5323 Harry Hines Boulevard, Dallas, Texas

DeltaFosB (a truncated form of FosB) and CREB (cAMP response element binding
protein) are transcription factors induced in the brain's reward pathways after
chronic exposure to drugs of abuse. However, their mechanisms of action and the
genes they regulate remain unclear. Using microarray analysis in the nucleus
accumbens of inducible transgenic mice, we found that CREB and a
dominant-negative CREB have opposite effects on gene expression, as do prolonged 
expression of DeltaFosB and the activator protein-1 (AP-1) antagonist DeltacJun. 
However, unlike CREB, short-term and prolonged DeltaFosB induction had opposing
effects on gene expression. Gene expression induced by short-term DeltaFosB and
by CREB was strikingly similar, and both reduced the rewarding effects of
cocaine, whereas prolonged DeltaFosB expression increased drug reward. Gene
expression after a short cocaine treatment was more dependent on CREB, whereas
gene expression after a longer cocaine treatment became increasingly DeltaFosB
dependent. These findings help define the molecular functions of CREB and
DeltaFosB and identify clusters of genes that contribute to cocaine addiction.

Dominant-negative effect of the c-fos family gene products on inducible NO
synthase expression in macrophages.

Activation of murine peritoneal macrophages or the macrophage cell line RAW264
with IFN-gamma and bacterial lipopolysaccharide promotes a transient
up-regulation of c-fos family gene expression following inducible NO synthase
(iNOS) production. Since introduction of a double mutation into the two
AP-1-binding sites in the iNOS promoter region reduced the promoter activity to
25% of the authentic one in activated RAW264 cells, the induced c-Fos/AP-1 may
promote iNOS expression in activated macrophages. Surprisingly, overexpression of
c-fos in activated macrophages completely suppressed the production of iNOS, but 
not that of IL-6 and IL-1beta. The regulatory effect was also observed by
overexpression of c-fos, c-jun or fosB on the promoter activity as deduced from
transfection experiments. However, the mutation of AP-1-binding sites in the
promoter region did not abrogate the regulatory effect of c-fos and the effect of
c-fos was diminished by co-transfection with c-jun, but not with fosB, suggesting
no relation between the regulatory effect and a c-Fos/AP-1 complex. Expression of
NF-IL6 (C/EBPbeta), whose gene product can make a non-functional heterodimer with
c-Fos family proteins, was transiently induced in activated macrophages.
Overexpression of NF-IL6 in activated RAW264 cells augmented iNOS promoter
activity and reduced the regulatory effect of c-fos overexpression. Thus,
overproduction of c-Fos family proteins acts as a dominant-negative-type
regulator on iNOS expression in activated macrophages.

Spermidine (SPD) and spermine (SPN) have been shown to be endogenous agonists for
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors that could lead to expression of the
nuclear transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP1) complex in the mammalian
central nervous system both in vitro and in vivo. In nuclear extracts of murine
whole brain, AP1 DNA binding increased significantly in a concentration-dependent
manner with the addition of either SPD or SPN at a concentration range of 50-500 
microM. Similarly, the nuclear proteins histone and dephosphorylated casein, but 
not phosphorylated casein, significantly increased AP1 DNA binding alone but in
the presence of either SPD or SPN did not increase further binding. By contrast, 
another endogenous polyamine, putrescine, significantly prevented AP1 DNA binding
increases by histone and dephosphorylated casein, but did not by itself
significantly alter binding. Invariably, SPD and SPN effected significantly
increased AP1 DNA binding in neocortex, hippocampus, striatum, midbrain,
hypothalamus and cerebellum, but not in medulla-pons and spinal cord. Supershift 
and Western blotting analyses revealed relatively high constitutive expression of
Fos-B protein in neocortex and hippocampus, but not in medulla-pons and spinal
cord. Immunoprecipitation of Fos-B led to complete abolition of the ability of
SPN and SPD to increase AP1 DNA binding in neocortical and hippocampal nuclear
extracts. These results suggest that expression of Fos-B protein may be required 
for modulation of nuclear gene transcription by both SPD and SPN through
stimulation DNA-binding activity of AP1 complex in murine central structures.

Using gene expression profiling to identify the molecular basis of the
synergistic actions of hepatocyte growth factor and vascular endothelial growth
factor in human endothelial cells.

Francisco, CA 94080, USA. meg570@comcast.net

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF)
are two potent endothelial mitogens with demonstrated angiogenic activities in
animal models of therapeutic angiogenesis. Several recent studies suggest that
these growth factors may act synergistically, although the mechanism of this
interaction is not understood. Changes in the gene expression profile of human
umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with HGF, VEGF or the combination of the
two were analyzed with high-density oligonucleotide arrays, representing
approximately 22000 genes. Notably, the genes significantly up- and downregulated
by VEGF versus HGF exhibited very little overlap, indicating distinct signal
transduction pathways. The combination of HGF and VEGF markedly increased the
number of significantly up- and downregulated genes. At 4 h, the combination of
the two growth factors induced a number of chemokine and cytokines and their
receptors (IL-8, IL-6, IL-11, CCR6, CXCR1,CXC1 and IL17RC), numerous genes
involved in growth factor signal transduction (egr-1, fosB, grb10,
grb14,MAP2K3,MAP3K8, MAPKAP2,MPK3, DUSP4 and DUSP6), as well as a number of other
growth factors (PDGFA, BMP2, Hb-EGF, FGF16, heuregulin beta 1, c-kit ligand,
angiopoietin 2 and angiopoietin 4 and VEGFC). In addition, the VEGF receptors
neuropilin-1 and flt-1 were also upregulated. At 24 h, a clear 'cell cycle'
signature is noted, with the upregulated expression of various cell cycle control
proteins and gene involved in the regulation of mitosis and mitotic spindle
assembly. The receptor for HGF, c-met, is also upregulated. These data are
consistent with the hypothesis that the combination of HGF and VEGF results in
the cooperative upregulation of a number of different molecular pathways leading 
to a more robust proliferative response, that is, growth factor(s), receptors,
molecules involved in growth factor signal transduction, as well as, at later
time points, upregulation of the necessary cellular proteins required for cells
to escape cell cycle arrest and enter the cell cycle.

Hypertrophic agonists induce the binding of c-Fos to an AP-1 site in cardiac
myocytes: implications for the expression of GLUT1.

OBJECTIVES: Serum is among the agents known to induce hypertrophy of cardiac
myocytes, which occurs concomitant with an increase in AP-1-mediated
transcription. We have examined if this effect correlates with changes in the
relative abundance of particular AP-1 heterodimers, as their exact composition
under these conditions is unknown. Furthermore, we obtained insight on the
specific role of c-Fos from studying the induction of the glucose transporter
GLUT1 by serum in fibroblasts.
METHODS: We characterised the AP-1 heterodimers expressed in neonatal cardiac
myocytes by supershift electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis.
Quantitative changes in transcription were measured using a luciferase reporter
vector, and we examined the expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 in
cardiac myocytes and a c-Fos knockout-derived fibroblast cell line by western
blotting.
RESULTS: Transcriptionally active AP-1 in combinations of c-Jun, JunD and JunB
with Fra1, Fra2 and possibly FosB, are expressed in cardiac myocytes.
Hypertrophic stimuli transiently induced AP-1 dimers containing c-Fos, and this
was dependent on the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and coincided
with the activation of AP-1-mediated transcription and the induction of GLUT1 in 
cardiac myocytes. In fibroblasts, the induction of GLUT1 by serum required the
specific expression of c-Fos.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that induction of c-Fos containing AP-1 heterodimers
may partly activate AP-1-mediated transcription in cardiac myocytes treated with 
hypertrophic agonists under conditions known to induce GLUT1. Data obtained in
fibroblasts treated with serum lead us to hypothesise that c-Fos might play a
major role in the regulation of GLUT1 expression.

IgE plus antigen-stimulated mast cells degranulate, synthesize leukotrienes and
secrete cytokines. According to the coalescence model this process is initiated
in specific membrane compartments termed rafts. There, enhanced levels of
glycosphingolipids and cholesterol stabilize the interaction of FcepsilonRI and
Lyn, and thus facilitate the first steps of signal transduction. Enforced changes
in raft architecture by cholesterol deprivation and exogenous application of
glycosphingolipids influence these early events by loss of tyrosine kinase
activity or receptor-independent signal initiation respectively. Here we show
that exogenously added cholesterol accumulates in rafts and activates mast cells.
An investigation of the signaling events reveals that in contrast to IgE plus
antigen-mediated stimulation, cholesterol triggers p38 mitogen-activated protein 
kinase and preferentially induces expression of FosB. Consequently, a comparative
large-scale microarray analysis demonstrates that a number of IgE plus
antigen-induced immediate early genes (peak expression at 30 min after induction)
are repressed by cholesterol. These changes further translate into altered
expression levels and time kinetics of a number of early genes (peak expression
at 2 h after stimulation). As the most prominent example for
cholesterol-dependent genes, we identified PAI1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor 
1), a protein regarded as a risk factor for atherosclerosis.

Parturition plays a critical role in the full expression of maternal behavior in 
postpartum females, yet the precise mechanism remains unclear. Here we examined
the role of parturition in the activation of Fos and FosB in the central oxytocin
receptor (OTR) system in rats. Although expression of FosB, not Fos, was seen in 
the piriform cortex (Pir) and caudate putamen of virgin and pregnant females,
activation of Fos and FosB with extensive co-localization was found in the medial
preoptic area, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and Pir of parturient
brain. This parturition induced activation of Fos and FosB was identified in the 
central OTR-expressing cells as well as in oxytocinergic neurons. Our data
provide direct evidence, for the first time, that parturition activates Fos and
FosB in the central OTR system. We propose that Fos and FosB may have comparable 
functions on initiating maternal behavior at parturition.

(1)Department of Research, Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center, Hartford,
Connecticut 06105-1299, USA.

Notch receptors are single pass transmembrane receptors activated by
membrane-bound ligands with a role in cell proliferation and differentiation. As 
Notch 1 and 2 mRNAs are expressed by osteoblasts and induced by cortisol, we
postulated that Notch could regulate osteoblastogenesis. We investigated the
effects of retroviral vectors directing the constitutive expression of the Notch 
1 intracellular domain (NotchIC) in murine ST-2 stromal and in MC3T3 cells.
NotchIC overexpression was documented by increased Notch 1 transcripts and
activity of the Notch-dependent Hairy Enhancer of Split promoter. In the presence
of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), ST-2 cells differentiated toward
osteoblasts forming mineralized nodules, and Notch 1 opposed this effect and
decreased the expression of osteocalcin, type I collagen, and alkaline
phosphatase transcripts and Delta2Delta FosB protein. Further, NotchIC decreased 
Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. As cells differentiated in the presence of BMP-2,
they underwent apoptosis, and Notch opposed this event. In the presence of
cortisol, NotchIC induced the formation of mature adipocytes and enhanced the
effect of cortisol on adipsin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2 
and CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha and delta mRNA levels. NotchIC also
opposed MC3T3 cell differentiation and the expression of a mature osteoblastic
phenotype. In conclusion, NotchIC impairs osteoblast differentiation and enhances
adipogenesis in stromal cell cultures.

Region-specific changes in immediate early gene expression in response to sleep
deprivation and recovery sleep in the mouse brain.

(1)Molecular Neurobiology Laboratory, SRI International, 333 Ravenswood Avenue,
Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA.

Previous studies have documented changes in expression of the immediate early
gene (IEG) c-fos and Fos protein in the brain between sleep and wakefulness. Such
expression differences implicate changes in transcriptional regulation across
behavioral states and suggest that other transcription factors may also be
affected. In the current study, we examined the expression of seven fos/jun
family member mRNAs (c-fos, fosB, fos related antigen (fra)1, fra-2, junB, c-jun,
and junD) and three other IEG mRNAs (egr-1, egr-3, and nur77) in mouse brain
following short-term (6 h) sleep deprivation (SD) and 4 h recovery sleep (RS)
after SD. Gene expression was quantified in seven brain regions by real-time
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Multivariate analysis
of variance revealed statistically significant variation in cerebral cortex,
basal forebrain, thalamus and cerebellum. Levels of c-fos and fosB mRNA were
elevated during SD in all four of these brain regions. In the cerebral cortex,
junB mRNA was also elevated during SD whereas, in the basal forebrain, fra-1 and 
fra-2 mRNA levels increased in this condition. During RS, the only IEG mRNA to
undergo significant increase was fra-2 in the cortex. C-jun and junD mRNAs were
invariant across experimental conditions. These results indicate that the
expression of fos/jun family members is diverse during SD. Among other IEGs,
nur77 mRNA expression across conditions was similar to c-fos and fosB, egr-1 mRNA
was elevated during SD in the cortex and basal forebrain, and egr-3 mRNA was
elevated in the cortex during both SD and RS. The similarity of fosB and nur77
expression to c-fos expression indicates that these genes might also be useful
markers of functional activity. Along with our previous results, the increased
levels of fra-2 and egr-3 mRNAs during RS reported here suggest that increased
mRNA expression during sleep is rare and may be anatomically restricted.

AP1 genes in Fugu indicate a divergent transcriptional control to that of
mammals.

Cottage AJ(1), Edwards YJ, Elgar G.

(1)Medical Research Council, UK Human Genome Mapping Project Resource Centre,
Hinxton, Cambridge, CB 10 1SB, UK.

The draft genomic sequence of the Japanese puffer fish, Fugu rubripes, has now
been announced. This is the first complete sequence of a teleost fish and the
second available vertebrate sequence, the first being that of human. For the
first time, whole-genome comparisons between two vertebrates can be undertaken.
Early analysis has suggested that there may be surprising differences in gene
regulation between human and fish. In mammals, a gene commonly has several
functions, and this may not always be the case in fish. Many gene families
comprise more members in fish than they do in mammals, possibly because each fish
gene has evolved an individual function. Complexities of gene regulation in
mammals has hampered studies of all biological processes from cell proliferation 
to cell death. Determining the activities of the AP1 transcription factor
proteins has been non-trivial. The AP1 complex typically comprises two proteins, 
a Jun (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) and a Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra1, and Fra2). These
proteins can form both homodimers and heterodimers among-themselves and can
interact with additional proteins; thus, dissecting their individual roles has
been difficult. We have determined that Fugu has more Jun and Fos genes than
mammals, and if each proves to have a separate function, then addressing the
roles of the individual AP1 proteins in Fugu may be simpler than in human.

BACKGROUND: The intestinal mitosis-inhibiting peptide pyroglu-His-GlyOH (pEHG),
inhibits normal intestinal epithelial cells and the human colon adenocarcinoma
cell line HT-29 and increases the expression of c-fos (1). In this study, we
investigated the mechanisms of the growth-inhibiting effects of pEHG.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: cDNA expression array was hybridized with cDNA from HT-29 
cells exposed to pEHG or control. The results were confirmed with Northern blot
or real-time PCR.
RESULTS: pEHG(1 nM) provoked a significant increase in the expression of the
early growth response protein 1 (egr-1) after an incubation of 20 minutes, while 
c-fos was confirmed up-regulated by the same treatment. We further studied the
expression of fosB, c-jun and junB, in the AP-1 complex. fosB was up-regulated
20-fold, but only minor effects on jun variants were observed.
CONCLUSION: pEHG stimulates the gene expression of some immediate-early
transcription factors involved in cell proliferation.

The genetic modifier Rpe65Leu(450): effect on light damage susceptibility in
c-Fos-deficient mice.

PURPOSE: To test whether introduction of the Rpe65Leu(450) variant can overcome
protection against light-induced photoreceptor apoptosis in mice without the
activator protein (AP)-1 constituent c-Fos.
METHODS: c-Fos-deficient mice (c-fos(-/-)) carrying the Leu(450) variant of RPE65
were compared with c-fos(-/-) mice with Rpe65Met(450). Expression of RPE65 was
analyzed by Western blot analysis. Rhodopsin regeneration was determined by
measuring rhodopsin after different times in darkness after bleaching.
Susceptibility to light-induced damage was tested by exposure to white light and 
subsequent morphologic analysis. Activation of AP-1 and its complex composition
was analyzed by electromobility shift assay (EMSA) and antibody interference. The
contribution of AP-1 to apoptosis was tested by pharmacological inhibition of
AP-1, using dexamethasone.
RESULTS: Compared with RPE65Met(450), introduction of the RPE65Leu(450) variant
led to increased levels of RPE65 protein, accelerated rhodopsin regeneration,
loss of protection against light-induced damage, and AP-1 responsiveness to toxic
light doses, despite the absence of c-Fos. c-Fos was mainly replaced by Fra-2.
Application of dexamethasone restored resistance to light-induced damage.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing retinal photon catch capacity by introducing the
Rpe65Leu(450) variant overcomes light damage resistance provided by c-fos
deficiency. Thus, a variation of RPE65 at position 450 is a strong genetic
modifier of susceptibility to light-induced damage in mice. Under conditions of
high rhodopsin availability during exposure to light, Fra-2 and, to a minor
degree, FosB substitute for c-Fos and enable light-induced AP-1 activity and thus
photoreceptor apoptosis. Regardless of the AP-1 complex's composition,
glucocorticoid receptor activation inhibits AP-1 and prevents apoptosis. Thus,
not the absence of c-Fos per se, but rather impairment of AP-1 DNA binding is
protective against light-induced damage. This impairment may result from the
absence of c-Fos or glucocorticoid receptor-mediated transrepression.

The fates of Rat1a cells expressing FosB and DeltaFosB as fusion proteins
(ER-FosB, ER-DeltaFosB) with the ligand binding domain of human estrogen receptor
were examined. The binding of estrogen to the fusion proteins resulted in their
nuclear translocation and triggered cell proliferation, and thereafter delayed
cell death was observed only in cells expressing ER-DeltaFosB. The proliferation 
of Rat1a cells, but not cell death triggered by ER-DeltaFosB, was completely
abolished by butyrolactone I, an inhibitor of cycline-dependent kinases, and was 
partly suppressed by antisense oligonucleotides against galectin-1, whose
expression is induced after estrogen administration. The cell death was
accompanied by the activation of caspase-3 and -9, the fragmentation of the
nuclear genome and cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, and was suppressed
by zDEVD-fmk and zLEHD-fmk but not zIETD-fmk. The cell death was not suppressed
by exogenous His-PTD-Bcl-x(L) at all, suggesting involvement of a
Bcl-x(L)-resistant pathway for cytochrome c release.

Different patterns of psychostimulant intake can elicit widely varying behavioral
and neurochemical consequences. Accordingly, rats were studied during withdrawal 
from either of two schedules of amphetamine administration, one consisting of 6
days of low-dose (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) daily intermittent (INT) amphetamine (AMPH)
injections, and the other of 6 days of moderately high-dose (1-5 mg/kg, i.p.)
escalating (ESC) AMPH injections, for the effects of these treatments on numbers 
of FosB-positive nuclei and monoamine utilization in dopaminergic target areas.
Withdrawal from AMPH pretreatment according to the ESC schedule markedly
increased FosB expression in the nucleus accumbens shell and basolateral
amygdala. In contrast, withdrawal from INT-AMPH administration did not increase
FosB expression in any of the regions examined. Post-mortem neurochemical
analyses of these same brain regions did not reveal effects of withdrawal from
either INT or ESC administration of AMPH. These results suggest that withdrawal
from a moderately high-dose AMPH regimen modifies patterns of gene expression in 
mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic target nuclei without significantly affecting
basal monoamine levels. The strength of these effects in the nucleus accumbens
shell and basolateral nucleus of the amygdala are consistent with behavioral and 
clinical data indicating the importance of these areas in the neuroadaptive
changes which characterize addiction and withdrawal states.

We have applied a targeted physical mapping approach, based on the isolation of
bovine region-specific large-insert clones using homologous human sequences and
chromosome microdissection, to enhance the physical gene map of the telomeric
region of BTA18 and to prove its evolutionary conservation. The latter is a
prerequisite to exploit the dense human gene map for future positional cloning
approaches. Partial sequencing and homology search were used to characterize 20
BACs targeted to the BTA18q2.4-q2.6 region. We used fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) to create physical maps of 11 BACs containing 15 gene loci; 
these BACs served as anchor loci. Using these approaches, 12 new gene loci (CKM, 
STK13, PSCD2, IRF3, VASP, ACTN4, ITPKC, CYP2B6, FOSB, DMPK, MIA, SIX5) were
assigned on BTA18 in the bovine cytogenetic map. A resolved physical map of
BTA18q2.4-q2.6 was developed, which encompasses 28 marker loci and a comparative 
cytogenetic map that contains 15 genes. The mapping results demonstrate the high 
evolutionary conservation between the telomeric region of BTA18q and HSA19q.

Molecular targets of 1,25(OH)2D3 in HC11 normal mouse mammary cell line.

Our aim was to determine the molecular targets involved in the antiproliferative 
effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)), in a normal murine
mammary epithelial cell line, HC11. Among the early response genes analyzed,
c-myc, junB, junD, c-jun, c-fos, fosB, fra, as well as max, mad1-4, sin3, only
c-jun and fra-2 mRNAs were up-regulated after 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) exposure. Cyclin C 
was reduced and cyclin A2 and E were slightly enhanced; however, cyclins D1, D3, 
B1, B2, F, G1, G2, I and H, as well as TGF beta 1, TGF beta 3, T beta RI and T
beta RII transcripts were not modulated by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). Although p27(KIP1)
protein content was unchanged, enhancement of p21(WAF1/CIP1) low basal levels in 
cell extracts and IGFBP-3 abundance on the culture medium was detected after
1,25(OH)(2)D(3) induction. Using differential display analysis, we identified
eight down-modulated clones in exposed cells: 26S proteasome non-ATPase subunit
Pad1, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ube2i, extracellular proteinase inhibitor Expi
or Wdnm1, cytochrome-c oxidase Cox7c, microtubule-associated protein-1 light
chain-3 (Map1lc3), nascent-associated complex alpha Naca, transforming acidic
coiled-coil Tacc3, stearoyl-CoA desaturase (Scd), keratin 6 alpha, and 1
up-regulated, fork head transcription factor Hfh-1L. Hence, the antiproliferative
effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) seems associated to enhancement of c-jun, Fra-2, IGFBP3
and p21(WAF1/CIP1). Decreased Pad1 and Ube2i might account for increased
stability of cell cycle inhibitory proteins while reduced Wdnm1, Tacc3 and Scd
might be secondary to accumulation of cells in G0/G1 phase.

An unexpected role for FosB in activation-induced cell death of T cells.

Author information: 
(1)Tumor Immunology Program, Heidelberg, Germany.

The CD95 (APO-1/Fas) system plays a major role in induction of apoptosis in
lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues. The CD95 (APO-1/Fas) ligand (CD95L) is induced 
in response to a variety of signals including TCR/CD3 stimulation or application 
of chemotherapeutic drugs. Here we report that an AP-1 site located in the 5'
untranslated region of the CD95L gene is required for TCR/CD3-mediated induction 
of the human CD95L promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using nuclear 
extracts of Jurkat T cells as well as TCR/CD3-restimulated primary human T cells 
demonstrated specific binding of AP-1, predominantly composed of c-Jun and FosB, 
to this sequence. Ectopic expression of transdominant negative Jun mutants
strongly reduced CD95L promoter activity and activation-induced cell death
(AICD), confirming the functional significance of FosB/c-Jun binding. Thus, our
results demonstrate an important novel function for FosB dimerized with c-Jun in 
TCR/CD3-mediated AICD in human T cells.

Cellular and behavioural effects of the adenosine A2a receptor antagonist KW-6002
in a rat model of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.

Lundblad M(1), Vaudano E, Cenci MA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Physiological Sciences, Wallenberg Neuroscience Centre,
Neurobiology Division, Lund, Sweden.

We have examined the ability of KW-6002, an adenosine A2a antagonist, to modulate
the dyskinetic effects of L-DOPA in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats. In animals
rendered dyskinetic by a previous course of L-DOPA treatment, KW-6002 did not
elicit any abnormal involuntary movements on its own, but failed to reduce the
severity of dyskinesia when coadministered with L-DOPA. A second experiment was
undertaken in order to study the effects of KW-6002 in L-DOPA-naive rats.
Thirty-five animals were allotted to four groups to receive a 21-day treatment
with: (i) KW-6002 (10 mg/kg/day); (ii) L-DOPA (6 mg/kg/day) i.p.; (iii) KW-6002
plus L-DOPA (same doses as above) or (iv) vehicle. Chronic treatment with
KW-6002-only produced a significant relief of motor disability in the rotarod
test in the absence of any abnormal involuntary movements. Combined treatment
with L-DOPA and KW-6002 improved rotarod performance to a significantly higher
degree than did each of the two drugs alone. However, this combined treatment
induced dyskinesia to about the same degree as did L-DOPA alone. In situ
hybridization histochemistry showed that KW-6002 treatment alone caused an
approximately 20% reduction in the striatal levels of preproenkephalin mRNA,
whereas neither the coadministration of KW-6002 and L-DOPA nor L-DOPA alone
significantly altered the expression of this transcript in the
dopamine-denervated striatum. Either alone or in combination with L-DOPA, KW-6002
did not have any modulatory effect on prodynorphin mRNA expression or
FosB/DeltaFosB-like immunoreactivity in the dopamine-denervated striatum. These
results show that monotreatment with an adenosine A2a receptor antagonist can
relieve motor disability without inducing behavioural and cellular signs of
dyskinesia in rats with 6-hydroxydopamine lesions. Cotreatment with KW-6002 and
L-DOPA potentiates the therapeutic effect but not the dyskinesiogenic potential
of the latter drug.

Expression and distribution of AP-1 transcription factors in the porcine ovary.

Rusovici R(1), LaVoie HA.

Author information:

Carolina School of Medicine, Columbia, South Carolina 29208, USA.

The activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors are important regulators of 
cell proliferation and differentiation. The developmental distribution of AP-1
family members in porcine ovary has not been previously investigated. We examined
the expression of AP-1 factors in porcine ovarian follicles, granulosa cells, and
corpora lutea at different stages of development. Immunoblot analyses confirmed
that c-Jun, JunD, JunB, c-Fos, Fra-1, Fra-2, and FosB immunoreactive proteins
were present in whole-cell extracts (WCE) of all antral follicles and midluteal
phase corpora lutea (CL) as well as granulosa cells (GC) isolated from
different-sized antral follicles. The intensities of c-Jun and c-Fos protein
bands were decreased in CL WCE compared to antral follicles. In granulosa cells
from preovulatory follicles (8-10 mm), Fra-2 exhibited a shift from 43 kDa to 46 
kDa when compared to granulosa cells from smaller antral follicles. Separation of
cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts was performed to determine if developmental
differences between these fractions existed. Most AP-1 factors predominated in
the nuclear fraction with notable exceptions. c-Fos predominated in the nucleus
in GC and follicles but predominated in the cytoplasmic fraction of CL. With the 
exception of GC from 1-2-mm follicles, in which expression was similar between
fractions, Fos-B was found predominantly in the cytoplasmic fraction. Fra-1
exhibited similar expression between cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions for all
tissues. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses of porcine ovary sections were
performed to determine the cellular distribution of these factors at different
follicular stages, and immunopositive nuclei were evaluated. In primordial and
primary unilaminar follicles, all AP-1 factors studied except for FosB were
detected in granulosa nuclei. Granulosa cell nuclei of multilaminar preantral
follicles were immunopositive for all factors, with lower expression of FosB.
Antral follicles exhibited GC and thecal cell nuclear staining for all factors
with the exception of FosB in theca. Luteal cells exhibited the most intense
nuclear staining for JunD and Fra-2, whereas all other factors were present in
luteal cell nuclei although to a lesser extent. IHC with FosB antibodies yielded 
mostly cytoplasmic staining but only weak luteal nuclear staining. In corpora
albicantia, low levels of staining were seen for all AP-1 factors. The
DNA-binding abilities of these factors in granulosa cells and CL were evaluated
by EMSA. Nuclear extracts from granulosa cells from 1-2-mm or 8-10-mm antral
follicles bound an AP-1 DNA consensus sequence and complexes consisted
predominantly of c-Jun, JunD, JunB, c-Fos, and Fra-2. In CL, c-Jun, JunD, JunB,
and Fra-2 were present in DNA-binding complexes, and c-Fos binding was not
detected. In conclusion, our results suggest that expression and DNA-binding
activity of AP-1 factors in follicular structures changes with luteinization.
Differentiation to the luteal phenotype involves a reduction in nuclear c-Jun and
c-Fos and a predominance of JunD and Fra-2.

FosB is highly expressed in normal mammary epithelia, but down-regulated in
poorly differentiated breast carcinomas.

FosB is a member of the AP-1 family of transcription factors which represent
important regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation. Based on prior
results which indicated a role of FosB in breast cancer, we studied FosB protein 
and mRNA expression by immunohistochemistry and, partly, in situ hybridization in
68 mammary carcinomas and normal breast tissues. We found strong nuclear FosB
immunoreactivity in epithelial cells of normal lobules and ducts, whereas
carcinomas frequently showed loss of FosB expression (n = 8) or weak
immunostaining (n = 24). Reduced FosB protein expression in tumors correlated
with high grading (p = 0.005), negative estrogen and progesterone receptor status
(p < 0.001), and strong HER2/neu expression (p = 0.025). Comparison with
expression of seven cell-cycle regulators revealed an association of low/absent
FosB staining with p16MTS1 overexpression (p = 0.005). RT-PCR showed expression
of full-length FosB and the smaller splice variant FosB2 in most carcinomas and
cell lines with and without FosB protein expression, indicating that both
proteins are differentially regulated mainly at a post-transcriptional level. By 
sequence analysis of the coding region in four cell lines and 17 carcinomas we
detected a mutation in HBL-100 cells. Our results indicate that high FosB
expression might be necessary for normal proliferation and differentiation of
mammary epithelial cells, and reduced FosB protein levels might be involved in
dedifferentiation during breast tumorigenesis.

c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation of activator protein-1 underlies homologous
regulation of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor gene in alpha T3-1
cells.

Ellsworth BS(1), White BR, Burns AT, Cherrington BD, Otis AM, Clay CM.

Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State 
University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523, USA.

Reproductive function is dependent on the interaction between GnRH and its
cognate receptor found on gonadotrope cells of the anterior pituitary gland. GnRH
activation of the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) is a potent stimulus for increased
expression of multiple genes including the gene encoding the GnRHR itself. Thus, 
homologous regulation of the GnRHR is an important mechanism underlying
gonadotrope sensitivity to GnRH. Previously, we have found that GnRH induction of
GnRHR gene expression in alpha T3-1 cells is partially mediated by protein kinase
C activation of a canonical activator protein-1 (AP-1) element. In contrast,
protein kinase A and a cAMP response element-like element have been implicated in
mediating the GnRH response of the GnRHR gene using a heterologous cell model
(GGH(3)). Herein we find that selective removal of the canonical AP-1 site leads 
to a loss of GnRH regulation of the GnRHR promoter in transgenic mice. Thus, an
intact AP-1 element is necessary for GnRH responsiveness of the GnRHR gene both
in vitro and in vivo. Based on in vitro analyses, GnRH appeared to enhance the
interaction of JunD, FosB, and c-Fos at the GnRHR AP-1 element. Although enhanced
binding of cFos reflected an increase in gene expression, GnRH appeared to
regulate both FosB and JunD at a posttranslational level. Neither overexpression 
of a constitutively active Raf-kinase nor pharmacological blockade of
GnRH-induced ERK activation eliminated the GnRH response of the GnRHR promoter.
GnRH responsiveness was, however, lost in alpha T3-1 cells that stably express a 
dominant-negative c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) kinase, suggesting a critical
role for JNK in mediating GnRH regulation of the GnRHR gene. Consistent with this
possibility, we find that the ability of forskolin and membrane-permeable forms
of cAMP to inhibit the GnRH response of the GnRHR promoter is associated with a
loss of both JNK activation and GnRH-mediated recruitment of the primary
AP-1-binding components.

Time course of striatal DeltaFosB-like immunoreactivity and prodynorphin mRNA
levels after discontinuation of chronic dopaminomimetic treatment.

(1)Department of Physiological Sciences, Neurobiology Division, Lund University, 
Wallenberg Neuroscience Center, BMC A11, Sweden.

DeltaFosB-like proteins are particularly stable transcription factors that
accumulate in the brain in response to chronic perturbations. In this study we
have compared the time-course of striatal FosB/DeltaFosB-like immunoreactivity
and prodynorphin mRNA expression after discontinuation of chronic cocaine
treatment to intact rats and chronic L-DOPA treatment to unilaterally
6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned rats. The animals were killed between 3 h and
16 days after the last drug injection. In both treatment paradigms, the
drug-induced FosB/DeltaFosB immunoreactivity remained significantly elevated in
the caudate putamen even at the longest withdrawal period examined. The
concomitant upregulation of prodynorphin mRNA, a target of DeltaFosB, paralleled 
the time-course of DeltaFosB-like immunoreactivity in the 6-OHDA-lesion/L-DOPA
model, but was more transient in animals treated with cocaine. These results
suggest that DeltaFosB-like proteins have exceptional in vivo stability. In the
dopamine-denervated striatum, these proteins may exert sustained effects on the
expression of their target genes long after discontinuation of L-DOPA
pharmacotherapy.

Differential activation of AP-1 in human bladder epithelial cells by inorganic
and methylated arsenicals.

Drobná Z(1), Jaspers I, Thomas DJ, Stýblo M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North
Carolina 27599-7220, USA.

Chronic exposures to inorganic arsenic (iAs) have been linked to increased
incidences of various cancers, including cancer of the urinary bladder.
Mechanisms by which iAs promotes cancer may include stimulation of activator
protein-1 (AP-1) DNA binding through increased expression and/or phosphorylation 
of the AP-1 constituents. However, the role of methylated metabolites of iAs in
AP-1 activation has not been thoroughly examined. In this study, we show that
short-time exposures to 0.1-5 microM arsenite (iAsIII) or the methylated
trivalent arsenicals methylarsine oxide (MAsIIIO), or iododimethylarsine
(DMAsIIII) induce phosphorylation of c-Jun and increase AP-1 DNA binding activity
in human bladder epithelial cells. DMAsIIII and especially MAsIIIO are
considerably more potent than iAsIII as inducers of c-Jun phosphorylation and
AP-1 activation. Phosphorylated c-Jun, JunB, JunD, and Fra-1, but not c-Fos,
FosB, or ATF-2, are detected in the AP-1-DNA binding complex in cells exposed to 
trivalent arsenicals. In cells transiently transfected with an AP-1-dependent
promoter-reporter construct, MAsIIIO was more potent than iAsIII in inducing the 
AP-1-dependent gene transcription. Exposures to trivalent arsenicals induce
phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), but not c-Jun
N-terminal kinases or p38 kinases. These results indicate that an ERK-dependent
signal transduction pathway is at least partially responsible for c-Jun
phosphorylation and AP-1 activation in UROtsa cells exposed to inorganic or
methylated trivalent arsenicals.

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between two GFP variants is a
powerful technique to describe protein-protein interaction in a biological
system. However, it has a limitation that the two variants tethered to the
respective proteins have to be in sufficient proximity upon binding, which is
often difficult to attain by simple N- or C-terminal fusions. Here we describe a 
novel method to significantly enhance FRET between GFP variant-tagged proteins
with the use of leucine zippers. For the homogeneous sandwich immunoassay of a
high molecular weight antigen human serum albumin (HSA), two separate
single-chain Fvs recognizing distant epitopes of HSA were respectively fused with
fluorescence donor ECFP or acceptor EYFP, and FRET between the two was analyzed
by fluorescence spectrometry. Because these two proteins did not give any
detectable FRET uponantigen addition, we tethered each protein with a leucine
zipper motif (c-Jun or FosB) at the C-terminus to help the neighborhood of the
GFP variants. Upon antigen addition, the new pairs showed significant
antigen-dependent FRET. By exchanging the binding domains, the method will find a
range of applications for the assay of other proteins and their interactions in
vitro or in vivo.

Extracellular signal-regulated kinase transmits palytoxin-stimulated signals
leading to altered gene expression in mouse keratinocytes.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Envirommental and Occupational Health, School of Public Health,
University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.

We have been probing the molecular mechanisms of tumor promoters that stimulate
distinct initial signals to define critical downstream biochemical events in
carcinogenesis. The action of the novel skin tumor promoter palytoxin on
signaling and gene expression in keratinocytes, the primary target cells of tumor
promoters, was therefore investigated. Palytoxin stimulated an increase in mRNA
for matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), an enzyme implicated in carcinogenesis,
in a keratinocyte cell line derived from initiated mouse skin (308). Palytoxin
stimulated an increase in c-Fos binding to the activator protein-1 (AP-1) site
present in the promoter of the mouse MMP-13 gene. This effect was specific
because palytoxin had little effect on c-Jun, JunB, JunD, FosB, Fra-1, or Fra-2
binding or on overall levels of transcription factor binding. The increase in
c-Fos binding corresponded to a palytoxin-stimulated increase in c-Fos protein
levels. Palytoxin stimulated the activation of the mitogen-activated protein
kinases (MAPKs) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal
kinase, and p38. The MAPK kinase inhibitor PD 98059 blocked palytoxin-stimulated 
ERK activation. PD 98059 also blocked the palytoxin-stimulated increases in c-Fos
protein levels, c-Fos binding to the AP-1 site, and MMP-13 mRNA. These studies
identify important differences between palytoxin-stimulated signaling in
keratinocytes derived from initiated mouse skin, the biologically relevant cell
type, and other cell lines. Specifically, our data suggest that, in keratinocytes
derived from initiated mouse skin, ERK plays an important role in transmitting
palytoxin-stimulated signals to three downstream targets that are likely to
affect carcinogenesis: c-Fos, AP-1, and MMP-13.

Aberrant cell proliferation and differentiation after toxic injury to airway
epithelium can lead to the development of various lung diseases including cancer.
The activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor, composed of mainly Jun-Jun
and Jun-Fos protein dimers, acts as an environmental biosensor to various
external toxic stimuli and regulates gene expression involved in various
biological processes. Gene disruption studies indicate that the AP-1 family
members c-jun, junB, and fra1 are essential for embryonic development, whereas
junD, c-fos, and fosB are required for normal postnatal growth. However, broad or
target-specific transgenic overexpression of the some of these proteins gives
very distinct phenotype(s), including tumor formation. This implies that,
although they are required for normal cellular processes, their abnormal
activation after toxic injury can lead to the pathogenesis of the lung disease.
Consistent with this view, various environmental toxicants and carcinogens
differentially regulate Jun and Fos expression in cells of the lung both in vivo 
and in vitro. Moreover, Jun and Fos proteins distinctly bind to the promoter
regions of a wide variety of genes to differentially regulate their expression in
epithelial injury, repair, and differentiation. Importantly, lung tumors induced 
by various carcinogens display a sustained expression of certain AP-1 family
members. Therefore a better understanding of the mechanisms of regulation and
functional role(s), as well as identification of target genes of members of the
AP-1 family in airway epithelial cells, will provide additional insight into
toxicant-induced lung diseases. These studies might offer a unique opportunity to
use AP-1 family members and transactivation as potential diagnostic markers or
drug targets for early detection and/or prevention of various lung diseases.

The increased bone mass in deltaFosB transgenic mice is independent of
circulating leptin levels.

Comment in
    Endocrinology. 2002 Nov;143(11):4161-4.

Transgenic mice overexpressing deltaFosB, a naturally occurring splice variant of
FosB, develop an osteosclerotic phenotype. The increased bone formation has been 
shown to be due, at least in part, to autonomous effects of deltaFosB isoforms on
cells of the osteoblast lineage. However, abdominal fat and marrow adipocytes are
also markedly decreased in deltaFosB mice, leading to low serum leptin levels.
Increased bone mass has been linked to the absence of leptin and leptin receptor 
signaling in ob/ob and db/db mice. Thus, in addition to affecting directly
osteoblastogenesis and bone formation, deltaFosB isoforms might increase bone
mass indirectly via a decrease in leptin. To test this hypothesis, we restored
normal circulating levels of leptin in deltaFosB mice via sc implanted osmotic
pumps. Complete histomorphometric analysis demonstrated that trabecular bone
volume as well as dynamic parameters of bone formation was unchanged by this
treatment in both deltaFosB transgenic mice and control littermates. This
demonstration that restoring circulating levels of leptin in deltaFosB transgenic
mice failed to rescue the bone phenotype further indicates that the marked
increase in bone formation is autonomous to the osteoblast lineage.

FOS and FOSB expression in the medial preoptic nucleus pars compacta of
maternally active C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice.

C57BL/6J and DBA/2J inbred mice differ in aspects of maternal behavior and in the
morphology of the medial preoptic nucleus (MPO), suggesting a possible
association. DBA/2J mice have a compact subnucleus in the MPO, the MPOpc, that is
sexually dimorphic and absent in C57BL/6J mice. To determine whether MPOpc cells 
are activated by maternal behavior, FOS and FOSB immunohistochemistry was
performed on brain sections of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mothers following the return
of their pups after a separation of 2 days. In both light and dark phases of the 
daily cycle, stimulation of DBA/2J mothers evoked an increase in FOS- and
FOSB-immunoreactivity in the MPOpc. Stimulated C57BL/6J mice, which lack the
MPOpc, did not show an increase in cellular activity in the corresponding MPO
region. Cells immediately lateral to the MPOpc were activated by pup stimulation,
in both strains. These results suggest that MPOpc cells are active during
maternal behavior, and that strain differences in maternal behavior are related
to anatomical differences in the MPO.

Transcription factors involved in the pathogenesis of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia
in a rat model of Parkinson's disease.

Angela.Cenci-Nilsson@mphy.lu.se

L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (abnormal involuntary movements) is one of the most
debilitating complications of chronic L-DOPA pharmacotherapy in Parkinson's
disease. It is generally agreed that dyskinesia arises as a consequence of
pulsatile dopamine-receptor stimulation in the brain, causing downstream changes 
in genes and proteins. Advance in our understanding of such changes is critically
dependent on the availability of suitable animal models. We have introduced a new
method to classify and rate L-DOPA-induced abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) 
in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned rats. This method allows us to dissect the
molecular correlates of a dyskinetic motor response to L-DOPA in this species.
One of the most prominent molecular changes underlying the development of
dyskinesia in the rat consists in the striatal induction of prodynorphin gene
expression by L-DOPA. This effect is mediated by FosB-related transcription
factors of 32-37 kDa, which are co-induced with prodynophin in striatal neurons
of the "direct pathway". Both AIM development and the associated upregulation of 
prodynorphin mRNA by L-DOPA are significantly inhibited by the intrastriatal
infusion of fosB antisense. Antisense-mediated knockdown of CREB (cyclic AMP
response-element binding proteins) has however no effect. Our results identify
fosB as a potential target for adjunctive antiparkinsonian therapies.

A functional activating protein 1 (AP-1) site regulates matrix metalloproteinase 
2 (MMP-2) transcription by cardiac cells through interactions with JunB-Fra1 and

Enhanced synthesis of a specific matrix metalloproteinase, MMP-2, has been
demonstrated in experimental models of ventricular failure and in cardiac
extracts from patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Cultured neonatal rat
cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes were used to analyse the determinants of MMP-2
synthesis, including the effects of hypoxia. Culture of rat cardiac fibroblasts
for 24 h in 1% oxygen enhanced MMP-2 synthesis by more than 5-fold and augmented 
the MMP-2 synthetic responses of these cells to endothelin-1, angiotensin II and 
interleukin 1beta. A series of MMP-2 promoter-luciferase constructs were used to 
map the specific enhancer element(s) that drive MMP-2 transcription in cardiac
cells. Deletion studies mapped a region of potent transactivating function within
the 91 bp region from -1433 to -1342 bp, the activity of which was increased by
hypoxia. Oligonucleotides from this region were cloned in front of a heterologous
simian-virus-40 (SV40) promoter and mapped the enhancer activity to a region
between -1410 and -1362 bp that included a potential activating protein 1
(AP-1)-binding sequence, C(-1394)CTGACCTCC. Site-specific mutagenesis of the core
TGAC sequence (indicated in bold) eliminated the transactivating activity within 
the -1410 to -1362 bp sequence. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs)
using the -1410 to -1362 bp oligonucleotide and rat cardiac fibroblast nuclear
extracts demonstrated specific nuclear-protein binding that was eliminated by
cold competitor oligonucleotide, but not by the AP-1-mutated oligonucleotide.
Antibody-supershift EMSAs of nuclear extracts from normoxic rat cardiac
fibroblasts demonstrated Fra1 and JunB binding to the -1410 to -1362 bp
oligonucleotide. Nuclear extracts isolated from hypoxic rat cardiac fibroblasts
contained Fra1, JunB and also included FosB. Co-transfection of cardiac
fibroblasts with Fra1-JunB and FosB-JunB expression plasmids led to significant
increases in transcriptional activity. These studies demonstrate that a
functional AP-1 site mediates MMP-2 transcription in cardiac cells through the
binding of distinctive Fra1-JunB and FosB-JunB heterodimers. The synthesis of
MMP-2 is widely considered, in contrast with many members of the MMP gene family,
to be independent of the AP-1 transcriptional complex. This report is the first
demonstration that defined members of the Fos and Jun transcription-factor
families specifically regulate this gene under conditions relevant to critical
pathophysiological processes.

The dopamine D1 receptor is a critical mediator for cocaine-induced gene
expression.

Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio 45267, USA.

The dopamine D1 receptor plays a major role in mediating behavioral responses to 
cocaine administration. The time course for the acquisition and the relative
stability for the expression of behavioral responses suggest the involvement of
enduring neuroadaptations in response to repeated cocaine exposure. Changes in
gene expression through the D1 receptors may accompany and mediate the
development of such neuroadaptations to repeated cocaine stimulation. To test
this possibility, we systematically compared the expression of the fos and Jun
family immediate early genes in the nucleus accumbens and caudoputamen in D1
receptor mutant and wild-type control mice after acute and repeated cocaine
exposure. Moreover, we compared the expression of three molecules that have been 
implicated in mediating the actions of cocaine, Galphaolf, beta-catenin and
brain-derived neurotrophic factor, in the two groups of mice before and after
cocaine administration. We found that there is a lack of induction of c-Fos,
FosB, Fra-2 and JunB by acute cocaine exposure, and of DeltaFosB by repeated
cocaine administration in both the NAc and CPu of D1 receptor mutant mice
compared with wild-type control mice. Moreover, the D1 receptor is differentially
required for mediating Galphaolf, beta-catenin and BDNF expression in the NAc and
CPu upon cocaine exposure. These results suggest that the D1 receptor is a
critical mediator for cocaine-induced expression of these genes.

Delta FosB regulates wheel running.

Werme M(1), Messer C, Olson L, Gilden L, Thorén P, Nestler EJ, Brené S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, S-171 77 Sweden.

DeltaFosB is a transcription factor that accumulates in a region-specific manner 
in the brain after chronic perturbations. For example, repeated administration of
drugs of abuse increases levels of DeltaFosB in the striatum. In the present
study, we analyzed the effect of spontaneous wheel running, as a model for a
natural rewarding behavior, on levels of DeltaFosB in striatal regions. Moreover,
mice that inducibly overexpress DeltaFosB in specific subpopulations of striatal 
neurons were used to study the possible role of DeltaFosB on running behavior.
Lewis rats given ad libitum access to running wheels for 30 d covered what would 
correspond to approximately 10 km/d and showed increased levels of DeltaFosB in
the nucleus accumbens compared with rats exposed to locked running wheels. Mice
that overexpress DeltaFosB selectively in striatal dynorphin-containing neurons
increased their daily running compared with control littermates, whereas mice
that overexpress DeltaFosB predominantly in striatal enkephalin-containing
neurons ran considerably less than controls. Data from the present study
demonstrate that like drugs of abuse, voluntary running increases levels of
DeltaFosB in brain reward pathways. Furthermore, overexpression of DeltaFosB in a
distinct striatal output neuronal population increases running behavior. Because 
previous work has shown that DeltaFosB overexpression within this same neuronal
population increases the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse, results of the
present study suggest that DeltaFosB may play a key role in controlling both
natural and drug-induced reward.

The mechanism of heme oxygenase-1 (ho-1) gene activation by arsenite was
examined. Arsenite-stimulated expression of a ho-1 promoter/luciferase chimera in
a dose-dependent manner in mouse hepatoma (Hepa) cells. Mutation analyses
identified the arsenite-responsive sequence as the stress-response element
(StRE), which resembles the binding sites for the AP-1 superfamily of
basic-leucine zipper factors. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, up to
seven specific StRE-protein complexes were routinely detected using extracts from
untreated Hepa cells whereas a single complex was typically observed after
treatment with arsenite. Antibody "supershift" experiments identified Nrf2, JunD,
and ATF3 in control complexes and the amount of these factors increased
significantly in the arsenite-induced complex. MafG, ATF2, FosB, and JunB were
also detected in the arsenite complex. Activation of a StRE-dependent luciferase 
gene by arsenite was inhibited to varying degrees by dominant-negative mutants of
Nrf2, MafK, c-Fos, and CREB but most strongly with the latter. Together, these
results implicate multiple basic-leucine zipper transcription factors in ho-1
gene activation by arsenite.

Characterization of an osteoblast-specific enhancer element in the CBFA1 gene.

(1)Departments of Molecular and Human Genetics and Medicine, Baylor College of
Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.

Cbfa1 is a critical regulator of cell differentiation expressed only in the
osteochondrogenic lineage. To define the molecular basis of this cell-specific
expression we analyzed the murine Cbfa1 promoter. Here we show that the first 976
bp of this promoter are specifically active in osteoblastic cells. Within this
region DNase I footprinting delineated a 40-bp area (CE1) protected differently
by nuclear extracts from osteoblastic cells and from non-osteoblastic cells. When
multimerized, CE1 conferred an osteoblast-specific activity to a heterologous
promoter in DNA transfection experiments; this enhancing ability was conserved
between mouse, rat, and human CE1 present in the respective Cbfa1 promoters. CE1 
site-specific mutagenesis determined that it binds NF1- and AP1-like activities. 
Further analyses revealed that the NF1 site acts as a repressor in
non-osteoblastic cells due to the binding of NF1-A, a NF1 isoform not expressed
in osteoblastic cells. In contrast, the AP1 site mediates an osteoblast-specific 
activation caused by the preferential binding of FosB to CE1 in osteoblastic
cells. In summary, this study identified an osteoblast-specific enhancer in the
Cbfa1 promoter whose activity is achieved by the combination of an inhibitory and
an activatory mechanism.

L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in the intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine model of
parkinson's disease: relation to motor and cellular parameters of nigrostriatal
function.

Neuroscience Center, Lund University, BMC A11, S-221 84, Lund, Sweden.

In order to assess the role of striatal dopamine (DA) afferents in L-DOPA-induced
dyskinesia, we have studied a large series of rats sustaining 2, 3, or 4
unilateral injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in the lateral striatum. This
type of lesion produced a dose-dependent depletion of DA fibers in the
caudate-putamen, which was most pronounced in the lateral aspects of this
structure. An additional group of rats was injected with 6-OHDA in the medial
forebrain bundle to obtain complete DA denervation on one side of the brain.
During a course of chronic L-DOPA treatment, rats with intrastriatal 6-OHDA
lesions developed abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs), which mapped onto
striatal domains exhibiting at least approximately 90% denervation, as judged by 
DA transporter autoradiography. The denervated areas showed local upregulation of
preproenkephalin and prodynorphin mRNA, and FosB-like immunoreactivity, which
were highly correlated with the rats' AIM scores. When compared to completely
DA-denervated animals, the rats with intrastriatal 6-OHDA lesions showed an
overall lower incidence, lower severity and different topographic distribution of
AIMs. The involvement of proximal limb and axial muscles in the abnormal
movements was proportional to the spreading of the lesion from lateral towards
medial aspects of the caudate-putamen. Locomotive AIMs were only seen in rats
with complete lesions, but not in any of the animals with intrastriatal 6-OHDA
(which showed > 5% DA fiber sparing in the medial striatum). Intrastriatally
6-OHDA-lesioned rats had a larger therapeutic window for L-DOPA than did rats
with complete bundle lesions, since they exhibited an overall lower
predisposition to dyskinesia but a similar degree of drug-induced motor
improvement in a test of forelimb stepping. Our results are the first to
demonstrate that selective and partial DA denervation in the sensorimotor part of
the striatum can confer cellular and behavioral supersensitivity to L-DOPA, and
that the phenomenology of L-DOPA-induced rat AIMs can be accounted for by the
topography of DA denervation within the caudate-putamen.

Serum response factor: discovery, biochemistry, biological roles and implications
for tissue injury healing.

Chai J(1), Tarnawski AS.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine/Gastroenterology, VA Long Beach Healthcare System, CA, 
USA.

Serum response factor (SRF) is a transcription factor, which binds to a serum
response element (SRE) associated with a variety of genes including immediate
early genes such as c-fos, fosB, junB, egr-1 and -2, neuronal genes such as nurr1
and nur77 and muscle genes such as actins and myosins. By regulating expression
of these genes, SRF controls cell growth and differentiation, neuronal
transmission as well as muscle development and function. SRF can be activated by 
a variety of agents, including serum, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA),
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), cytokines, 
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), agents that increase intracellular Ca2+, 
T-cell virus1 activator protein, hepatitis B virus activator proteins pX,
activated oncogenes and protooncogenes as well as extracellular stimuli such as
antioxidant and UV light. SRF itself is regulated by both cellular signal
transduction pathways and interaction with other transcription factors e.g. Sp1, 
ATF6 and myogenic regulatory factors. Its biological function is best elucidated 
for myocardium. Specific cardiac SRF transgenesis demonstrated that
overexpression of SRF caused hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in mouse and the mouse
died of heart failure within 6 months after birth. Other transgenic data
suggested that sufficient SRF was needed for embryogenesis and early development.
Since SRF is important regulator of numerous genes involved in cell growth and
differentiation, including muscle and neural components, SRF may also play a
crucial role in tissue injury and ulcer healing, e.g. healing of gastrointestinal
ulcers.

Repeated ventral tegmental area amphetamine administration alters dopamine D1
receptor signaling in the nucleus accumbens.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology Finch University of Health
Sciences/The Chicago Medical School, North Chicago, Illinois 60064, USA.

Neuroadaptations of the mesoaccumbens dopamine (DA) system likely underlie the
emergence of locomotor sensitization following the repeated intermittent systemic
administration of amphetamine (AMPH). In the nucleus accumbens (NAc), such
neuroadaptations include enhanced DA overflow in response to a subsequent AMPH
challenge as well as increased sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of D1 DA
receptor (D1R) activation and an altered profile of D1R-dependent induction of
immediate early genes (IEGs). Previous results indicate that AMPH acts in the
ventral tegmental area (VTA) to initiate those changes leading to sensitization
of the locomotor activity and NAc DA overflow produced by systemic administration
of this drug. These observations are intriguing, given that acute infusion of
AMPH into the VTA does not stimulate locomotor activity or, as we report
presently, increase extracellular NAc DA concentrations. Two experiments,
therefore, assessed the ability of repeated VTA AMPH to produce adaptations in
D1R signaling in the NAc. Rats were administered three bilateral VTA infusions of
saline or AMPH (2.5 microg/0.5 microl/side, one every third day). In the first
experiment, in vivo extracellular electrophysiological recordings revealed that
previous exposure to VTA AMPH enhanced the sensitivity of NAc neurons to the
inhibitory effects of iontophoretic application of the D1R agonist SKF 38393.
This effect was observed early (2-3 days) and at 1 month of withdrawal, but not
after 2 months. Similarly, in the second experiment it was found that the
D1R-dependent induction by AMPH of Fos, FosB, and JunB, but not NGFI-A, in the
NAc was enhanced in rats exposed 1 week earlier to repeated VTA AMPH. These
findings indicate that repeated VTA AMPH administration initiates relatively
long-lasting adaptations in D1R signaling in the NAc that may, together with
presynaptic adaptations affecting DA overflow, contribute to the expression of
locomotor sensitization by this drug.

Chronic antipsychotic drug treatment induces long-lasting expression of fos and
jun family genes and activator protein 1 complex in the rat prefrontal cortex.

Author information: 
(1)A.I. Virtanen Institute, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland.

We have characterized the effects of chronic clozapine and haloperidol treatments
on the expression of fos (c-fos, fosB, fra-2) and jun (c-jun, junB, junD) family 
genes in the rat forebrain. The effects of chronic (17d) clozapine and
haloperidol on mRNA expression were determined two hours, 24 hours, and six days 
after the last drug injection, and the DNA-binding activity of the activator
protein-1 (AP-1) complex was studied after washout periods of 24 hours and six
days. Chronic clozapine treatment with a 6 d washout period induced the
expression of several fos and jun family genes in cortical regions, including the
prefrontal cortex (PFC), and in the caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens.
Moreover, the DNA-binding activity of the AP-1 complex was greatly increased in
the anterior cingulate cortex-PFC in mobility shift assays already after 24 h,
and remained increased after a 6d washout period. Chronic administration of
haloperidol upregulated fos and jun family mRNA expression that was detectable 24
h and 6 d after cessation of the treatment mainly in the cortex. However, the
DNA-binding activity of the AP-1 complex was not altered in the anterior
cingulate cortex-PFC by chronic haloperidol administration at any of the time
points studied. Thus, chronic treatments with clozapine and haloperidol induce a 
long-lasting enhancement of fos and jun family transcription factors that
continues for several days after the cessation of the treatments in the cortex.
These lasting effects might represent events that are potentially involved in the
mechanisms of antipsychotic drug action.

Differential expression of activator protein-1 transcription factors in pregnant 
rat myometrium.

Mount Sinai Hospital, 600 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 1X5.

While the AP-1 (activator protein-1) genes c-fos and c-jun have been implicated
in the expression of myometrial genes associated with the onset of labor, there
are no data concerning the role of other members of this family of transcription 
factors. To address this issue, we defined the expression and hormonal regulation
of AP-1 genes in the rat myometrium during pregnancy and labor. Tissue was
collected on Days 12, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, and 23 (labor) and 1 day postpartum.
Expression of c-fos, fosB, fra-1, fra-2, and junB was low during early gestation,
with a 5- to 10-fold increase on Day 23 during labor, and returned to low levels 
1 day postpartum. In contrast, the levels of c-jun and junD remained relatively
constant throughout gestation. Administration of progesterone (P4; 16 mg/kg
s.c./day) beginning on Day 20 (to maintain elevated plasma P4 levels) prevented
the onset of labor and blocked the expected rise in c-fos, fosB, fra-1, fra-2,
and junB expression on Day 23. In contrast, administration of the progesterone
receptor antagonist RU486 (10 mg/kg s.c.) on Day 19 induced preterm labor and a
premature increase in mRNA levels of c-fos, fra-1, fra-2, and junB. In
unilaterally pregnant rats, stretch imposed by the growing fetus was found to
increase the expression of c-fos, fosB, fra-1, fra-2, and junB only in the gravid
horn on the day of labor. These data raise the possibility that AP-1
transcription factors integrate endocrine and mechanical signals, leading to
myometrial gene expression required for uterine remodeling and the initiation of 
labor.

Interleukin 17 (IL-17) induces collagenase-3 production in human osteoarthritic
chondrocytes via AP-1 dependent activation: differential activation of AP-1
members by IL-17 and IL-1beta.

l'Université de Montréal, Québec, Canada.

OBJECTIVE: In osteoarthritic (OA) synovial fluid, many proinflammatory cytokines 
coexist and stimulate chondrocytes. As interleukin 17 (IL-17) is a catabolic
cytokine, we explored its effects on collagenase-3 production. In a comparative
manner we identified IL-17 and IL-1beta induced transcription factors mediating
upregulation of this enzyme's production.
METHODS: Collagenase-3 levels were determined by ELISA. Transfection experiments 
of human OA chondrocytes were performed, with the plasmids -1599CAT and -133CAT
consisting of 1.6 kb and the first proximal 133 bp containing polyomavirus
enhancer A-3 (PEA-3), activating protein-1 (AP-1), and TATA box of the human
collagenase-3 promoter, respectively. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were 
done with the AP-1 and PEA-3 oligonucleotides derived from the human
collagenase-3 promoter sequence. Supershift assays were carried out with the
specific antibodies against the Jun and Fos proteins.
RESULTS: IL-17 induced collagenase-3 expression and synthesis, with an EC50 at 10
ng/ml. Transfection experiments with wild-type -1599CAT and -133CAT and their
mutated AP-1 or PEA-3 derivatives revealed that the AP-1 site was essential for
basal and proinflammatory cytokine induced collagenase-3 promoter activity,
whereas the PEA-3 motif exerted a cooperative effect. Of note, in OA
chondrocytes, IL-17 and IL-1beta induced collagenase-3 production through AP-1
occurred with differential protein complexes: IL-17 stimulation resulted in FosB 
activation, while IL-1beta stimulated c-Fos. Data showed a strong activation of
JunB only in cells showing a higher collagenase-3 basal level and low cytokine
(IL-17 and IL-1beta) inducibility, suggesting this transcription factor protein
acts as a negative regulator.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that IL-17 and IL-1beta induced collagenase-3
production in OA chondrocytes mainly through AP-1 mediated transcriptional
activity but with differential protein complexes, suggesting that some AP-1
proteins play a pivotal role in the different cytokine responses in terms of
collagenase-3 production. Our data might suggest that JunB protein plays a
rate-limiting step in cytokine induced collagenase-3 production in OA
chondrocytes.

Retinoic acid receptors inhibit AP1 activation by regulating extracellular
signal-regulated kinase and CBP recruitment to an AP1-responsive promoter.

Retinoids exhibit antineoplastic activities that may be linked to retinoid
receptor-mediated transrepression of activating protein 1 (AP1), a heterodimeric 
transcription factor composed of fos- and jun-related proteins. Here we show that
transcriptional activation of an AP1-regulated gene through the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway
(MAPK(ERK)) is characterized, in intact cells, by a switch from a fra2-junD dimer
to a junD-fosB dimer loading on its promoter and by simultaneous recruitment of
ERKs, CREB-binding protein (CBP), and RNA polymerase II. All-trans-retinoic acid 
(atRA) receptor (RAR) was tethered constitutively to the AP1 promoter. AP1
transrepression by retinoic acid was concomitant to glycogen synthase kinase 3
activation, negative regulation of junD hyperphosphorylation, and to decreased
RNA polymerase II recruitment. Under these conditions, fra1 loading to the AP1
response element was strongly increased. Importantly, CBP and ERKs were excluded 
from the promoter in the presence of atRA. AP1 transrepression by retinoids was
RAR and ligand dependent, but none of the functions required for RAR-mediated
transactivation was necessary for AP1 transrepression. These results indicate
that transrepressive effects of retinoids are mediated through a mechanism
unrelated to transcriptional activation, involving the RAR-dependent control of
transcription factors and cofactor assembly on AP1-regulated promoters.

MAP and src kinases control the induction of AP-1 members in response to changes 
in mechanical environment in osteoblastic cells.

The activating protein-1 (AP-1) complex plays a critical role in bone physiology,
including its response to strain. We studied gene expression and nuclear
translocation kinetics of the seven AP-1 members, after substrate deformation
(Flexcell) or simulated microgravity (Clinostat), in osteoblastic ROS17/2.8
cells. Gene expression and nuclear translocation of all the AP-1 members were
induced, under both conditions, with differences in their kinetics, except fosB
mRNA in the Clinostat. Downregulation of protein kinase C (PKC) and COX1/2 or
inhibition of ERK1/2, p38(MAPK) or src kinases had no major effect on AP-1 mRNA
expression in the Flexcell. In contrast, ERK1/2, p38(MAPK) and src kinases
treatment blocked nuclear translocation of almost all the AP-1 members in both
models, except Fra-1, JunD after deformation and Fra-1, JunB after clinorotation.
Thus, changes in the osteoblastic mechanical environment induced a dramatic
induction of most of the AP-1 members with specific kinetics and involved MAPK
and src kinase pathways, which differed whether the cells were stretched or
clinorotated.

FosB gene products trigger cell proliferation and morphological alteration with
an increased expression of a novel processed form of galectin-1 in the rat 3Y1

In this study, we established rat 3Y1 embryo cell lines expressing FosB and
DeltaFosB as fusion proteins (ER-FosB, ER-DeltaFosB) with the ligand-binding
domain of human estrogen receptor (ER). The binding of estrogen to the fusion
proteins resulted in their nuclear translocation. After estrogen administration, 
exponentially growing cells expressing ER-DeltaFosB, and to a lesser extent
ER-FosB, underwent morphological alteration from the flat fibroblastic shape to
an extended bipolar shape, and ceased proliferating. Such morphological
alteration was also induced in quiescent cells expressing ER-DeltaFosB and
ER-FosB after one round of cell division triggered by estrogen administration.
The cells expressing ER-DeltaFosB changed shape frequently, and the content of
F-actin in the cytoplasm detected by binding of Alexa 488-phalloidin
significantly decreased after the morphological alteration. By two-dimensional
gel electrophoresis analysis of cellular proteins from the cells expressing
ER-DeltaFosB, we identified several proteins whose expression either increased or
decreased after estrogen administration. Two of these proteins were identified
from their amino acid sequences as novel processed form of galectin-1.

PC12nnr5 cells expressing TrkA receptors undergo morphological but not
cholinergic phenotypic differentiation in response to nerve growth factor.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Physiology, University of Western Ontario, and The John R
Robarts Research Institute, London, Canada.

We investigated mechanisms underlying nerve growth factor-mediated morphological 
differentiation and expression of cholinergic neuronal phenotype. In PC12, but
not PC12nnr5 cells, nerve growth factor induces neurite-like outgrowths and
enhances cholinergic phenotype; stable expression of TrkA receptors in nnr5 cells
(called B5P cells) restores morphological differentiation but not expression of
choline acetyltransferase. Transfection with an AP-1 luciferase reporter gene
revealed that PC12 but not B5P cells expressed nerve growth factor-induced
functional AP-1 activity. RT-PCR analysis of nerve growth factor-mediated changes
in AP-1 transcription factors showed rapid increases in c-fos and junB mRNA in
PC12 and B5P cells, while increases in c-jun were small. Using DNA-protein gel
shift assays we determined that nerve growth factor stimulates AP-1 binding in
both PC12 and B5P cells, and identified c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2, c-Jun, JunB
and JunD in AP-1 complexes. In Fos/Jun functional luciferase reporter assays,
nerve growth factor stimulated phosphorylation of c-Fos in both PC12 and B5P
cells, but phosphorylation of c-Jun only in PC12, and not in B5P cells. These
data indicate that mechanisms relating to AP-1 transcription factor complexes
underlying nerve growth factor-mediated enhancement of cholinergic gene
expression may differ from those required for morphological differentiation.

Signal transductions induced by bone morphogenetic protein-2 and transforming
growth factor-beta in normal human osteoblastic cells.

University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.

Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) activates Ras/MAPK signaling in many
cell types. Because TGF-beta and BMP-2 exert similar effects, we examined if this
signaling is stimulated by both factors and analyzed the relationship between
this signaling and the Smads in osteoblasts. BMP-2 and TGF-beta stimulated Ras,
MAPK, and AP-1 activities. The DNA binding activities of c-Fos, FosB/Delta FosB, 
Fra-1, Fra-2, and JunB were up-regulated whereas JunD activity was decreased.
c-Fos, FosB/Delta FosB, and JunB were associated with Smad4. The stimulation of
AP-1 by BMP-2 and TGF-beta was dependent on Smad signaling, and anti-Smad4
antibody interfered with AP-1 activity. Thus, BMP-2 and TGF-beta activate both
Ras/MAPK/AP-1 and Smad signaling in osteoblasts with Smads modulating AP-1
activity. To determine the roles of MAPK in BMP-2 and TGF-beta function, we
analyzed the effect of ERK and p38 inhibitors on the regulation of bone matrix
protein expression and JunB and JunD levels by these two factors. ERK and p38
mediated TGF-beta suppression of osteocalcin and JunD as well as stimulation of
JunB. p38 was essential in BMP-2 up-regulation of type I collagen, fibronectin,
osteopontin, osteocalcin, and alkaline phosphatase activity whereas ERK mediated 
BMP-2 stimulation of fibronectin and osteopontin. Thus, ERK and p38
differentially mediate TGF-beta and BMP-2 function in osteoblasts.

repair.

We examined the spatial and temporal expression patterns of proteins and mRNAs of
the components of transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1) to examine the 
activation pattern of lens epithelial cells during lens wound repair following an
anterior capsular injury. One eye of adult Wistar rats (n = 106) were used. After
making a lens anterior capsule incision with a hypodermic needle, the affected
eye was enucleated 0 and 30 min, 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 15, 20, 24 hr after injury.
Forty six globes were processed for in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide
probes for c-fos, fosB, c-jun, junB and junD mRNAs, and 60 globes were
immunohistochemically analysed using anti-c-Fos and anti-c-Jun antibodies. Normal
lens epithelial cells expressed mRNA signals for junD, but not for c-fos, fosB,
c-jun, and junB. mRNAs for c-fos, fosB, c-jun, and junB were detected in the
whole lens epithelium from the vicinity to the wound to the equator from 30 min
to 8 hr post-injury with their peaks after 30 min to 1 hr, but were no longer
detected at 10 hr or later. Expression of c-fos mRNA in the equatorial lens cells
was more marked than that of c-jun mRNA. Immunohistochemistry showed that c-Fos
protein was expressed in the lens epithelial cells in both the anterior and
equatorial regions of the injured lens from 1 to 10 hr after injury, and was no
longer detected at 12 hr. C-Jun protein was detected only in the equatorial lens 
cells from 1 to 5 hr after injury, and was no longer detected at 8 hr. Lens
epithelial cells except those in the equatorial region did not express c-Jun
protein. These findings indicate that transcriptional activation of lens
epithelial cells is initiated in the very early phase after the lens injury, i.e.
30 min post-injury, suggesting that AP-1 may play important roles in regulating
lens cell behavior during lens wound repair in rats.

Altered composition of the AP-1 transcription factor in immortalized compared to 
normal proliferating cells.

Sheerin A(1), Thompson KS, Goyns MH.

(1)School of Sciences, University of Sunderland, Fleming Building, Wharncliffe
Street, Sunderland, SR1 3SD, UK.

We have investigated the expression of the AP-1 transcription factor proteins,
fos, fosB, fra1, fra2, jun, junB, junD, using Western blot analysis, in several
types of asynchronously proliferating cells. The latter included normal
fibroblasts, immortalized but not tumourigenic fibroblasts, and two immortalized 
tumour cell lines. All cells expressed fos, fra1 and jun proteins and none
expressed fosB. There were, however, interesting qualitative differences between 
the normal fibroblasts and the immortalized cells. Expression of fra2 was
difficult to detect in normal cells, but was very evident in all of the
immortalized cells. The normal cells only expressed a 44 kDa junB species,
whereas the immortalized cells expressed both this and another 34 kDa species.
All of the cells expressed the two junD proteins but the smaller 39 kDa species
was more prominent in the normal cells, whereas the larger 44 kDa protein was
more prominent in the immortalized cells. These data indicate that immortalized
cells are not simply cells in which the ageing process has been prevented or
reversed, but instead exhibit additional characteristics to those associated with
young normal cells.

Activation of the Wnt pathway interferes with serum response element-driven
transcription of immediate early genes.

Tice DA(1), Soloviev I, Polakis P.

(1)Department of Molecular Oncology, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco,
California 94080, USA.

Mutational activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is a common early event in
colorectal tumorigenesis, and the identification of target genes regulated by
this pathway will provide a better understanding of tumor progression. Gene
expression profiling on oligonucleotide microarrays revealed reduced expression
of the immediate early genes fos and fosB following stimulation of cells by
Wnt-1. Further analysis demonstrated that serum or
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate activation of several immediate early genes 
including fos, fosB, junB, and egr1 was inhibited by Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling
inhibited transcriptional activation driven by the serum response element without
altering the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascade or
ternary complex formation at the fos serum response element promoter. The
Wnt-mediated repression of c-Fos, FosB, and JunB expression was consistent with a
decrease in their binding to an AP-1 promoter element and decreased target gene
transcription. The expression of fos, fosB, junB, and egr1 was also repressed in 
human colon tumors relative to patient matched normal tissue. By contrast, the
fos family member fra-1 was up-regulated in the human colon tumors, suggesting a 
compensatory mechanism for the reduction in fos and fosB expression. The results 
indicate that Wnt signaling can repress the expression of certain immediate early
genes, and that this effect is consistent with changes in gene expression
observed in human colorectal tumors.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase is required for bryostatin 1-induced
differentiation of the human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line Reh.

(1)Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Karmanos
Cancer Institute at Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201,
USA.

Bryostatin 1 (bryo 1) is known to induce the differentiation and cell cycle
arrest of human lymphoid leukemia cells in vitro. The extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK), originally identified as a participant in
mitogenic signaling, has recently been implicated in the signaling of cellular
differentiation. To examine the role of the ERK/mitogen-activated protein (MAP)
kinase pathway in B-lymphoid cell differentiation of the Reh Acute Lymphoblastic 
Leukemia cell line, the effects of bryo 1 on ERK activation were determined. On
bryo 1 treatment, the activity of ERK2 (p42) rapidly increased, with ERK1 (p44)
protein levels remaining constant. p44/42 immunoprecipitates from lysates of bryo
1-treated cells had increased their ability to phosphorylate the transcription
factor Elk-1. Constitutive AP-1 activity was shown to be potentiated after bryo 1
treatment using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The protein composition of
the AP-1 transcription factor complex activated by bryo 1 was analyzed using
supershift analysis with specific antibodies against c-Fos, Fos B, c-Jun, Jun B, 
and Jun D proteins. Supershift analysis revealed that the bryo 1-induced AP-1
complex was composed predominantly of Fos B and Jun D. Therefore, we evaluated
the effects of inhibiting MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) on both DNA binding and cellular
differentiation. Treatment of Reh cells with 20 microM PD98059, a specific
inhibitor of MEK, inhibited bryo 1-induced ERK activity and DNA binding.
Furthermore, PD98059 blocked the bryo 1-induced differentiation of Reh cells, as 
assessed by a number of features associated with lymphoid differentiation,
including changes in morphology, cell growth arrest, attachment, and increased
expression of the leukocyte integrin CD11c. Moreover, transient transfection of
Reh cells with antisense MAP kinase oligonucleotides blocked bryo 1-induced
expression of CD11c. Our analysis also shows that CD11c's gene promoter activity 
is augmented by bryo 1. Therefore, we conclude that activation of the MEK/ERK
signaling pathway is necessary for bryo 1-induced differentiation of the pre-B
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia cell line Reh.

Jun, Fos and Krox in the thalamus after C-fiber stimulation:
coincident-input-dependent expression, expression across somatotopic boundaries, 
and nucleolar translocation.

Pearse DD(1), Bushell G, Leah JD.

Author information: 
(1)School of Biomolecular and Biomedical Sciences, Griffith University, 4111,
Nathan, Australia.

Expression of the inducible transcription factors Jun, Fos and Krox is commonly
used to map neurons in the brain that are activated by sensory inputs. However,
some neurons known to be electrically excited by such inputs do not always
express these factors. In particular, stimulation of hindlimb sensory nerve
C-fibers induces expression of c-Fos in the medial thalamus (the mediodorsal,
intermediodorsal, centrolateral and centromedial), but not in the lateral
thalamus (the ventroposterolateral, ventroposteromedial and posterior group). We 
hypothesized that c-Fos expression might only occur in these lateral areas after 
more complex stimulation patterns, or that only other transcription factors can
be induced in these areas by such stimuli. Thus we examined the effects of
single, repeated and coincident C-fiber inputs on expression of six inducible
transcription factors in the medial, lateral and reticular thalamus of the rat. A
weak C-fiber input caused by noxious mechanical stimulation of the skin of one
hindpaw did not induce expression of c-Fos, FosB, Krox-20 or Krox-24; but it did 
reduce the basal expressions of c-Jun and JunD in both the medial and lateral
areas. An intense input produced by electrical stimulation of all the C-fibers in
one sciatic nerve also failed to induce expression of c-Fos, FosB, Krox-20 or
Krox-24 in the medial or lateral areas. However, in the medial thalamus it
increased c-Jun and reduced the basal expression of JunD, whereas in the lateral 
thalamus it had no effect on c-Jun but again reduced the basal expression of
JunD. With repeated stimulation, i.e. when the noxious stimulus was applied to
the contralateral hindpaw 6 h after the sciatic stimulation, there was again no
induction of c-Fos, FosB or Krox-20 in the medial thalamus; but there was an
increase in c-Jun and Krox-24, and a decrease in JunD levels. In the lateral
thalamus the repeated stimulation again failed to induce c-Fos, but the
expressions of FosB, c-Jun and Krox-24 were increased, and that of JunD was again
reduced. With coincident stimulation, i.e. when a stimulus was applied to each
hindpaw simultaneously, c-Fos and Krox-24 remained absent; but there was a marked
induction of FosB and Krox-20, a strong repression of c-Jun, and no effect or a
reduction of the basal levels of JunD. This coincident stimulation also caused
FosB to appear in the nucleolus of many thalamic neurons. MK-801, but not L-NAME,
blocked all these changes. In summary, noxious stimulation affects the expression
of all transcription factors in the medial, lateral and reticular thalamus in a
complex manner depending upon the inducible transcription factor considered, the 
thalamic nucleus, and the stimulation paradigm. The expression of some
transcription factors uniquely after simultaneous inputs suggests they act as
coincidence detectors at the gene level.

Defective signaling in a subpopulation of CD4(+) T cells in the absence of
Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV.

Anderson KA(1), Means AR.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University Medical Center,
Durham, North Carolina 22710, USA.

Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV-deficient (CaMKIV(-/-)) mice have
been used to investigate the role of this enzyme in CD4(+) T cells. We identify a
functional defect in a subpopulation of CD4(+) T cells, characterized by a cell
surface marker profile usually found on memory phenotype CD4(+) T cells. Upon
T-cell receptor engagement, the mutant cells produce diminished levels of
interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, and gamma interferon protein and mRNA. The defect is 
secondary to an inability to phosphorylate CREB and to induce CREB-dependent
immediate-early genes, including c-jun, fosB, fra2, and junB, which are required 
for cytokine gene induction. In contrast, stimulated naive CD4(+) T cells from
CaMKIV(-/-) mice show normal CREB phosphorylation, induction of immediate-early
genes, and cytokine production. Thus, in addition to defining an important
signaling role for CaMKIV in a subpopulation of T cells, we identify differential
signaling requirements for cytokine production between naive T cells and T cells 
that express cell surface markers characteristic of the memory phenotype.

cAMP response element-binding protein is required for dopamine-dependent gene
expression in the intact but not the dopamine-denervated striatum.

Andersson M(1), Konradi C, Cenci MA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Physiological Sciences, Neurobiology Division, Lund University, 
Wallenberg Neuroscience Centre, 221 84 Lund, Sweden.

The cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is believed to play a pivotal
role in dopamine (DA) receptor-mediated nuclear signaling and neuroplasticity.
Here we demonstrate that the significance of CREB for gene expression depends on 
the experimental paradigm. We compared the role of CREB in two different but
related models: l-DOPA administration to unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned 
rats, and cocaine administration to neurologically intact animals. Antisense
technology was used to produce a local knockdown of CREB in the lateral
caudate-putamen, a region that mediates the dyskinetic or stereotypic
manifestations associated with l-DOPA or cocaine treatment, respectively. In
intact rats, CREB antisense reduced both basal and cocaine-induced expression of 
c-Fos, FosB/DeltaFosB, and prodynorphin mRNA. In the DA-denervated striatum, CREB
was not required for l-DOPA to induce these gene products, nor did CREB
contribute considerably to DNA binding activity at cAMP responsive elements
(CREs) and CRE-like enhancers. DeltaFosB-related proteins and JunD were the main 
contributors to both CRE and AP-1 DNA-protein complexes in l-DOPA-treated
animals. In behavioral studies, intrastriatal CREB knockdown caused enhanced
activity scores in intact control animals and exacerbated the dyskinetic effects 
of acute l-DOPA treatment in 6-OHDA-lesioned animals. These data demonstrate that
CREB is not required for the development of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in
hemiparkinsonian rats. Moreover, our results reveal an unexpected alteration of
nuclear signaling mechanisms in the parkinsonian striatum treated with l-DOPA,
where AP-1 transcription factors appear to supersede CREB in the activation of
CRE-containing genes.

Green tea polyphenol stimulates a Ras, MEKK1, MEK3, and p38 cascade to increase
activator protein 1 factor-dependent involucrin gene expression in normal human
keratinocytes.

Cleveland, Ohio 44106-4970, USA.

(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is an important bioactive constituent of
green tea that efficiently reduces epidermal cancer cell proliferation. This
inhibition is associated with a reduction in activator protein 1 (AP1)
transcription factor level and activity. However, its effects on AP1 function in 
normal epidermal cells have not been extensively explored. Our present studies
show that EGCG regulates normal keratinocyte function. To understand the
mechanism of action, we examined the effects of EGCG on AP1 factor activity, MAPK
signal transduction, and expression of the AP1 factor-regulated human involucrin 
(hINV) gene. EGCG increases hINV promoter activity in a concentration-dependent
manner that requires the presence of an intact hINV promoter AP1 factor binding
site. This response appears to be physiologic, as endogenous hINV gene expression
is also increased. Fra-1, Fra-2, FosB, JunB, JunD, c-Jun, and c-Fos levels are
increased by EGCG treatment, as is AP1 factor binding to hINV promoter AP1 site. 
Gel mobility shift studies show that this complex contains Fra-1 and JunD. Signal
transduction analysis indicates that the EGCG response requires Ras, MEKK1, MEK3,
and p38 kinases. Kinase assays and inhibitor studies suggest that p38delta is the
p38 isoform responsible for the regulation. These changes are also associated
with a cessation of cell proliferation and enhanced cornified envelope formation.
These studies show that in normal human keratinocytes EGCG markedly increases,
via a MAPK signaling mechanism, AP1 factor-associated responses.

Molecular basis for the contribution of the antioxidant responsive element to
cancer chemoprevention.

Hayes JD(1), McMahon M.

Author information:

of Dundee, Dundee DD1 9SY, Scotland, UK. hayes@icrf.icnet.uk

This article provides an overview of the mechanisms by which cancer
chemopreventive blocking agents increase the expression of detoxication and
antioxidant genes. These agents all appear capable of transcriptionally
activating a gene battery that includes NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, aldo-keto
reductases, glutathione S-transferases, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase,
glutathione synthetase and heme oxygenase. Gene induction occurs through the
antioxidant responsive element (ARE), a process that is dependent on the Nuclear 
Factor-Erythroid 2p45-related factors, Nrf1 and Nrf2. Under basal conditions,
these basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors are located in the
cytoplasm of the cell bound to Keap1, and upon challenge with inducing agents,
they are released from Keap1 and translocate to the nucleus. Within the nucleus, 
Nrf1 and Nrf2 are recruited to the ARE as heterodimers with either small Maf
proteins, FosB, c-Jun, JunD, activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) or ATF4.
The role of protein kinases in transducing chemical stress signals to the bZIP
factors that affect gene induction through the ARE is discussed.

Alterations in transcription factor binding at the IL-2 promoter region in

BACKGROUND: The mechanisms responsible for the induction of clonal anergy are not
well understood. We have utilized an in vitro model of human T cell anergy to
explore the perturbations in cell signaling at the level of interleukin (IL)-2
gene transcription and to define the contribution of other cytokines to this
effect.
METHODS: An in vitro model of clonal anergy was established by using CD4+ T
lymphocytes from healthy human donors. Cells were anergized by prestimulation
with an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) followed by restimulation 72 hr later 
with anti-CD3 mAb with or without anti-CD28.
RESULTS: CD4+ T cells, anergized with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3)
prestimulation, displayed a marked reduction in proliferation (P=0.0036) and IL-2
production (P<0.0001). Co-incubation with IL-10 reduced cellular proliferation in
OKT3/CD28 pretreated cells by 19% (P=NS) and reduced IL-2 production by 40%
(P=0.0024). Anergized T cells demonstrated a reduced binding activity of the AP-1
complex to the IL-2 promoter. Supershift experiments and Western blots confirmed 
that the binding of c-Fos, JunB, and JunD, but not of FosB, was reduced in
anergized cells. At the sis-inducible element (SIE)-binding region of the c-Fos
promoter, Stat3 binding was reduced.
CONCLUSIONS: T cell anergy, induced by prestimulation with OKT3, is characterized
by reduced proliferation and a profound decrease in IL-2 production. Anergy can
be prevented by co-incubation with anti-CD28 and partially re-established by
IL-10. Anergy is accompanied by a reduction in AP-1 binding to the IL-2 promoter,
with selective reduction in binding of c-Fos, JunB, and JunD. Defective binding
for Stat3 at the c-Fos promoter suggests an involvement of the Jak-Stat pathway.

treatment in a rat model of Parkinson's disease.

Current knowledge of the molecular changes induced by dopamine denervation and
subsequent treatment with L-DOPA is based on studies performed on relatively
acute and young animal models of parkinsonism. It is highly warranted to ask how 
well these models simulate the state of chronic denervation and sustained L-DOPA 
pharmacotherapy which are typical of advanced Parkinson's disease. This study
investigates the effects of time postdenervation and L-dopa treatment duration on
the striatal expression of opioid precursor mRNAs and FosB/DeltaFosB-related
proteins. Unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats were treated with
therapeutical doses of L-DOPA for one year (long-term group) or a few weeks
(short-term group). Age-matched lesioned rats received injections of vehicle or
bromocriptine, an antiparkinsonian compound which does not produce dyskinesia
when administered de novo. The lesion-induced up-regulation of preproenkephalin
mRNA expression persisted at more than one year postlesion, and was unaffected by
the pharmacological treatments applied. L-DOPA, but not bromocriptine, induced
high striatal levels of FosB/DeltaFosB immunoreactivity and prodynorphin mRNA,
and these did not differ between short-term and long-term L-DOPA-treated rats.
The present data provide the first demonstration that L-DOPA maintains high
striatal levels of fosB and prodynorphin gene expression during a prolonged
course of treatment, which simulates the clinical practice in Parkinson's disease
more closely than the short-treatment paradigms studied thus far.

Addiction can be viewed as a form of drug-induced neural plasticity. One of the
best established molecular mechanisms of addiction is the upregulation of the
cAMP second messenger pathway, which occurs in many neuronal cell types in
response to chronic administration of opiates or other drugs of abuse. This
upregulation and the resulting activation of the transcription factor CREB appear
to mediate aspects of tolerance and dependence. In contrast, induction of another
transcription factor, termed delta FosB, exerts the opposite effect and may
contribute to sensitized responses to drug exposure. Knowledge of these
mechanisms could lead to more effective treatments for addictive disorders.

Expression pattern of the AP-1 family in endometrial cancer: correlations with
cell cycle regulators.

Bamberger AM(1), Milde-Langosch K, Rössing E, Goemann C, Löning T.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Gynecopathology, Institute of Pathology, University Hospital
Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.

PURPOSE: To study the expression pattern and the role of the AP-1 (activating
protein-1) family of transcription factors in endometrial carcinogenesis.
METHODS: We performed Western blot experiments with specific antibodies for each 
of the AP-1 proteins (c-jun, junB, junD, c-fos, fosB, fra-1, fra-2) with 41
endometrial carcinomas. Expression levels of the AP-1 factors were correlated
with clinico-pathologic tumor parameters, steroid receptor status, Ki-67
expression and the expression levels of eight cell cycle regulatory proteins
(cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin B1, cdk2, cdk4, p16, p21, and Rb).
RESULTS: Of the seven AP-1 factors, three (c-fos, fra2, and junB) clearly showed 
higher expression levels in tumors when compared to matched normal endometrial
samples. These factors also correlated significantly with cell cycle promoters
(c-fos with cyclin E, cyclin B1, cdk2, and cdk4; fra-2 with cyclin B1; and junB
with cyclin D1). Furthermore, high c-fos expression correlated with low ER and PR
immunoreactivity and high grading (G3). On the other hand, correlations with
classic cell cycle inhibitors (Rb, p16, p21) have also been observed for all AP-1
factors except c-jun and junD.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the AP-1 family of transcription factors
is probably implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression and control in
endometrial carcinomas. In particular, c-fos might be an additional negative
prognostic factor and/or implicated in tumor progression in endometrial cancer.

The approach of gene-targeted animal models is likely the most important
experimental tool contributing to recent advances in skeletal biology. Modifying 
the expression of a gene in vivo, and the analysis of the consequences of the
mutation, are central to the understanding of gene function during development
and physiology, and therefore to our understanding of the gene's role in disease 
states. Researchers had been limited to animal models primarily involving
pharmaceutical manipulations and spontaneous mutations. With the advent of gene
targeting, however, animal models that impact our understanding of metabolic bone
disease have evolved dramatically. Interestingly, some genes that were expected
to yield dramatic phenotypes in bone, such as estrogen receptor-alpha or
osteopontin, proved to have subtle phenotypes, whereas other genes, such as
interleukin-5 or osteoprotegerin, were initially identified as having a role in
bone metabolism via the analysis of their phenotype after gene ablation or
overexpression. Particularly important has been the advance in knowledge of
osteoblast and osteoclast independent and dependent roles via the selective
targeting of genes and the consequent disruption of bone formation, bone
resorption, or both. Our understanding of interactions of the skeletal system
with other systems, ie, the vascular system and homeostatic controls of
adipogenesis, has evolved via animal models such as the matrix gla protein,
knock-out, and the targeted overexpression of Delta FosB. Challenging transgenic 
models such as the osteopontin-deficient mice with mediators of bone remodeling
like parathyroid hormone and mechanical stimuli and extending phenotype
characterization to mechanistic in vitro studies of primary bone cells is
providing additional insight into the mechanisms involved in pathologic states
and their potentials for therapeutic strategies. This review segregates
characterization of transgenic models based on the category of gene altered, eg, 
reproductive hormones, calcitropic hormones, growth factors and cytokines,
signaling molecules, extracellular matrix molecules and "other" genes. Models are
also segregated based on phenotypes that are primarily osteoclastic, osteoblastic
or mixed. As the technical ability to alter gene expression negatively or
positively and in a tissue-specific and temporal manner continues to evolve,
there are endless possibilities for generating genetically altered animal models 
with which to gain insight into metabolic bone diseases.

Transforming growth factor-beta induced collagenase-3 production in human
osteoarthritic chondrocytes is triggered by Smad proteins: cooperation between
activator protein-1 and PEA-3 binding sites.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the signaling pathways leading to transforming growth
factor-beta (TGF-beta) induced collagenase-3 production in human osteoarthritic
(OA) chondrocytes, as well as the transcription factors and their binding sites
involved in the transcriptional control of collagenase-3 gene.
METHODS: Identification of the TGF-beta signaling pathway was by Western
immunoblotting using specific antibodies for the phosphorylated forms of p44/42
and p38 MAPK, SAPK/JNK, and the Smad2 protein. Electromobility shift assays
(EMSA) were carried out for activator protein- (AP-1), polyomavirus enhancer A
(PEA-3), activin-response-element-like, Smad-binding-element-like, and TGF-beta
inhibitory element oligonucleotides. Supershift assays using antibodies to the
Jun, Fos, and Smad families of proteins were used for identification of
transcription factors. Chondrocyte transfections were also performed using the
-133CAT collagenase-3 promoter plasmid (containing PEA-3, AP-1, and TATA sites)
and mutated AP-1 and PEA-3 sites.
RESULTS: The primary target of TGF-beta induced collagenase-3 in OA chondrocytes 
was the Smad2 protein, with significant phosphorylation within 5 min. Contrasting
with the Smad2, the untreated OA chondrocytes already had detectable levels of
the phosphorylated forms of p38 and p44/42 MAPK. Of the oligonucleotides tested, 
EMSA revealed that TGF-beta treated OA chondrocyte proteins bound only to the
AP-1 and PEA-3. Supershifts with the AP-1 oligonucleotide showed the presence of 
the Jun (c-Jun, JunB, JunD) and Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2) proteins in the
untreated and TGF-beta treated OA chondrocytes, whereas only Smad proteins
(Smad2, 3, 4) were present in the AP-1 binding proteins from the TGF-beta treated
chondrocytes. The AP-1 mutation decreased both basal (95%) and TGF-beta induced
(99%) collagenase-3 production, whereas the PEA-3 mutation decreased the basal
(15%) but more significantly (50%) the TGF-beta induced transcription.
CONCLUSION: Smad proteins are the main cytoplasmic signaling pathways in TGF-beta
stimulated collagenase-3 in OA chondrocytes. The AP-1 site appears critical for
upregulation of collagenase-3 production, but TGF-beta stimulation requires both 
AP-1 and PEA-3 sites for optimal response.

Rapid effects of triiodothyronine on immediate-early gene expression in Schwann
cells.

In the peripheral nervous system, triiodothyronine (T3) plays an important role
in the development and regeneration of nerve fibers and in myelin formation.
However, the target genes of T3 in peripheral nerves remain to be identified. We 
investigated whether T3 activated genes of transcription factors in Schwann
cells. Expression of egr-1 (krox-24), egr-2 (krox-20), egr-3, c-jun, junB, c-fos,
fosB, fra-1, fra-2, and CREB genes was analyzed by reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in Schwann cells isolated from
neonatal rat sciatic nerves and in the cell lines MSC-80 (mouse Schwann cells),
NIH-3T3 (mouse fibroblasts), and CHO (Chinese hamster ovary cells). Some of these
transcription factors have been shown to be involved in Schwann cell
differentiation. T3 triggered a rapid (15-30 min), transient (1-2-h) and strong
(6- to 15-fold) stimulation of Egr-1, Egr-2, Egr-3, Jun B, c-Fos, and Fos B mRNA 
expression in Schwann cells. In contrast, expression of c-Jun, Fra-1, Fra-2, and 
CREB mRNA was not affected by T3. The stimulatory effects of T3 could be
abolished by adding actinomycin D. T3 triggered the same pattern of gene
stimulation in the mouse Schwann cell line MSC80, but not in the NIH-3T3 and CHO 
cell lines. Serum activated all the genes that responded to T3 and in addition
fra-1 and fra-2, but not c-jun and CREB. Immunoblotting showed that the increase 
in Egr-1 and c-Fos mRNA levels was accompanied by an increase in the
corresponding proteins. In addition, shifts of the protein bands indicated a
posttranslational modification of the two proteins. These effects of T3 are
likely to be mediated by the intracellular T3 receptor, as the D-isomer RT3 and
T0, which do not bind to T3 receptors, proved ineffective. The present data
suggested that T3 may regulate Schwann cell functions and differentiation by
transiently activating the expression of specific transcription factors.

Genetically modified mice have provided important insights into the biological
functions of the dimeric transcription factor complex AP-1. Extensive analyses of
mice and cells with genetically modified Fos or Jun proteins provide novel
insights into the physiological functions of AP-1 proteins. Using knock-out
strategies it was found that some components, such as c-Fos, FosB and JunD are
dispensable, whereas others, like c-Jun, JunB and Fra-1 are essential in
embryonic development and/or in the adult organism. Besides the specific roles of
AP-1 proteins in developmental processes, we are beginning to obtain a better
molecular understanding of the cell-context dependent function of AP-1 in cell
proliferation and apoptosis, in bone biology as well as in multistep
tumorigenesis.

Plasmin-induced expression of cytokines and tissue factor in human monocytes
involves AP-1 and IKKbeta-mediated NF-kappaB activation.

It was previously shown that plasmin activates human peripheral monocytes in
terms of lipid mediator release and chemotactic migration. Here it is
demonstrated that plasmin induces proinflammatory cytokine release and tissue
factor (TF) expression by monocytes. Plasmin 0.043 to 1.43 CTA U/mL, but not
active site-blocked plasmin, triggered concentration-dependent expression of mRNA
for interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-alpha), and TF with maximum responses after 4 hours. Plasmin-mediated mRNA
expression was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the lysine
analogue trans-4-(aminomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid (t-AMCA). Increases
in mRNA levels were followed by concentration- and time-dependent release of
IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha and by TF expression on monocyte surfaces.
Neither cytokines nor TF could be detected when monocytes were preincubated with 
actinomycin D or cycloheximide. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated
plasmin-induced activation of NF-kappaB; DNA-binding complexes were composed of
p50, p65, and c-Rel, as shown by supershift experiments. Nuclear translocation of
NF-kappaB/Rel proteins coincided with IkappaBalpha degradation. At variance with 
endotoxic lipopolysaccharide, plasmin elicited the rapid degradation of another
cytoplasmic NF-kappaB inhibitor, p105. Proteolysis of NF-kappaB inhibitors was
apparently due to transient activation of IkappaB kinase (IKK) beta that reached 
maximum activity at 1 hour after plasmin stimulation. In addition, AP-1 binding
was increased in plasmin-treated monocytes, with most complexes composed of JunD,
c-Fos, and FosB. These findings further substantiate the role of plasmin as a
proinflammatory activator of human monocytes and reveal an important new link
between the plasminogen-plasmin system and inflammation. (Blood.

during chronic osmotic stimulation.

The Fos family comprises Fos and several subtypes of Fos-related proteins (Fras) 
such as FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2, DeltaFosB, and chronic Fras. Changes in the
expression of Fos family proteins with time are not well elucidated, particularly
during chronic stimulation. In the present experiments, we investigated
quantitatively the time course changes in Fos, FosB and Fras immunoreactivity in 
the magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic nucleus (SON) during acute and
chronic osmotic stimulation. A small number of Fos- and FosB-positive neurons
were observed in the SON of control rats, while many Fras-positive neurons were
seen in control animals. Significant increases in the numbers of Fos-, FosB-, and
Fras-positive neurons were observed 2 h after acute osmotic stimulation by
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 3% NaCl solution. Although the number of
Fos-positive neurons returned to the control level 4 h after i.p. injection, a
significant number of FosB- and Fras-positive neurons were still observed 8 h
after i.p. injection. During chronic osmotic stimulation by giving 2% NaCl
solution for 2 and 5 days, a large number of Fos-positive neurons were observed, 
but the cessation of chronic osmotic stimulation by normal water drinking
immediately decreased the number of Fos-positive neurons to the control level
within 2 h. The number of FosB-positive neurons was increased with period of
chronic osmotic stimulation, and a significant number were observed 2-8 h after
the cessation of the stimulation. The number of Fras-positive neurons was also
significantly higher during chronic osmotic stimulation, and this number was
significantly high 2-8 h after the cessation of the stimulation. RT-PCR analysis 
demonstrated the persistent expression of c-fos mRNA in the SON during chronic
osmotic stimulation. These results suggest that c-fos mRNA and Fos protein are
constitutively elevated during chronic osmotic stimulation and the time course
changes in Fos are different from those seen in FosB and Fras.

Tissue-specific transgenic knockdown of Fos-related antigen 2 (Fra-2) expression 
mediated by dominant negative Fra-2.

Smith M(1), Burke Z, Humphries A, Wells T, Klein D, Carter D, Baler R.

Author information: 
(1)School of Bioscience, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.

Fos-related antigen 2 (Fra-2) is a member of the Fos family of immediate-early
genes, most of which are rapidly induced by second messengers. All members of
this family act by binding to AP-1 sites as heterodimeric complexes with other
proteins. However, each appears to have a distinct role. The role and biology of 
Fra-2 are less well understood than those of its relatives c-Fos, Fra-1, and
FosB; moreover, Fra-2 target genes remain largely unknown, as does the basis of
its selective effects on transcriptional activity. To pursue these issues, we
created a transgenic rat line (NATDNF2) in which a dominant negative fra-2 (DNF2)
gene is strongly expressed in the pineal gland; tissue selectivity was achieved
by putting the DNF2 gene under the control of the rat arylalkylamine
N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) regulatory region, which targets gene expression to a
very restricted set of tissues (pineal gland >> retina). Expression of AANAT is
normally turned on after the onset of darkness in the rat; as a result, pineal
DNF2 expression occurs only at night. This was associated with marked suppression
of the nocturnal increase in fra-2 mRNA and protein levels, indicating that DNF2 
expression inhibits downstream effects of Fra-2, including the maintenance of
high levels of fra-2 gene expression. Analysis of 1,190 genes in the NATDNF2
pineal gland, including the AANAT gene, identified two whose expression is
strongly linked to fra-2 expression: the genes encoding type II iodothyronine
deiodinase and nectadrin (CD24).

JunD regulates transcription of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 and 
interleukin-6 genes in activated hepatic stellate cells.

Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, United Kingdom.

Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) to a myofibroblast-like phenotype is 
the pivotal event in hepatic wound healing and fibrosis. Rat HSCs activated in
vitro express JunD, Fra2, and FosB as the predominant AP-1 DNA-binding proteins, 
and all three associate with an AP-1 sequence that is essential for activity of
the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) promoter. In this study, we
used expression vectors for wild-type, dominant-negative, and forced homodimeric 
(Jun/eb1 chimeric factors) forms of JunD and other Fos and Jun proteins to
determine the requirement for JunD in the transcriptional regulation of the
TIMP-1 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) genes. JunD activity was required for TIMP-1 gene
promoter activity, whereas overexpression of Fra2 or FosB caused a repression of 
promoter activity. The ability of homodimeric JunD/eb1 to elevate TIMP-1 promoter
activity supports a role for JunD homodimers as the major AP-1-dependent
transactivators of the TIMP-1 gene. IL-6 promoter activity was induced upon
activation of HSCs and also required JunD activity; however, expression of
JunD/eb1 homodimers resulted in transcriptional repression. Mutagenesis of the
IL-6 promoter showed that an AP-1 DNA-binding site previously reported to be an
activator of transcription in fibroblasts functions as a suppressor of promoter
activity in HSCs. We conclude that JunD activates IL-6 gene transcription as a
heterodimer and operates at an alternative DNA-binding site in the promoter. The 
relevance of these findings to events occurring in the injured liver was
addressed by showing that AP-1 DNA-binding complexes are induced during HSC
activation and contain JunD as the predominant Jun family protein. JunD is
therefore an important transcriptional regulator of genes responsive to Jun homo-
and heterodimers in activated HSCs.

Kindling of claustrum and insular cortex: comparison to perirhinal cortex in the 
rat.

XM, Corcoran ME.

The perirhinal cortex has recently been implicated in the kindling of limbic
generalized seizures. The following experiments in rats tested the selectivity of
the perirhinal cortex's epileptogenic properties by comparing its kindling
profile with those of the adjacent insular cortex, posterior (dorsolateral)
claustrum and amygdala. The first experiment examined the kindling and EEG
profiles, and found that both the claustrum and insular cortex demonstrated rapid
epileptogenic properties similar to the perirhinal cortex, including very rapid
kindling rates and short latencies to convulsion. Furthermore, electrical
stimulation of all three structures led to a two-phase progression through
stage-5 seizures which had characteristics of both neocortical and amygdaloid
kindling. In a second experiment rats were suspended in a harness to allow for
more detailed documentation of both forelimb and hindlimb convulsions. With this 
procedure we were able to detect subtle yet unique differences in convulsion
characteristics from each of the kindled sites and stage-5 seizure phases. Some
of these convulsive parameters were correlated with changes in FosB/DeltaFosB
protein and BDNF mRNA expression measured two hours after the last convulsion.
Overall, it appears that the perirhinal cortex is not unique in its property of
rapid epileptogenesis. Moreover, the posterior claustrum exhibited the fastest
kindling and most vigorous patterns of clonus, suggesting that it may be even
more intimately associated with the motor substrates responsible for limbic
seizure generalization than is the perirhinal cortex.

Differential in vitro degradation of particular Fos family members expressed by

Mice were injected with kainic acid (KA) at a convulsive dose, followed by
homogenization of the hippocampus in the presence of different protease and
phosphatase inhibitors, and subsequent preparation of nuclear and cytosolic
fractions. An intraperitoneal injection of KA resulted in marked expression of
particular Fos family members, including c-Fos, Fra-2, and Fos-B, but not Fra-1
proteins, in both fractions 2 to 18 h after administration. These fractions were 
individually incubated at 30 degrees C for 1 to 18 h for determination of in
vitro degradation. Similarly rapid degradation was seen with c-Fos protein
between nuclear fractions obtained 2 and 18 h after administration, while no
significant degradation was found for c-Fos protein in cytosolic fractions
obtained 2 h after administration during incubation. By contrast, in vitro
incubation led to rapid degradation of c-Fos protein in cytosolic fractions
obtained 18 h after administration. Degradation profiles were peculiar to each
member protein in nuclear and cytosolic fractions obtained 2 and 18 h after
administration. Dialysis prevented degradation of c-Fos protein in nuclear
fractions without markedly affecting that in cytosolic fractions in a manner
independent of the time after administration. The addition of inhibitors for
phosphatases, but not for proteases, accelerated the degradation of c-Fos protein
in nuclear fractions previously dialyzed. These results suggest that in vivo KA
signals may modulate heterologous machineries responsible for breakdown of each
Fos family member in a unique manner in nuclear fractions, rather than cytosolic 
fractions, of murine hippocampus.

Overexpression of JunB in undifferentiated malignant rat oral keratinocytes
enhances the malignant phenotype in vitro without altering cellular
differentiation.

Kingdom. max.robinson@bristol.ac.uk

Our study examined the expression of AP-1 family members in keratinocytes derived
from the rat-4NQO model of oral carcinogenesis in which extremes of epithelial
differentiation and tumour cell aggressiveness are evident. The constitutive
expression of JunB was diminished in the undifferentiated, more aggressive tumour
phenotype compared with the well-differentiated, less aggressive keratinocytes,
whereas the expression of other AP-1 family members (c-jun, junD, c-fos, fra1,
fra2 and fosB) was either very weak or variable. After transfection of the
undifferentiated keratinocytes with junB cDNA, clonal populations were isolated
that expressed similar levels of JunB protein as the well-differentiated cells.
Both untransfected and transfected cell lines were keratin negative and vimentin 
positive. Increased expression of JunB in the transfected cells resulted in
up-regulation of c-Jun and Fra1 and an enhanced AP-1 activity as demonstrated by 
transcriptional activation of the prototypic AP-1 dependent promoter, MMP-1. JunB
transfected cells grew more quickly than vector-only controls and were refractory
to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-beta1. Over-expression of JunB resulted
in the elevated expression of the AP-1 dependent proteinase, MMP-9, whereas the
expression of the AP-1 independent enzyme, MMP-2, was unaffected. JunB
transfected keratinocytes were highly invasive in an in vitro assay of tumour
cell invasion compared with vector controls. The results indicate that increased 
expression of JunB above baseline levels in undifferentiated rat keratinocytes
does not alter epithelial differentiation but enhances the malignant phenotype in
vitro, possibly by altering the dynamics of the AP-1 complex.

The frontal cortex (FrC) and cingulate cortex (CgC) are critical sites for normal
cognitive function, as well as cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Thus,
modulation of synaptic transmission within these cortical areas may, in part,
account for the therapeutic actions of antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol
and clozapine. FosB and DeltaFosB are immediate-early gene (IEG) products
sensitive to changes in response to chronic neuroleptic drug administration. We
quantitatively examine whether there are light microscopic regional and/or
laminar variations in FosB or DeltaFosB in the FrC or CgC of normal adult rats,
or animals receiving 6 months administration of either drinking water clozapine, 
or depot haloperidol. Only animals receiving chronic haloperidol developed
vacuous chewing movements, the equivalent of tardive dyskinesia in humans. In
control animals, the deep and superficial layers of the FrC showed a higher area 
density of FosB, but not DeltaFosB immunoreactive cells than the medial layers of
FrC or any of the CgC layers. In animals receiving clozapine, but not haloperidol
there was increase in the area density of FosB immunoreactive neurons in all FrC 
layers, but the major increase occurs in medial layers. These findings suggest
that FosB expression identifies those FrC neurons that are most active during
normal waking behaviors and are further activated following chronic
administration of atypical neuroleptics without motor side effects. The results
also indicate that the actions of clozapine are attributed in large part to
modulation of the output of frontal cortical pyramidal neurons residing in the
medial layers.

Studies of human addicts and behavioural studies in rodent models of addiction
indicate that key behavioural abnormalities associated with addiction are
extremely long lived. So, chronic drug exposure causes stable changes in the
brain at the molecular and cellular levels that underlie these behavioural
abnormalities. There has been considerable progress in identifying the mechanisms
that contribute to long-lived neural and behavioural plasticity related to
addiction, including drug-induced changes in gene transcription, in RNA and
protein processing, and in synaptic structure. Although the specific changes
identified so far are not sufficiently long lasting to account for the nearly
permanent changes in behaviour associated with addiction, recent work has pointed
to the types of mechanism that could be involved.

Jun, Fos and Krox in the hippocampus after noxious stimulation:
simultaneous-input-dependent expression and nuclear speckling.

Pearse D(1), Mirza A, Leah J.

Author information: 
(1)School of Biomedical and Biomolecular Sciences, Griffith University, Nathan,
Australia.

Stimulation of sensory C-fibres produces extensive expression of the Fos, Jun and
Krox families of inducible transcription factors (ITFs) in many nociceptive CNS
areas [28]. In the hippocampus, however, c-Fos is only weakly induced by such
stimulation, and expression of the other ITFs has not been studied. Here we
examine the effects of single, repeated and simultaneous C-fibre inputs on ITF
expressions in the rat hippocampus. A brief, strong electrical stimulation of
sciatic nerve C-fibres induced little or no expression of c-Fos or Krox-20. In
contrast, FosB was induced and continued to rise in all areas, whereas the basal 
expressions of c-Jun and Krox-24 were initially reduced but then returned during 
the subsequent 36 h. A weak noxious cutaneous stimulus applied to one hindpaw
induced only weak expressions of the ITFs. However, if the sciatic stimulation
was applied contralaterally and 6 h beforehand, this weak stimulus strongly
induced Krox-24, but not other ITFs, i.e. there was a potentiation of Krox-24
expression. When these two stimuli were applied simultaneously a few c-Fos
labelled cells did appear, and there was and an increased Krox-24 expression.
There was also a strong potentiation of FosB and a strong reduction in c-Jun
expression. This simultaneous stimulation was the only type of stimulation to
induce expression of Krox-20. Also after simultaneous stimulation the majority of
the nuclear labelling for FosB, but not of the other ITFs, had a speckled
appearance. MK-801 blocked these changes in ITF expressions, but it could also
cause the C-fibre stimulations to induce c-Fos and c-Jun in specific areas of the
hippocampus. Thus C-fibre stimulation does affect transcription factor activity
in the hippocampus; and the strong responses of some ITFs to simultaneous inputs 
points to their having a role as 'genetic coincidence detectors' in the
hippocampus.

We demonstrate that the Bacillus subtilis fosB(yndN) gene encodes a fosfomycin
resistance protein. Expression of fosB requires sigma(W), and both fosB and sigW 
mutants are fosfomycin sensitive. FosB is a metallothiol transferase related to
the FosA class of Mn(2+)-dependent glutathione transferases but with a preference
for Mg(2+) and L-cysteine as cofactors.

psychostimulants].

Repeated administration of psychostimulants like methamphetamine and cocaine
induce behavioral sensitization, which is recognized as an animal model for
dependence and psychoses. Many previous studies have proved two major cascades
play a crucial roles for molecular mechanisms underling sensitization. The first 
one is activation of D1 dopamine receptors by robust increase of dopamine
release, followed by activation of adenylyl cyclase, increase of cyclic AMP,
activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphorylation of proteins by PKA. The 
second one is activation of NMDA receptor by enhanced release of glutamine,
followed by increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration, formation of
Ca2+/calmodulin complex, and phosphorylation of several proteins such as
calcineurin, CaM-K II and nitric oxide synthase. Recent advanced findings on
sensitization mechanisms were reviewed from three different aspects: 1) Studies
using knockout mice offered quite amazing findings that D1DA-receptor-lacking
mice or dopamine-transporter-lacking mice can develop sensitization and
dependence, which were not consistent with the previously established hypotheses 
based on behavioral pharmacology. In addition, those data showed the important
roles of vesicular monoamine transporter 2, 5HT1B receptors and delta FosB. 2)
Research on neural-plasticity-related sensitization revealed the involvement of
several molecules such as tissue plasminogen activator, arc (activity-regulated, 
cytoskeleton-associated), synaptophysin and stathmin. Increased expression of
these genes may participate in the rearrangement of neural networks with
synaptogenesis and expansion of dendrites 3) Trials to discover
novel-genes-involved sensitization phenomenon using differential display or
subtraction cloning found some candidate genes, mrt-1, NAC-1 and CART. Although
in these areas are still in progress, accumulating findings will elucidate the
details of the molecular mechanism of behavioral sensitization and dependence.

Progesterone receptor isoforms, PR-B and PR-A, in breast cancer: correlations
with clinicopathologic tumor parameters and expression of AP-1 factors.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Pathology, Department of Gynecopathology, University Hospital
Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.

In the present study, we used Western blot analysis to determine the expression
of the progesterone receptor (PR) isoforms, PR-B and PR-A, in breast tumors (n = 
53), and correlated the expression patterns of the two isoforms with the
clinicopathological parameters of these tumors and with expression of the AP-1
family of transcription factors. Expression of the two PR isoforms correlated
significantly with each other, indicating that the expression of the two isoforms
is probably regulated in a correlated fashion. Expression of both isoforms
correlated significantly with expression of the estrogen receptor (ER).
Furthermore, expression of PR-B was found to correlate significantly with the
absence of ErbB2/neu. For the AP-1 factors, Fra-1 expression showed an inverse
correlation with PR-B expression. In contrast, expression of FosB correlated
significantly with expression of both isoforms, and the association was stronger 
with PR-B expression. An analysis of the ratio of expression of the two isoforms 
showed that most of the tumors expressed PR-A levels which were equal or higher
than the corresponding PR-B expression levels (together 94% of the analyzed
tumors) indicating that, in mammary carcinomas, a predominance of the PR-A
isoform over the PR-B isoform seems to be the case. While there was no
statistically significant correlation with age, staging and histological type,
expression of both isoforms correlated with a more differentiated phenotype
(G1/G2 grading). However, this association was stronger for PR-B. Also, a PR-A < 
or = PR-B expression level was associated with G1/G2 grading, while a PR-A > PR-B
expression level showed an association with a more undifferentiated phenotype (G3
grading). The expression level of the two PR isoforms might prove to be of
prognostic and/or predictive value, especially since the two isoforms have been
shown to be functionally different and to modulate the response of tumor cells to
progestins and antiprogestins differently.

FosB in rat striatum: normal regional distribution and enhanced expression after 
6-month haloperidol administration.

University, New York, New York 10021, USA. jjrodrig@mail.med.cornell.edu

Subcortical motor nuclei show differential expression of FosB immediate early
gene products and specifically deltaFosB after short (8, 19, or 21 days) chronic 
exposure to typical and atypical neuroleptics represented by haloperidol and
clozapine, respectively. We quantitatively examined whether there are light
microscopic regional variations in area density of FosB or the truncated
deltaFosB in several motor-related nuclei of adult rats receiving vehicle or long
chronic (6 months) administration of either depot haloperidol or clozapine in
their drinking water. In control animals the dorsomedial and ventromedial
caudate-putamen nucleus (CPN) had a significantly higher density of
FosB-immunoreactive cells than the dorsolateral and ventrolateral regions. The
nucleus accumbens (NAc) core also serving motor functions had a higher basal
expression than the limbic shell region in control animals. The mediolateral
gradient in area density of FosB-labeled cells was maintained in animals
receiving either haloperidol or clozapine. In animals receiving haloperidol, but 
not clozapine, however, there was a regionally selective increase in the area
density of only FosB-immunoreactive neurons in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral
CPN and in both the core and shell of the NAc. Only the animals receiving chronic
haloperidol showed vacuous chewing movements, the animal equivalent of tardive
dyskinesia in humans. Our results suggest that, whereas the medial striatal
neurons are activated under basal conditions, long chronic haloperidol induced
FosB expression more exclusively in the lateral CPN and NAc core, implicating
these regions specifically in the motor side effects of this drug.

Expression of inducible transcription factors (ITFs) c-Fos and FosB was
investigated during acquisition of alcohol drinking in C57BL/6J mice. A slight
but statistically significant increase in c-Fos expression was found in the
Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW) of animals consuming 2% ethanol/10% sucrose for the
first time. Stronger expression of c-Fos in EW was found in animals repeatedly
consuming ethanol-containing solutions. These findings underscore the potential
importance of EW in alcohol-related behaviors.

Serotonin-dependent collagenase transcription in myometrial cells requires
extended AP-1 site.

College, 47 New Scotland Avenue, Albany, New York 12208, USA.

Primary cultures of uterine smooth muscle cells from post-partum rats express
interstitial collagenase in response to serotonin and the serotonin-dependent
production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) [Wilcox, B.D., Dumin, J.A. and Jeffrey, J.J.
Serotonin regulation of interleukin-1 messenger RNA in rat uterine smooth muscle 
cells. Relationship to the production of interstitial collagenase J. Biol. Chem.,
269, (1994a), 29658]. Transient transfections of these cells indicate that rat
collagenase transcription is regulated via a proximal consensus AP-1 site within 
an extended palindrome. Mutation of either the AP-1 site or extended palindrome
(EP) decreases promoter activity to approximately 30% of the wild-type.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays reveal the binding of smooth muscle cell
nuclear proteins to the AP-1 EP. This binding is barely detectable after mutation
of the EP and is completely eliminated by mutation of the AP-1 heptamer.
Competition experiments demonstrate that binding to the AP-1 EP is specific and
of higher affinity than binding to oligonucleotides containing a mutated EP.
Binding to the AP-1 EP is higher when smooth muscle cells are cultured in the
presence of serotonin than in its absence. Although IL-1 is required for
collagenase transcription, binding to the AP-1 EP appears to be IL-1-independent.
FosB, Fra-2, c-Jun, JunB and, most abundantly, JunD bind the AP-1 EP in the
absence and presence of serotonin. In contrast, Fra-1 expression and binding are 
serotonin-dependent suggesting that the activation of Fra-1 may be a key
component of collagenase transcriptional activation.

In vivo comparison of activated protein-1 gene activation in response to human
parathyroid hormone (hPTH)(1-34) and hPTH(1-84) in the distal femur metaphyses of
young mice.

Intermittent parathyroid hormone (PTH) treatment increases bone mass in humans
and animals. Although intact human PTH has 84 amino acids, the N-terminal 31 to
38 amino acids are sufficient for bone anabolic activity in vivo. Prior studies
have evaluated hPTH(1-34) and hPTH(1-84) with respect to bone mass increase and
quality, but there have been no in vivo comparisons of dose-dependent molecular
responses. After confirming that young male BALB/c mice respond to daily PTH with
increased bone mass, we profiled the steady-state mRNA levels of activating
protein-1 (AP-1) genes regulated by hPTH(1-34) and hPTH(1-84) at doses ranging
from 0 to 19.4 nmol/kg in the distal femur metaphyses. We selected AP-1 genes,
which include jun and fos, as they play a fundamental role mediating signals for 
proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in cells of different origins,
including bone, and are known to be regulated by PTH. Human PTH(1-34) and
hPTH(1-84) increased steady-state mRNA expression of c-jun, junB, c-fos, and
fra-2 in an equivalent dose- and time-dependent manner. Expression of fosB or
fra-1 was not detected with either peptide. When averaged across dose and time,
responses to hPTH(1-34) and hPTH(1-84) were not significantly different from each
other. Expression of c-jun, junB, and c-fos peaked 30 minutes after the injection
while fra-2 expression peaked 30 minutes later. All AP-1 genes stimulated by PTH 
returned to the levels of vehicle treated controls by 3 h after injection. The
expression level of junD, which was abundant in the distal metaphysis, was not
altered by either peptide. No change in magnitude was observed after 1, 3, or 7
days of once-daily subcutaneous treatment of either peptide. When individual
comparisons for each dose between peptides were made, the minimum effective dose 
necessary to stimulate a significant increase in c-fos and junB expression was
equivalent for both peptides. The minimum effective dose for hPTH(1-34) was at
least tenfold lower than hPTH(1-84) in stimulating c-jun and fra-2 expression.
Area under the curve for the highest dose (19.4 nmol/kg) of either peptide showed
no significant differences in the expression of any of the genes. In conclusion, 
in young mice given once-daily subcutaneous injections up to 7 days, hPTH(1-34)
and hPTH(1-84) induced equivalent responses by time and dose in the selected AP-1
genes. These data on molecular regulation in mouse bone confirm and extend prior 
data from rat studies showing equivalence on bone mass at equimolar doses.

Possible role for the FosB/JunD AP-1 transcription factor complex in
glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in cultured cerebellar granule cells.

Lidwell K(1), Griffiths R.

Author information: 
(1)School of Biology, University of St. Andrews, Fife, Scotland, United Kingdom.

The potent excitatory and neurotoxic actions of glutamate are known to influence 
the expression of a variety of genes, including those encoding the AP-1
transcription factor, which comprises proteins belonging to the Fos and Jun
families. However, the precise role of Fos- and Jun-like transcription factors in
these events remains elusive. Here we demonstrate, using primary cultures of
mouse brain cerebellar granule cells as an in vitro model system, a possible
involvement of the FosB/JunD heterodimer in excitotoxicity. Granule cells were
grown for either 2 or 7 days in vitro (DIV) before exposure to varying
concentrations (1-3000 microM) of the excitotoxin glutamate. In 7-DIV cells,
glutamate induced a concentration-dependent neuronal death, whereas, in 2-DIV
cells, no glutamate-induced neuronal damage was seen. We were particularly
interested in comparing the protein composition of the AP-1 transcription factor 
complex in cells exposed to excitotoxic and to nontoxic conditions. AP-1 DNA
binding activity was demonstrated by gel shift analysis in nuclear extracts
derived from 7-DIV cells following exposure to either a nontoxic (10 microM) or
an excitotoxic (250 microM) dose of glutamate and was similarly observed in
extracts of 2-DIV cells exposed to the same levels of glutamate. Gel supershift
analysis using antibodies against the different Fos and Jun family members
allowed differentiation between AP-1 DNA binding in nuclear extracts as a
function of both 1) viability status and 2) the stage of development. Of major
significance was the finding that FosB could be detected as a component of AP-1
in 7-DIV cells only under excitotoxic conditions, whereas c-Fos, Fra-2, and JunD 
proteins were detectable under both excitotoxic and nontoxic conditions in cells 
of this age. In 2-DIV cells (in which glutamate is nontoxic), AP-1 comprised
combinations of only Fra-1, Fra-2, c-Jun, and JunD. Because Fos family members
are unable to form homodimers, this finding raises the possibility that the
FosB/JunD heterodimer may have special significance in the mechanism of
excitotoxic neuronal death.

Localization of transcription factor AP-1 family proteins in ameloblast nuclei of
the rat incisor.

Nishikawa S(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, Tsurumi University School of Dental Medicine, Yokohama,
Japan. k01711@simail.ne.jp

We examined by immunocytochemistry the localization of the AP-1 family proteins
c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2 in rat incisor ameloblasts. Most
of the antibodies against AP-1 family proteins, except for c-Fos-specific
antibody, labeled ameloblast nuclei. The labeling intensity of the c-Jun, JunD,
and Fra-2 antibodies was stronger than that of JunB, FosB, and Fra-1. Antibody
reactivities of c-Jun, JunD, and Fra-2 were greatly enhanced during or after the 
transition zone. Furthermore, c-Jun antibodies labeled maturation ameloblasts in 
a cyclic pattern, which was correlated with ameloblast modulation. Disruption of 
ameloblast modulation by colchicine injection resulted in greatly decreased
reactivity of the c-Jun antibody in the ameloblast nuclei of the maturation zone.
Phospho-specific antibodies to c-Jun labeled ameloblast nuclei only weakly
throughout the secretion, transition, and maturation zones. These results suggest
that the stage-specific localization of AP-1 in ameloblasts is closely related to
tooth enamel formation.

Regulation of NMDA receptor subunits and nitric oxide synthase expression during 
cocaine withdrawal.

Loftis JM(1), Janowsky A.

Author information: 
(1)Research Service, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Oregon Health
Sciences University, Portland, Oregon 97201, USA.

The present study characterized the effects of withdrawal from cocaine on the
expression of NMDA receptor subunits (NR1, NR2B) and neuronal nitric oxide
synthase. FosB induction was measured to confirm that repeated cocaine exposure
influenced protein expression, as previously reported. Administration of cocaine 
followed by 24 h, 72 h, or 14 days of withdrawal resulted in alterations of NR1
and NR2B subunits and neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression as measured by
immunohistochemical labeling of rat brain sections. Optical density analyses
revealed significant up-regulation of NR1 in the ventral tegmental area at 72 h
and 14 days of withdrawal. Structure-specific and withdrawal time-dependent
alterations in NR2B expression were also found. After 24 h of withdrawal,
cocaine-induced decreases in NR2B expression were observed in the nucleus
accumbens shell, whereas increases in NR2B expression were found in medial
cortical areas. Two weeks of withdrawal from cocaine caused an approximately 50% 
increase in NR2B subunit expression in regions of the cortex, neostriatum, and
nucleus accumbens. In contrast, cocaine-induced up-regulation of neuronal nitric 
oxide synthase was transient and evident in cortical areas only at 24 h after the
last drug injection. The results suggest that region-specific changes in
interactions among proteins associated with the NMDA receptor complex may
underlie neuronal adaptations following repeated cocaine administration.

The transcription factor activator protein-1 is activated and interleukin-6
production is increased in interleukin-1beta-stimulated human enterocytes.

Hungness ES(1), Pritts TA, Luo GJ, Sun X, Penner CG, Hasselgren PO.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Surgery, University of Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.

The intestinal mucosa is an active participant in the inflammatory and metabolic 
response to sepsis, endotoxemia, and other critical illness. The genes for
various cytokines, e.g., interleukin 6 (IL-6), are regulated by multiple
transcription factors, including nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and activator
protein-1 (AP-1). In recent studies, treatment with IL-1beta of cultured Caco-2
cells, a human intestinal epithelial cell line, resulted in increased NF-kappaB
DNA binding. The effect of IL-1beta on AP-1 activity in the enterocyte and the
potential role of AP-1 in enterocyte IL-6 production are not known. We treated
Caco-2 cells with IL-1beta and determined AP-1 activity by electrophoretic
mobility shift assay (EMSA) and IL-6 production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA). Treatment of Caco-2 cells with IL-1beta resulted in a dose- and
time-dependent increase in AP-1 DNA binding. Supershift analysis suggests that
activated AP-1 contained c-Jun, JunD, c-Fos, FosB, and Fra1 subunits. When Caco-2
cells were transiently transfected with an AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid,
stimulation with IL-1beta resulted in increased luciferase activity, suggesting
that AP-1 DNA binding increased gene activation. Additional luciferase assays
were performed with a plasmid containing a wild-type or AP-1-mutated IL-6
promoter. Stimulation of these cells with IL-1beta gave rise to results
supporting the role of AP-1 in the regulation of IL-6 production. Geldanamycin,
which has been shown in studies to inhibit AP-1 activation, blocked
IL-1beta-induced AP-1 luciferase gene activation and IL-6 production. These
results suggest that the AP-1 family of transcription factors is activated by
IL-1beta in human enterocytes and that AP-1 may at least in part regulate IL-6
production in these cells.

Identifying the neurocircuitry involved in behavioral responses to drugs of abuse
is an important step towards understanding the mechanisms of drug addiction. The 
present study sought to distinguish brain regions involved in pharmacological
effects of cocaine and ethanol from secondary effects by administering these
drugs in the presence or absence of pentobarbital anesthesia. Changes in neuronal
activity were assessed by immunohistochemical analysis of expression of an
inducible transcription factor (ITF), c-Fos, in the brain of rats habituated to
repeated pentobarbital anesthesia or saline administration. Cocaine
administration (15 mg/kg, i.v.) in non-anesthetized animals produced a strong
induction of c-Fos in the striatum and large number of other brain areas. Ethanol
administration (2 g/kg, i.p.) induced c-Fos in a smaller number of characteristic
brain areas, including the central nucleus of amygdala and paraventricular
nucleus of hypothalamus. However, neither of these drugs was able to induce c-Fos
in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats (50 mg/kg, i.v.). The suppressive effects of
pentobarbital were not specific to c-Fos, such that pentobarbital also suppressed
expression of ITFs FosB and Egr1 in the striatum of cocaine-treated rats. On the 
other hand, pentobarbital by itself strongly induced c-Fos expression in the
lateral habenula of saline-, cocaine-, and ethanol-injected rats. It is not clear
whether the suppressive effects of anesthesia on ITF expression in other areas
are mediated by activation of lateral habenula, or are independent of this event.
Our data suggest that in the absence of conscious awareness of drug-associated
cues, cocaine and alcohol activate only a fraction of the neural elements engaged
in the unanesthetized state.

Members of the AP-1 family of transcription factors participate in the regulation
of bone cell proliferation and differentiation. We report here a potent
AP-1-related regulator of osteoblast function: DeltaFosB, a naturally occurring
truncated form of FosB that arises from alternative splicing of the fosB
transcript and is expressed in osteoblasts. Overexpression of DeltaFosB in
transgenic mice leads to increased bone formation throughout the skeleton and a
continuous post-developmental increase in bone mass, leading to osteosclerosis.
In contrast, DeltaFosB inhibits adipogenesis both in vivo and in vitro, and
downregulates the expression of early markers of adipocyte differentiation.
Because osteoblasts and adipocytes are thought to share a common precursor, it is
concluded that DeltaFosB transcriptionally regulates osteoblastogenesis, possibly
at the expense of adipogenesis.

Fos family members: regulation, structure and role in oncogenic transformation.

Tulchinsky E(1).

of Cancer Biology, Copenhagen. et@cancer.dk

The members of the Fos protein family might be subdivided in two groups,
according to their ability to transform rodent fibroblasts, transforming (c-Fos
and FosB) and non-transforming (Fra-1 and Fra-2) proteins. Members of these
groups are differently activated in response to external stimuli and possess
different structural features. Importantly, whilst c-Fos and FosB contain
multiple transactivation modules in their N- and C-terminal parts,
transactivation domains are absent in the non-transforming Fos proteins. As a
result, Fra-1 and Fra-2 though efficiently form dimers with the Jun proteins, are
weak transcriptional activators and inhibit the c-Fos-dependent activation in
transient transfection assay. The numerous experiments performed with the
different Fos mutant proteins with impaired transforming ability, as well as with
chimeric proteins revealed the importance of the transactivation function for
transformation. Fra-1 and Fra-2 proteins albeit ineffectively triggering
oncogenic transformation, are abundant in ras- and src-transformed murine and
chicken fibroblasts, in neoplastic thyroid cells and in highly malignant mouse
adenocarcinoma cells, which underwent mesenchymal transition. The abundance of
the non-transforming Fos proteins in these systems might be mediated by a
positive AP-l-dependent feedback mechanism, as well as by wnt signals.
Furthermore, the manipulation of the Fra-1 expression level in thyroid and
mammary tumor cells modulated the transcription of several tumor progression
markers and affected cell morphology and invasiveness. These recent data
demonstrate a novel function of non-transforming Fos proteins in the maintenance 
and progression of the transformed state. Interestingly, this function is
independent of the documented invalidity of the Fra-1 and Fra-2 proteins as
transcriptional activators in rodent fibroblasts.

Critical role of Smads and AP-1 complex in transforming growth factor-beta
-dependent apoptosis.

Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) induces not only cell growth
inhibition but also apoptosis in hepatocytes, myeloid cells, and epithelial
cells. Although Smad proteins are identified as key signal transducers in
TGF-beta1-dependent growth inhibition, their roles in the induction of apoptosis 
are unclear. We show here that both Smad proteins and AP-1 complex are involved
in TGF-beta1 signaling for apoptosis. Overexpression of a dominant-negative Smad3
mutant or Smad7, both of which impair Smad-mediated signal transduction, inhibits
TGF-beta1-dependent apoptosis. Only the JunD. FosB form of the AP-1 complex is
markedly activated during TGF-beta1-dependent apoptosis. FosB substantially
enhances Smad3. Smad4-dependent transcription, and dominant-negative FosB blocks 
TGF-beta1-dependent apoptosis but not growth inhibition. Expression of JunD.FosB 
enhances induction of apoptosis by TGF-beta1. Moreover, JunD.FosB binds to the
12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetate-responsive gene promoter element and recruits
Smad3.Smad4 to form a multicomponent complex. These results suggest that Smad
proteins and AP-1 complex synergize to mediate TGF-beta1-dependent apoptosis.

Chronic DeltaFosB expression and increased AP-1 transcription factor binding are 
associated with the long term plasticity changes in epilepsy.

Morris TA(1), Jafari N, DeLorenzo RJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Neurology, Medical College of Virginia at Virginia Commonwealth 
University, Richmond 23298, USA.

NMDA receptor activation during status epilepticus (SE) has previously been shown
to be required for epileptogenesis as well as the persistent upregulation of
serum response factor (SRF) in the in vivo pilocarpine model of epilepsy. SRF is 
established as a regulator of the FosB gene which expresses FosB and DeltaFosB
components of the AP-1 transcription factor complex. Therefore we investigated
whether DeltaFosB expression and AP-1 DNA binding were also persistently elevated
in pilocarpine-treated rats which chronically displayed spontaneous seizures.
Using hippocampal nuclear extracts, DeltaFosB expression and AP-1 DNA binding
were significantly elevated for up to one year in the epileptic animals. The
expression of other fos and jun proteins was not persistently altered in
epilepsy. Neuronal upregulation of DeltaFosB was correlated with regions of the
brain that were involved in seizure generation and propagation. The increase in
AP-1 DNA binding was shown to be dependent on NMDA receptor activation during SE.
Hippocampal DeltaFosB immunostaining was seen predominately in the neuronal
nuclei as opposed to other cell types. The data indicate that recurrent seizures 
which persistently occur in this model were not responsible for the increased
DeltaFosB expression. Chronic DeltaFosB expression in epilepsy may be playing a
role in the altered expression of other genes in this model and may be involved
in some of the neuronal plasticity changes associated with epileptogenesis.

Expression of cell cycle-regulatory proteins rb, p16/MTS1, p27/KIP1, p21/WAF1,
cyclin D1 and cyclin E in breast cancer: correlations with expression of
activating protein-1 family members.

The activating protein-1 (AP-1) complex is a mitogen-activated composite
transcription factor that leads to activation of various target genes and
enhanced proliferation of many cells after stimulation by TPA, EGF, serum, etc.
The molecular mechanism of cell-cycle activation by AP-1 complexes remains
unclear. Therefore, we studied protein expression of 6 cell cycle-regulatory
proteins (Rb, p16, p21, p27, cyclin D1, and cyclin E) in protein extracts from 53
breast cancer samples and 4 mammary cell lines and correlated the data with
expression of the 7 AP-1 family members (c-jun, junB, junD, c-fos, fosB, fra-1,
and fra-2) as determined in a previous study. After Western blot analysis, we
found significant associations between members of both groups: whereas c-jun was 
associated with Rb expression (p = 0.002), strong junD and c-fos expression
correlated with high cyclin E reactivity (p = 0.017 and p = 0.013, respectively).
Over-expression of fosB was found mainly in tumors with strong Rb (p = 0.013) and
weak p16 (p = 0.004) expression. Fra-1 expression was significantly associated
with p16 and cyclin E over-expression, whereas fra-2 results correlated with both
cyclin D1 and cyclin E. These results point to direct or indirect activation of
some cell cycle-regulatory proteins by AP-1 complexes. In addition, our data
suggest differential regulation of cell cycle-stimulating and -inhibiting factors
depending on the abundance of single AP-1 family members.

Molecular effects of the psychotropic NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 in the rat 
entorhinal cortex: increases in AP-1 DNA binding activity and expression of Fos
and Jun family members.

Noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists such as phencyclidine and MK-801 produce
psychotropic symptoms that closely resemble schizophrenic psychosis and induce
the expression of immediate early genes in limbic cortical areas. We are
concentrating on analyzing molecular and physiological effects that these drugs
produce in the entorhinal cortex and on the potential connection between these
effects and the psychotic symptoms. We show here that MK-801 increases the DNA
binding activity of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) complex in the entorhinal
cortex. We also observed increased expression of mRNAs for Fos and Jun
transcription factor family members c-Fos, FosB, Fra-2, and JunB, as well as Fos 
family proteins in the entorhinal cortex after MK-801 administration. This
suggests that the activated AP-1 complex consists of these transcription factors.
Genes regulated by the AP-1 complex in the entorhinal cortex might be involved in
the pathophysiology of psychotic behavior and are potential targets for new
antipsychotic drugs.

Effect of melatonin on the regulation of proenkephalin and prodynorphin mRNA
levels induced by kainic acid in the rat hippocampus.

Won JS(1), Song DK, Huh SO, Kim YH, Suh HW.

Author information:

Medicine, Hallym University, Republic of Korea.

The in vivo short-term effect of melatonin on kainic acid (KA)-induced
proenkephalin (proENK) or prodynorphin (proDYN) mRNA, and on AP-1 protein levels 
in the rat hippocampus, were studied. Melatonin (5 mg/kg) or saline was
administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to rats 30 min prior to and immediately
after i.p. injection of KA (10 mg/kg). Rats were sacrificed 1 and 3 h after KA
injection. The proENK and proDYN mRNA levels were significantly increased 3 h
after KA administration. The elevations of both proENK and proDYN mRNA levels
induced by KA were significantly inhibited by the preadministration with
melatonin. The increases of proENK and proDYN mRNA levels induced by KA were
well-correlated with the increases of c-Fos, Fra-2, FosB, c-Jun, and JunB protein
levels, which were significantly increased 3 h after KA administration and
effectively inhibited by administration with melatonin. In an electrophoretic
mobility shift assay, both AP-1 and ENKCRE-2 DNA binding activities were
increased by KA, which were also attenuated by the administration of melatonin.
In addition, cross-competition studies revealed that AP-1 or ENKCRE-2 DNA binding
activity was effectively reduced by the 50x unlabeled cross-competitor.
Therefore, these data suggest that melatonin has an inhibitory role in KA-induced
gene expression, such as proENK and proDYN mRNA expression, and this may be due
to a reduction of KA-induced AP-1 or ENKCRE-2 DNA binding activity.

Differential regulation of fos family genes in the ventrolateral and dorsomedial 
subdivisions of the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus.

Extensive studies have established that light regulates c-fos gene expression in 
the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the site of an endogenous circadian clock, but
relatively little is known about the expression of genes structurally related to 
c-fos, including fra-1, fra-2 and fosB. We analysed the photic and temporal
regulation of these genes at the messenger RNA and immunoreactive protein levels 
in rat suprachiasmatic nucleus, and we found different expression patterns after 
photic stimulation and depending on location in the ventrolateral or dorsomedial 
subdivisions. In the ventrolateral suprachiasmatic nucleus, c-fos, fra-2 and fosB
expression was stimulated after a subjective-night (but not subjective-day) light
pulse. Expression of the fra-2 gene was prolonged following photic stimulation,
with elevated messenger RNA and protein levels that appeared unchanged for at
least a few hours beyond the c-fos peak. Unlike c-fos and fra-2, the fosB gene
appeared to be expressed constitutively in the ventrolateral suprachiasmatic
nucleus throughout the circadian cycle; immunohistochemical analysis suggested
that delta FosB was the protein product accounting for this constitutive
expression, while FosB was induced by the subjective-night light pulse. In the
dorsomedial suprachiasmatic nucleus, c-fos and fra-2 expression exhibited an
endogenous circadian rhythm, with higher levels during the early subjective day, 
although the relative abundance was much lower than that measured after light
pulses in the ventrolateral suprachiasmatic nucleus. Double-label
immunohistochemistry suggested that some of the dorsomedial cells responsible for
the circadian expression of c-Fos also synthesized arginine vasopressin. No
evidence of suprachiasmatic nucleus fra-1 expression was found. In summary, fos
family genes exhibit differences in their specific expression patterns in the
suprachiasmatic nucleus, including their photic and circadian regulation in
separate cell populations in the ventrolateral and dorsomedial subdivisions. The 
data, in combination with our previous results [Takeuchi J. et al. (1993) Neuron 
11, 825-836], suggest that activator protein-1 binding sites on ventrolateral
suprachiasmatic nucleus target genes are constitutively occupied by
DeltaFosB/JunD complexes, and that c-Fos, Fra-2, FosB and JunB compete for
binding after photic stimulation. The differential regulation of fos family genes
in the ventrolateral and dorsomedial suprachiasmatic nucleus suggests that their 
circadian function(s) and downstream target(s) are likely to be cell specific.

Requirement of Ras/MAPK pathway activation by transforming growth factor beta for
transforming growth factor beta 1 production in a Smad-dependent pathway.

Yue J(1), Mulder KM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmacology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine,
Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033, USA.

Our previous results have shown that transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)
rapidly activates Ras, as well as both ERKs and SAPKs. In order to address the
biological significance of the activation of these pathways by TGFbeta, here we
examined the role of the Ras/MAPK pathways and the Smads in TGFbeta(3) induction 
of TGFbeta(1) expression in untransformed lung and intestinal epithelial cells.
Expression of either a dominant-negative mutant of Ras (RasN17) or a
dominant-negative mutant of MKK4 (DN MKK4), or addition of the MEK1 inhibitor
PD98059, inhibited the ability of TGFbeta(3) to induce AP-1 complex formation at 
the TGFbeta(1) promoter, and the subsequent induction of TGFbeta(1) mRNA. The
primary components present in this TGFbeta(3)-inducible AP-1 complex at the
TGFbeta(1) promoter were JunD and Fra-2, although c-Jun and FosB were also
involved. Furthermore, deletion of the AP-1 site in the TGFbeta(1) promoter or
addition of PD98059 inhibited the ability of TGFbeta(3) to stimulate TGFbeta(1)
promoter activity. Collectively, our data demonstrate that TGFbeta(3) induction
of TGFbeta(1) is mediated through a signaling cascade consisting of Ras, the
MAPKKs MKK4 and MEK1, the MAPKs SAPKs and ERKs, and the specific AP-1 proteins
Fra-2 and JunD. Although Smad3 and Smad4 were not detectable in
TGFbeta(3)-inducible AP-1 complexes at the TGFbeta(1) promoter, stable expression
of dominant-negative Smad3 could significantly inhibit the ability of TGFbeta(3) 
to stimulate TGFbeta(1) promoter activity. Transient expression of
dominant-negative Smad4 also inhibited the ability of TGFbeta(3) to transactivate
the TGFbeta(1) promoter. Thus, although the Ras/MAPK pathways are essential for
TGFbeta(3) induction of TGFbeta(1), Smads may only contribute to this biological 
response in an indirect manner.

Basic fibroblast growth factor stimulates collagenase-3 promoter activity in
osteoblasts through an activator protein-1-binding site.

Center, Hartford, Connecticut 06105, USA. svarghes@stfranciscare.org

Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) stimulates collagenase-3 synthesis in fetal
rat osteoblast-enriched (Ob) cells. In this study we examined the mechanism of
collagenase-3 regulation in Ob cells. bFGF at 0.6 nM or more increased the
transcriptional rate of collagenase-3 by 3- to 7-fold. bFGF at 0.6 nM increased
the activity of collagenase-3 promoter-luciferase reporter deletion constructs
from -721 to -53 nucleotides transiently transfected into Ob cells by 3- to
5-fold. The minimal bFGF response was retained within the -53 to +28 sequence.
Mutational analysis revealed that the bFGF effect was mediated through an
activator protein-1 (AP-1)-binding site located at -48 to -42 nucleotides in the 
promoter. bFGF stimulated the binding of nuclear factors to the collagenase AP-1 
site by 3- to 4-fold, as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays.
Supershift analysis of nuclear extracts revealed that bFGF stimulates the
occupancy of AP-1 site by c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, FosB, and Fra2. In
conclusion, bFGF increases collagenase-3 gene transcription, an effect mediated
through an AP-1 site, due to the induction or activation of Jun and Fos family
transcription factors. The stimulation of collagenase-3 synthesis by bFGF may be 
critical in mediating the actions of this growth factor in bone remodeling.

Requirement of an AP-1 site in the calcium response region of the involucrin
promoter.

Ng DC(1), Shafaee S, Lee D, Bikle DD.

Author information: 
(1)Endocrine Unit, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, University of California, San
Francisco, California 94121, USA.

Involucrin is a major protein of the cornified envelope of keratinocytes that
provides much of the structural integrity of the skin. The gene expression of
this differentiation marker is induced by elevated extracellular calcium in
cultured human keratinocytes. A 3.7-kilobase fragment of this gene contains the
necessary elements to drive a luciferase reporter in a calcium-dependent manner. 
We have sequenced the upstream region of the involucrin promoter and localized a 
calcium response element that contains an activating protein-1 (AP-1) site
(TGAGTCA). Mutation of this site abolished the promoter activation by calcium.
Compared with cells grown in 0.03 mm calcium, the binding activity of factors
within nuclear extracts from keratinocytes for this AP-1 site was enhanced 3-fold
in cells grown in 1.2 mm calcium. Immunoelectrophoretic mobility shift
(supershift) assays identified JunD, Fra1, and Fra2 as the major factors that
bind to the AP-1 element. Western analysis of the proteins in the nuclear
extracts showed that the levels of c-Jun, JunB, JunD, FosB, and Fra2 increased
and the levels of c-Fos and Fra1 decreased slightly with calcium treatment. The
effect of calcium on the involucrin promoter was enhanced synergistically by
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in a protein kinase-dependent manner. In
conclusion, calcium-regulated involucrin gene expression is mediated at least in 
part by AP-1 transcription factors.

Down-regulation of AP1 activities after polarization of vas deferens epithelial
cells correlates with androgen-induced gene expression.

M.

Author information:

Cedex, France.

Vas deferens epithelial cell subcultures were used to study the sequential
regulation of jun/fos proto-oncogene expression and AP1 activities during cell
proliferation, polarization and androgen-induced expression of a terminal
differentiation marker, i. e. the mvdp gene. Proliferation of epithelial cells is
associated with a high expression in the nucleus of most Jun and Fos
oncoproteins. After cell seeding on an extracellular matrix which allows
polarization and expression of the mvdp gene in response to androgens, AP1
protein accumulation is greatly altered and consists in a loss of JunB, Fra1,
FosB and a decrease in c-Fos, c-Jun and Fra2, while JunD remained at the same
level. This was correlated with a drop in AP1 binding activity as evaluated by
gel shift assay using either AP1 consensus sequence or AP1 binding sites of the
mvdp gene promoter region, and in AP1 transactivating activity, as estimated by
stable transfection experiments using an AP1 responsive promoter (TRE-TK-luc).
Androgens did not significantly influence AP1 activities. On the contrary,
stimulation of AP1 proteins by the tumor-promoting phorbol ester caused a
decrease in androgen-induced mvdp mRNA accumulation, and this effect was reversed
by staurosporine, a potent inhibitor of PKC. Our data suggest that a
down-regulation of AP1 activities induced by epithelial cell differentiation is a
prerequisite to androgen-induced mvdp gene expression. The high AP1 activities
observed during proliferative state or induced in TPA-treated polarized cells,
exert a repressive effect on androgen action.

Quinpirole attenuates the striatal immediate early gene expression, but not the
hyperactivity, induced by the serotonin agonist RU-24969.

Cook DF(1), Wirtshafter D.

Author information: 
(1)The University of Illinois at Chicago, Department of Psychology, 60607-7137,
USA.

Systemic administration of the mixed 5-HT(1A/1B) agonist RU-24969 has been shown 
to produce a dramatic increase in locomotor activity and to induce robust c-Fos
expression in the rat striatum. Previous studies have also shown that
pretreatment with the D2-like dopamine agonist quinpirole virtually abolishes
RU-24969-induced striatal c-Fos expression. The present study was undertaken to
determine whether the effects of RU-24969 on immediate early gene expression
extend to the additional Fos family transcription factors FosB and Fra-2.
Additionally, this study quantitatively examined the effect of quinpirole
pretreatment on the ability of RU-24969 to induce both locomotor hyperactivity
and striatal immediate early gene expression. RU-24969 alone produced elevations 
in locomotor activity and induced clear expression of c-Fos, FosB and Fra-2
throughout the entire striatal complex. Quinpirole pretreatment virtually
abolished RU-24969-induced expression of all three transcription factors, but did
not alter the elevated locomotor activity produced by RU-24969. These results
demonstrate that the effects of RU-24969 on locomotor activity can be dissociated
from its effects on immediate early gene expression within the striatum.

Rapid activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 and target gene expression in postischemic
rat intestine.

Yeh KY(1), Yeh M, Glass J, Granger DN.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center,
Shreveport, Louisiana 71130, USA.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The molecular mechanisms underlying intestinal mucosal
damage-repair processes induced by ischemia-reperfusion (IR) remain unknown. We
determined nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1)
activities and the expression of potential target genes relevant to damage-repair
events.
METHODS: Rat jejunal segment was subjected to ischemia for 30 minutes followed by
reperfusion for defined times. NF-kappaB and AP-1 activities; mucosal p105, p50, 
and inhibitor kappaB-alpha (IkappaB-alpha) levels; and c-fos, neurotensin, and
ferritin H expression were determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and
Western and Northern analyses, respectively.
RESULTS: NF-kappaB and AP-1 activities were significantly elevated from 1 to 12
hours after reperfusion. The activated NF-kappaB in the nuclear extract consisted
of solely p50 homodimers. Activation of p50 was associated with a decrease of
p105, generation of p50, and increased phosphorylation and degradation of
IkappaB-alpha. The activated AP-1 contained c-fos but not c-jun, fosB, and Fra-1.
Reperfusion induced a transient elevation of c-fos, prolonged increase of
neurotensin, and early reduction followed by recovery of ferritin H messenger
RNA.
CONCLUSIONS: The intestine shows organ-specific responses to IR, characterized by
prolonged NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation involving NF-kappaB p50 dimers and
excluding AP-1 c-jun protein. Degradation of the IkappaB-gamma component of p105 
and partial reduction IkappaB-alpha selectively activate p50/p50 dimers. Temporal
patterns of target gene expression reflect functional relevance to mucosal
damage-repair processes after IR.

Successive occupancy by immediate early transcriptional factors of the tyrosine
hydroxylase gene TRE and CRE sites in PACAP-stimulated PC12 pheochromocytoma
cells.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Clinical Pathology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University
of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.

We previously demonstrated that pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating
polypeptide (PACAP) coordinately upregulates the expression of the tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) genes by activating the
cyclic AMP (cAMP) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathways. In this study,
we examined the effects of PACAP on the expression of fos and jun immediate early
gene (IEG) families, expression of which can be up-regulated by both PKC and cAMP
signaling pathways, in rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 cells. PACAP potently 
stimulated the expression of c-fos, fosB junB and junD, but not c-jun mRNAs, at
doses of 0.1-10 nM, as revealed by Northern blot analysis. The effects of PACAP
on the expression of these mRNAs in PC12 cells was rapid (30-60 min) and
dose-dependent. PACAP administration induced maximum expression of c-fos, fosB
and junB mRNA after 60 min, and of junD mRNA after 8 h. Gel mobility shift assays
using synthetic DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to the TH 5'-flanking region
and nuclear extracts from PC12 cells demonstrated that PACAP enhanced formation
of the specific protein complexes which bind to the TPA-responsive element (TRE) 
and cAMP-responsive element (CRE), respectively. Gel shift and supershift
analyses showed that the TRE-binding factors and CRE-binding factors comprised
fosB, c-fos, junB, and junD, and CRE-binding protein (CREB) and junD,
respectively. JunB was dominant in the TRE-binding complexes at 4 h after
addition of PACAP, whereas both JunD and JunB were dominant at 12 h. These
results suggest that agonist occupancy of PACAP receptors activates
transcriptional factors (Fos/Jun families and CREB) that interact with the TRE
and CRE sites of the TH 5'-flanking region, contributing to transcriptional
activation of TH gene.

Fosl1 is a transcriptional target of c-Fos during osteoclast differentiation.

Matsuo K(1), Owens JM, Tonko M, Elliott C, Chambers TJ, Wagner EF.

Author information: 
(1)Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna, Austria.

Osteoclasts are bone-resorbing cells derived from haematopoietic precursors of
the monocyte-macrophage lineage. Mice lacking Fos (encoding c-Fos) develop
osteopetrosis due to an early differentiation block in the osteoclast lineage.
c-Fos is a component of the dimeric transcription factor activator protein-1
(Ap-1), which is composed mainly of Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1 and Fra-2) and Jun
proteins (c-Jun, JunB and JunD). Unlike Fra-1 (encoded by Fosl1), c-Fos contains 
transactivation domains required for oncogenesis and cellular transformation. The
mechanism by which c-Fos exerts its specific function in osteoclast
differentiation is not understood. Here we show by retroviral-gene transfer that 
all four Fos proteins, but not the Jun proteins, rescue the differentiation block
in vitro. Structure-function analysis demonstrated that the major
carboxy-terminal transactivation domains of c-Fos and FosB are dispensable and
that Fra-1 (which lacks transactivation domains) has the highest rescue activity.
Moreover, a transgene expressing Fra-1 rescues the osteopetrosis of c-Fos-mutant 
mice in vivo. The osteoclast differentiation factor Rankl (also known as TRANCE, 
ODF and OPGL; refs 8-11) induces transcription of Fosl1 in a c-Fos-dependent

Induction of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in the hippocampus by chronic
electroconvulsive seizures: role of [Delta]FosB.

The transcription factor DeltaFosB is induced in the hippocampus and other brain 
regions by repeated electroconvulsive seizures (ECS), an effective antidepressant
treatment. The unusually high stability of this protein makes it an attractive
candidate to mediate some of the long-lasting changes in the brain caused by ECS 
treatment. To understand how DeltaFosB might alter brain function, we examined
the gene expression profiles in the hippocampus of inducible transgenic mice that
express DeltaFosB in this brain region by the use of cDNA expression arrays that 
contain 588 genes. Of the 430 genes detected, 20 genes were consistently
upregulated, and 14 genes were downregulated, by >50%. One of the upregulated
genes is cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5). On the basis of its purported role in 
regulating neuronal structure, we studied directly whether cdk5 is a true target 
for DeltaFosB. Upregulation of cdk5 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus was
confirmed by Western blotting in the DeltaFosB-expressing transgenic mice as well
as in rats treated chronically with ECS. Chronic ECS treatment also increased, in
the hippocampus, the phosphorylation state of tau, a microtubule-associated
protein that is a known substrate for cdk5. A 1.6 kb fragment of the cdk5
promoter was cloned, and activity of the promoter was found to be increased after
overexpression of DeltaFosB in cell culture. Moreover, mutation of the single
consensus activator protein-1 site contained within the cdk5 promoter fragment
completely abolished activation of the promoter by DeltaFosB. Together, these
results suggest that cdk5 is one target by which DeltaFosB produces some of its
physiological effects in the hippocampus and thereby mediates certain long-term
consequences of chronic ECS treatment.

Coordinate regulation of Fos and Jun proteins in mouse brain by LiCl.

(1)Department of Psychology, Furman University, Greenville, SC 29613, USA.

Expression of the bZIP transcription factor c-Fos in the nucleus tractus
solitarius (NTS) of the brain stem may allow for genomic encoding of an
unconditioned stimulus (US) during taste aversion learning. Dimerization of c-Fos
with other bZIP proteins of the Jun family is necessary to enable transcriptional
efficacy at the AP-1 sequence of putative target gene promoter regions. The
present study examined the regulation of Fos and Jun proteins by LiCl. Double
immunofluorescence labelling revealed that LiCl causes a coordinate upregulation 
of c-Fos, FosB and JunB, and these proteins are colocalized in a majority of
cells examined in NTS, parabrachial nucleus (PBN), and central nucleus of the
amygdala (CeA). This study demonstrates that a coordinate signalling response
occurs in relevant brain regions in response to LiCl.

Striatal fosB expression is causally linked with l-DOPA-induced abnormal
involuntary movements and the associated upregulation of striatal prodynorphin
mRNA in a rat model of Parkinson's disease.

Rats with unilateral dopamine-denervating lesions sustained a 3-week treatment
with a daily l-DOPA dose that is in the therapeutic range for Parkinson's
disease. In most of the treated animals, chronic l-DOPA administration gradually 
induced abnormal involuntary movements affecting cranial, trunk, and limb muscles
on the side of the body contralateral to the lesion. This effect was paralleled
by an induction of FosB-like immunoreactive proteins in striatal subregions
somatotopically related to the types of movements that had been elicited by
l-DOPA. The induced proteins showed both regional and cellular colocalization
with prodynorphin mRNA. Intrastriatal infusion of fosB antisense inhibited the
development of dyskinetic movements that were related to the striatal subregion
targeted and produced a local specific downregulation of prodynorphin mRNA. These
data provide compelling evidence of a causal role for striatal fosB induction in 
the development of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in the rat and of a positive
regulation of prodynorphin gene expression by FosB-related transcription factors.

c-Jun contributes to amyloid beta-induced neuronal apoptosis but is not necessary
for amyloid beta-induced c-jun induction.

Kentucky, Lexington 40536-0230, USA.

The role of gene expression in neuronal apoptosis may be cell- and apoptotic
stimulus-specific. Previously, we and others showed that amyloid beta
(Abeta)-induced neuronal apoptosis is accompanied by c-jun induction. Moreover,
c-Jun contributes to neuronal death in several apoptosis paradigms involving
survival factor withdrawal. To evaluate the role of c-Jun in Abeta toxicity, we
compared Abeta-induced apoptosis in neurons from murine fetal littermates that
were deficient or wild-type with respect to c-Jun. We report that neurons
deficient for c-jun are relatively resistant to Abeta toxicity, suggesting that
c-Jun contributes to apoptosis in this model. When changes in gene expression
were quantified in neurons treated in parallel, we found that Abeta treatment
surprisingly led to an apparent activation of the c-jun promoter in both the
c-jun-deficient and wild-type neurons, suggesting that c-Jun is not necessary for
activation of the c-jun promoter. Indeed, several genes induced by Abeta in
wild-type neurons were also induced in c-jun-deficient neurons, including c-fos, 
fosB, ngfi-B, and ikappaB. In summary, these results indicate that c-Jun
contributes to Abeta-induced neuronal death but that c-Jun is not necessary for
c-jun induction.

Changes in the regional and compartmental distribution of FosB- and JunB-like
immunoreactivity induced in the dopamine-denervated rat striatum by acute or
chronic L-dopa treatment.

Cenci MA(1), Tranberg A, Andersson M, Hilbertson A.

Author information:

Lund, Wallenberg Neuroscience Center, Sweden.

This study was carried out in order to examine the effects of acute or chronic
L-DOPA treatment on striatally expressed FosB- and JunB-like proteins in a rat
model of Parkinson's disease. Rats with a unilateral, near-total
6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the ascending mesostriatal projection received either
an acute challenge or a one-week treatment with 10 mg/kg/day methyl L-DOPA
(combined with 15 mg/mg benserazide), and were killed at either 3 h or two days
post-injection. Both acute and chronic L-DOPA treatment caused a pronounced,
persistent increase in the number of FosB-like immunoreactive cells in the
dopamine-denervated striata (five- and seven-fold increase, respectively, above
the levels found in lesioned but non-drug-treated controls), but the two
treatment groups differed markedly with respect to both the average amount of
staining per cell, which was two-fold larger in the chronic L-DOPA cases, and the
anatomical distribution of the labeled cells. After an acute injection of L-DOPA,
FosB-positive cells were distributed rather uniformly across all striatal
subregions, whereas chronic L-DOPA treatment induced discrete clusters of
strongly FosB-like immunoreactive cells within medial and central striatal
subregions, as well as in a large, yet sharply defined portion of the lateral
caudate-putamen. Strongly labeled cell clusters that appeared in the medial and
central caudate-putamen were preferentially located within calbindin-poor,
mu-opioid receptor-rich striosomes, whereas the lateral area displaying FosB
activation encompassed both striosomal and matrix domains. In both the medial and
the lateral striatum a near-total overlap was found between strongly FosB-like
immunoreactive cell groups and areas showing pronounced dynorphin expression.
NADPH-diaphorase-positive striatal interneurons did not express FosB-like
immunoreactivity after a 6-hydroxydopamine lesion alone, a negligible proportion 
of them did after an acute L-DOPA challenge, but about 8% of these interneurons
were FosB positive following chronic L-DOPA treatment. Like FosB, JunB was
induced in the DA-denervated striatum by both acute and chronic L-DOPA treatment,
and exhibited similar distribution patterns. However, JunB did not exhibit
prolonged expression kinetics, and was somewhat down-regulated in the chronically
compared with the acutely L-DOPA-treated rats. The present results show that
L-DOPA administration produces a long-lasting increase in the levels of FosB-,
but not JunB-like immunoreactivity in the dopamine-denervated striatum. More
importantly, these data show that striatal induction of FosB- and JunB-like
proteins by chronic L-DOPA treatment exhibits both regional and compartmental
specificity.

Induction of c-fos-like and fosB-like immunoreactivity reveals forebrain neuronal
populations involved differentially in pup-mediated maternal behavior in juvenile
and adult rats.

Juvenile rats can exhibit maternal behavior after being exposed continuously to
rat pups, a process called sensitization. Maternal behavior in juveniles is
robust and is similar to adult maternal behavior (Mayer and Rosenblatt [1979]
Dev. Psychobiol. 12:407-424; Gray and Chesley [684] J. Comp. Psychol. 98:91-99). 
In this study, immunocytochemical detection of the protein products of two
immediate-early genes, c-fos and fosB, was used as a tool to identify forebrain
neuronal populations involved in the maternal behavior of 27-day-old juvenile
rats compared with 60-day-old adults. To sensitize them, rats were exposed
continuously to foster pups. Once they were maternal, they were isolated from
pups overnight, reexposed to pups for 2 hours, and then killed. Nonmaternal
control animals also were isolated overnight and were either reexposed to pups
for 2 hours or kept isolated from pups before killing. The lateral habenula (LH) 
was the only area in which both maternal juveniles and maternal adults had more
c-Fos-immunoreactive (-Ir) neurons compared with controls. In maternal adults,
the number of neurons that expressed c-Fos and FosB immunoreactivity increased in
the medial preoptic area (MPO) and the ventral bed nucleus of the stria
terminalis (BSTv), whereas the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTd) 
and the medial and cortical nuclei of the amygdala (MEA and COA, respectively)
had increases only in the number of neurons that expressed c-Fos
immunoreactivity. In contrast, juveniles, whether or not they were maternal, had 
the same number of c-Fos-IR and FosB-Ir neurons in all these areas. The
adult-like increase in the number of c-Fos-Ir neurons found in maternal juveniles
suggests that the juvenile LH participates in the neural circuit that supports
maternal behavior in an adult-like manner. The lack of c-fos or fosB induction in
the MPO, BSTv, BSTd, COA, or MEA of maternal juveniles compared with maternal
adults may reflect the immaturity of these brain regions in juvenile rats.
Exactly what this immaturity consists of and when the responses of these regions 
become adult-like remain to be determined.

Mapping the effects of alcohol consumption on neural activity could provide
valuable information on mechanisms of alcohol's effects on behavior. The present 
study sought to identify effects of alcohol consumption on expression of
inducible transcription factors (ITFs) in mouse brain. C57BL/6J mice were trained
to consume 10% ethanol/10% sucrose solution during a 30-min limited access
period. Control animals were given access to 10% sucrose solution or water.
Following the final day of the procedure, animals were sacrificed and
immunohistochemical analyses were performed for three ITFs (c-Fos, FosB, and
Zif268). Alcohol-consuming animals had increased ITF expression in several brain 
areas. Specifically, c-Fos was significantly induced in the nucleus accumbens
core (AcbC), the medial posteroventral portion of the central nucleus of the
amygdala (CeMPV), and the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW). Expression of c-Fos was 
significantly lower in the dentate gyrus of alcohol-consuming animals vs.
sucrose-consuming animals. However, it was not significantly different from the
water controls. Induction of c-Fos in AcbC, CeMPV and EW was significantly
related to blood alcohol concentrations (BAC). Furthermore, FosB expression in
the CeMPV and the EW was also significantly higher in the alcohol-consuming
animals vs. water controls. FosB expression in the EW was significantly related
to BAC. The significance of these results is two-fold. First, our experiments
demonstrate that ITF mapping is an effective strategy in identifying
alcohol-induced changes following voluntary consumption. Second, they suggest a
relationship between ITF expression in AcbC, CeMPV and EW and the level of
alcohol intoxication.

Expression pattern of the AP-1 family in breast cancer: association of fosB
expression with a well-differentiated, receptor-positive tumor phenotype.

In the present study, the expression of members of the AP-1 family of
transcription factors in breast tumors (n = 53) was investigated by Western blot 
with antibodies specific for each of the AP-1 family members (c-jun, junB, junD
and c-fos, fosB, fra1 and fra2). The tumors were characterized with regard to
grading, staging, histology, steroid-receptor-expression status and c-erbB2/neu
expression. For comparison, normal breast-tissue samples, human breast-cancer
cell lines (T47D and MDA-MB231) and the transformed human breast epithelial cell 
line HBL100 were also analyzed. For c-jun, junB, c-fos and fra2, a relatively
uniform expression pattern without significant differences among tumors was
observed. junD-protein amounts varied strongly in the tumor specimens.
fosB-expression levels also varied strongly in the tumors, weak/absent expression
being found in 47%, while 45% exhibited strong/very strong levels of expression. 
While none of the other AP-1 family members showed significant correlations with 
clinico-pathological tumor parameters or receptor status, expression of fosB was 
found to correlate significantly with positive steroid-hormone-receptor status
(in the tumors and the cell lines) and a more differentiated tumor phenotype.
Expression of 2 fra-1-specific bands of 33 and 36.5 kDa showed significant
negative correlation with fosB expression, as well as with estrogen-receptor
status and differentiation. We conclude that strong differences in the expression
pattern of AP-1 family members are present in breast tumors, and that certain
members of this family, such as fosB and fra-1, might be involved in the
pathogenesis of these tumors.

Kainic acid seizure suppression by neuropeptide Y is not correlated to immediate

Kainic acid induces seizures and a rapid induction of immediate early genes and
neuronal death. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is implicated in seizure inhibiting
activity. In order to investigate the mechanisms by which NPY inhibits seizure
activity, this study was carried out to measure the levels of mRNAs encoding
three different immediate early genes, in regions of the hippocampus and relate
their induction to the behaviour in the same animals. NPY inhibited both the time
spent in seizures, and the number of generalized seizures. However, NPY did not
inhibit the induction of c-fos, FosB or junB mRNA in any hippocampal region
examined in the same animals, showing lack of correlation between immediate early
gene induction and seizure activity.

DeltaFosB: a molecular mediator of long-term neural and behavioral plasticity.

DeltaFosB, a member of the Fos family of transcription factors, is derived from
the fosB gene via alternative splicing. Just as c-Fos and many other Fos family
members are induced rapidly and transiently in specific brain regions in response
to many types of acute perturbations, novel isoforms of DeltaFosB accumulate in a
region-specific manner in brain uniquely in response to many types of chronic
perturbations, including repeated administration of drugs of abuse or of
antidepressant or antipsychotic treatments. Importantly, once induced, these
DeltaFosB isoforms persist in brain for relatively long periods due to their
extraordinary stability. Mice lacking the fosB gene show abnormal biochemical and
behavioral responses to chronic administration of drugs of abuse or
antidepressant treatments, consistent with an important role for DeltaFosB in
mediating long-term adaptations in the brain. More definitive evidence to support
this hypothesis has recently been provided by inducible transgenic mice, wherein 
biochemical and behavioral changes, which mimic the chronic drug-treated state,
are seen upon overexpression of DeltaFosB in specific brain regions. This
evolving work supports the view that DeltaFosB functions as a type of 'molecular 
switch' that gradually converts acute responses into relatively stable
adaptations that underlie long-term neural and behavioral plasticity to repeated 
stimuli.

Daily rhythm of spontaneous immediate-early gene expression in the rat
suprachiasmatic nucleus.

Author information:

Nocturnal light induces the expression of various immediate-early genes (IEGs) in
the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the primary pacemaker of the circadian system 
of mammals, and causes phase shifts of behavioral rhythms. In the hamster SCN,
some IEGs show both sensitivity to light induction at night and a daily peak of
spontaneous expression near dawn in different regions of the nucleus. To
investigate whether both patterns of IEG expression are observed in the rat SCN, 
the authors studied the expression of NGFI-A, junB, c-fos, and fosB near the time
of subjective dawn in rats entrained to a light-dark 12:12 cycle and then
maintained in constant total darkness for approximately 48 h. They found that
there were two independent rhythms of expression for junB and c-fos mRNAs in the 
SCN: (1) a rhythm of photic sensitivity expressed throughout the night and (2) a 
spontaneous rhythm of expression triggered around dawn and persisting for at
least 2 h into the day. By contrast, fosB and NGFI-A transcripts were expressed
only after light exposure at night and did not exhibit significant levels of
spontaneous expression in the absence of photic input. These observations
demonstrate that the circadian clock gates expression of two independent rhythms 
related to IEG expression in the rat SCN. The rhythm of sensitivity to nocturnal 
light exposure is expressed more strongly in the ventral SCN and may be related
to photic entrainment. The second rhythm is triggered spontaneously in darkness
around subjective dawn and is expressed in more dorsal parts of the SCN.

Selective effects of alcohol drinking on restraint-induced expression of
immediate early genes in mouse brain.

Author information:

Oregon Health Sciences University, 97201, USA. ryabinin@ohsu.edu

BACKGROUND: Analysis of immediate early gene expression in brain is a common
contemporary method for mapping changes in neuronal activation with cellular
resolution. This method has been applied previously in models of involuntary
alcohol exposure. In this study, immunohistochemical expression analysis of
immediate early genes c-fos, fosB, and zif268 was performed in brain of C57BL/6J 
mice after voluntary alcohol consumption.
METHODS: Mice were trained to consume 10% ethanol/10% sucrose, using a 30-min
limited-access paradigm. Animals consumed approximately 1.5 g/kg of ethanol per
session. Control animals consumed 10% sucrose solution. Gene expression was
determined in half of the animals 1.5 hr after the drinking session. Gene
expression in the remaining animals was determined after 0.5 hr of restraint
stress, which is known to elevate expression of immediate early genes in many
brain regions. Analysis of the stressed animals was also performed 1.5 hr after
the drinking session.
RESULTS: Blood alcohol concentrations were significantly reduced in animals
exposed to restraint stress. However, stressed mice showed the greatest
alcohol-induced changes in gene expression. Specifically, animals consuming
ethanol/sucrose with subsequent exposure to restraint stress had lower c-Fos
expression in the CA3 region of hippocampus, and higher c-Fos expression in
nucleus accumbens than mice exposed to restraint stress after drinking the
sucrose solution. Consumption of the ethanol/sucrose solution also significantly 
reduced FosB expression in the basolateral amygdala and lateral hypothalamus, and
Zif268 expression in the CA1 region of the hippocampus of stressed animals.
CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm previous observations showing selective effects
of alcohol administration on immediate early gene expression. Furthermore, the
effects of voluntary alcohol self-administration on immediate early gene
expression differ from involuntary alcohol exposure and suggest several brain
regions as substrates for alcohol consumption.

45267-0527, USA.

PURPOSE: The present study examined whether normal human ocular surfcae epithelia
express AP1 components. Changes in expression patterns of these components in a
case of ocular surface epithelial dysplasia was also evaluated before and after
topical mitomycin C treatment.
METHODS: Specimens of normal corneas (n = 2) and conjunctiva (n = 4) were
obtained from 4 patients during cataract surgery or post mortem, while specimens 
of dysplastic epithelial tissue from the limbus were obtained from one patient.
Specimens were immunohistochemically studied using antibodies against components 
of AP1.
RESULTS: The normal corneal epithelium showed no staining with antibodies against
c-Fos, Fra-2, FosB, c-Jun or JunB, whereas the limbal and bulbar conjunctival
epithelia were positive for c-Fos, Fra-2, and c-Jun. Anti-FosB and -JunB
antibodies reacted weakly with the conjunctival epithelium. JunD was absent in
normal corneal and conjunctival epithelia. The dsyplastic epithelium showed
positive labelling for c-Fos, Fra-2, c-Jun, and JunD throughout its thickness.
Fra-1 was present in all specimens of epithelia examined. The dysplastic
epithelium treated with mitomycin C was not labeled by anti-c-Fos or -Fra-2
antibody.
CONCLUSION: Individual AP1 components show specific expression patterns in normal
ocular surface epithelia and a case of dysplastic epithelium before and after
topical MMC treatment, implying that these factors may play important roles in
modulating epithelial cell function, e.g., proliferation and differentiation.

Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase increases okadaic acid mediated AP-1 expression and 
DNA binding but has no effect on TRE dependent transcription.

Rosenberger SF(1), Gupta A, Bowden GT.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Arizona Health Sciences
Center, Tucson 85724, USA.

By performing in vitro kinase assays we found in papilloma producing 308 mouse
keratinocytes that okadaic acid elevated activities of extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and p38
mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). This okadaic acid mediated activation 
of MAP kinases correlated with increased AP-1 binding to a consensus TPA
responsive element (TRE) and elevated TRE dependent transcription. To determine
the role of p38 MAP kinases in these processes we employed the specific p38 MAP
kinase inhibitor SB 203580. Using orthophosphate labeling we showed a decrease in
phosphorylation of MAPK activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAP-K2) indicating reduced
activity of p38 MAPKs utilizing this kinase as substrate. In contrast, we found
that SB 203580 raised activities of ERK-1/2 and JNKs. Electrophoretic mobility
shift assays revealed an increase in TRE binding activity in response to SB
203580 most likely resulting from increased expression of the major TRE binding
components JunD and FosB as indicated by Western blot analyses. Increased TRE DNA
binding failed to lead to increased transactivation correlating with the
inability of SB 203580 to increase phosphorylation of these AP-1 proteins. These 
data indicate that SB 203580 sensitive p38 MAP kinases are not involved in
okadaic acid mediated increases in TRE DNA binding and transactivation.

Conversion of HPV 18 positive non-tumorigenic HeLa-fibroblast hybrids to invasive
growth involves loss of TNF-alpha mediated repression of viral transcription and 
modification of the AP-1 transcription complex.

Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany.

AP-1 represents a transcription factor, which plays a pivotal role in initiating 
and maintaining the expression of human papillomavirus (HPV) oncoproteins E6 and 
E7 during HPV-linked carcinogenesis of the uterine cervix. AP-1 stands as a
synonym for different proteins such as c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, FosB as well as 
the Fos-related antigens Fra-1 and Fra-2, which can either homo- or
heterodimerize to build up a functional transcription complex. AP-1 is mainly
considered as a positive regulator, which binds to cognate DNA sequences within
the viral upstream regulatory region. By using non-tumorigenic HeLa-fibroblast
hybrids ('444'), their tumorigenic segregants ('CGL3') as well as HPV 18 positive
HeLa cells as a experimental model system, evidence is provided that AP-1
composition differs considerably between these cell lines. In nuclear extracts
obtained from non-tumorigenic cells, Jun-family members (in the order
c-Jun>JunD>JunB) were mainly heterodimerized with Fra-1, a protein, known to be
involved in the abrogation of AP-1 activity under certain experimental
conditions. In contrast, Fra-1 concentration is low in extracts from tumorigenic 
cells. Conversely, c-Fos, the canonical dimerization partner of Jun proteins is
expressed in substantial quantity in HeLa- and 'CGL3' cells, but it is completely
absent in AP-1 complexes from non-tumorigenic '444' cells. Ectopical expression
of c-fos under a heterologous promoter in '444'-cells induces tumorigenicity and 
a change of the Jun/Fra-1 ratio towards a constellation initially detected in
'CGL3'-and HeLa cells. Furthermore, conversion to tumorigenicity is accompanied
with a resistance against TNF-alpha, a cytokine, capable to selectively suppress 
HPV 18 transcription in formerly non-malignant cells. These data propose a novel 
role for AP-1 as an essential component of an inter- and intracellular
surveillance mechanism negatively controlling HPV transcription in
non-tumorigenic cells.

Specific regulation of fos family transcription factors in thymocytes at two
developmental checkpoints.

A central question in T cell development is what makes cortical thymocytes
respond to stimulation in a qualitatively different way than any other thymocyte 
subset. Part of the answer is that AP-1 function changes drastically at two
stages of T cell development. It undergoes striking down-regulation as thymocytes
differentiate from immature, CD4(-)CD8(-) double-negative (DN) TCR- thymocytes to
CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive (DP) TCRlo cortical cells, and then returns in the
cells that mature to TCRhigh, CD4(+)CD8(-) or CD4(-)CD8(+) single-positive (SP)
thymocytes. At all three stages, the jun family mRNAs can be induced similarly.
However, we demonstrate that DP cortical thymocytes are specifically impaired in 
c-fos and fosB mRNA induction, even when stimuli are used that optimize survival 
of the cells and a form of in vitro maturation. fra-2 expression is induction
independent but much lower in DP cells than in the other subsets. Overall Fos
family protein induction accordingly is severely decreased in DP cells. Defective
c-Fos and FosB expression in cortical thymocytes is functionally significant,
because antibody supershift experiments show that in activated immature and
mature thymocytes, most detectable AP-1 DNA-binding complexes do contain c-Fos or
FosB. Thus, defective c-Fos and FosB expression in cortical thymocytes
qualitatively alters any AP-1 complexes they might express. The cortical
thymocytes are not deficient in mRNA expression for any of the constitutive
transcription factors that are known to be needed to drive c-Fos or FosB
expression, so it is possible that the activity of these factors is
developmentally regulated through a post-transcriptional mechanism.

Differential effects of glutamatergic blockade on circadian and photic regulation
of gene expression in the hamster suprachiasmatic nucleus.

Nocturnal light exposure induces immediate-early gene (IEG) expression in the
hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and causes phase shifts of activity
rhythms in mammals. Some IEGs also show a circadian rhythm of expression in the
SCN. While excitatory amino acids (EAAs) are known to be involved in mediating
photic regulation of entrainment and gene expression, their involvement in
spontaneous rhythms of gene expression has not been studied. We assessed the role
of NMDA receptors in the expression of NGFI-A, junB and fosB mRNAs induced by
light pulses of different intensities late in the night (Zeitgeber Time [ZT] 18).
We also examined the spontaneous expression of junB mRNA near subjective dawn (ZT
0). Both dim (5 lx) and bright (100 lx) light pulses induced similar levels of
expression of NGFI-A and junB in the SCN late in the night. fosB mRNA was
strongly induced by bright light but was less sensitive to dim light. At ZT 18,
dizocilpine (MK-801) (3 mg/kg, i.p. ), a non-competitive NMDA receptor
antagonist, almost completely blocked light-evoked expression of IEG mRNAs in the
ventral SCN but not in the dorsolateral region at a mid-caudal level using either
light intensity. At ZT 0, MK-801 strongly reduced light-evoked expression of junB
mRNA in both SCN subdivisions, but inhibited spontaneous expression significantly
only in the dorsal region. NMDA receptors appear to play an important role in
mediating photic input regulating IEG expression only in the ventral SCN at
night. At dawn, however, NMDA receptors are involved in mediating photic effects 
in both parts of the SCN, as well as being involved in spontaneous activation of 
junB expression selectively in the dorsal SCN. These findings support the idea
that the effects in the dorsolateral SCN of nocturnal light exposure are mediated
by different mechanisms than those in other portions of the nucleus.

Compartmental changes in expression of c-Fos and FosB proteins in intact and
dopamine-depleted striatum after chronic apomorphine treatment.

Chronic administration of dopaminergic agonists to rats with unilateral
6-OH-dopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of nigrostriatal pathway produces behavioral
sensitization to subsequent agonist challenges and may serve as a model for
DOPA-induced dyskinesias. In order to understand striatal mechanisms behind this 
long-term behavioral change we examined striatal c-Fos and FosB immunoreactivity 
induced by apomorphine challenge (5 mg/kg, s.c.) after 3 days of withdrawal
following a 2-week administration (5 mg/kg, b.i.d., s.c.) both in intact and
6-OHDA-lesioned animals. In intact rats, c-Fos induction by acute apomorphine
exposure showed a striosomal pattern, whereas FosB immunopositivity was diffusely
distributed. Following chronic administration, FosB induction turned to a clear
striosome dominant pattern similar to c-Fos expression. In denervated striatum,
expression of both proteins was profoundly augmented in a homogeneous pattern
after a single dose of apomorphine. A distinct striosomal patterning appeared
after chronic apomorphine administration in ventromedial part of the denervated
striatum with a down-regulation in the matrix and relative enhancement in
striosomes. These results suggest that compartmental reorganization of striatal
neuronal activity may play a role in long-term behavioral changes induced by
chronic dopaminergic treatments both under normal and dopamine-depleted
conditions.

Attenuated expression of the serum responsive T1 gene in ras transformed
fibroblasts due to the inhibition of c-fos gene activity.

The T1 gene encodes a protein, which shares homology with the IL-1 receptors. In 
fibroblasts, T1 is induced by growth factors and in response to the onset of
oncogene expression. The c-fos gene is transiently activated in these situations 
and was shown to be the major mediator of T1 gene induction. In contrast, the
sustained expression of a ras oncogene in NIH3T3 cells resulted in the
downregulation of basal T1 gene activity and the attenuation of T1 gene induction
in response to mitogenic signals. Likewise, the immediate early genes encoding
c-Fos, FosB, and Fra-2 are repressed in these cells. T1 gene repression could be 
overcome by the forced expression of c-fos in ras transformed fibroblasts. Thus, 
the lack of c-fos gene expression is the likely cause for ras mediated T1 gene
repression. Fra-1, in contrast to the other three members of the Fos family, is
permanently synthesized in high amounts in ras transformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts. We
show that AP-1, which is abundant in these cells throughout the whole cell cycle,
consists predominantly of Fra-1/c-Jun and Fra1/JunD heterodimers. We provide
evidence that Fra1/c-Jun heterodimers are responsible for the repression of c-fos
gene induction following serum stimulation. The introduction of a dominant
negative version of c-Jun into ras transformed fibroblasts was able to rescue
c-fos gene induction in response to serum stimulation, further demonstrating that
AP-1 is indeed involved in c-fos gene repression. We conclude that oncogenic ras 
mediates the activation of the fra-1 gene which results in elevated AP-1 activity
throughout the cell cycle. Fra-1 containing AP-1 complexes repress the c-fos and 
possibly other immediate early genes thereby preventing the induction of certain 
delayed early genes such as the T1 gene in response to mitogenic stimulation.

NK cell cytotoxicity is a fast and efficient mechanism of target cell lysis.
Using transcription analysis, such as multiplex messenger assays, we show here
that natural cytotoxicity exerted by the human NKL cell line correlates with mRNA
accumulation of very early activator protein (AP)-1 transcription factor genes
such as JunB, FosB and c-Fos. In addition, DNA-binding activities of Jun-Fos
heterodimers were observed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays during the
course of natural cytotoxicity. Interaction between immunoglobulin-like
transcript-2/leukocyte Ig-like receptor 1 on NKL cells and HLA-B27 on target
cells leads to an impairment of NKL natural cytotoxicity, which correlates with
an absence of JunB, FosB, and c-Fos transcription, as well as an absence of their
DNA-binding activity. Our studies thus indicate that, despite the rapidity of NK 
cell-mediated lysis, AP-1 transcription factor is activated during the early
stage of NK cell cytolytic programs and that engagement of NK cell inhibitory
receptors for MHC class I molecules impairs the very early activation of AP-1.

Differential regulation of IL-6 promoter activity in a human ovarian-tumor cell
line transfected with various p53 mutants: involvement of AP-1.

Netherlands.

In human ovarian carcinomas, the p53 tumor-suppressor gene is frequently mutated.
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) in these tumors is known to stimulate tumor-cell
proliferation. In order to evaluate the effect of several p53 phenotypes on the
IL-6 promoter activity, the human ovarian wild-type (wt)-p53 cell line A2780 was 
stably transfected with an empty plasmid (CMV) or (m)-175-, m-248- or m-273-p53. 
Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays revealed differences in activator protein-1
(AP-1) DNA-binding activity in the various clones. The CMV and m-273 clone had
comparable amounts of AP-1. The m-175 clone displayed the least and m-248 the
most pronounced AP-1 binding. Supershift analysis of AP-1/DNA complexes with
antibodies against the AP-1 sub-units, c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2, c-Jun, JunB,
and JunD, revealed that the AP-1/DNA complexes in the various clones had
different compositions. Fra proteins were basically present only in m-175 and
m-248 AP-1. IL-6-promoter activity was evaluated in the presence and absence of
the AP-1 binding site which showed that the m-175-transfected clone has a
transcriptional suppressing AP-1, whereas the CMV and the m-273 clones have an
activating AP-1. Exposure of the p53 clones to tumor-necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-alpha) clearly altered the AP-1/DNA complex composition. IL-6-promoter
activity was enhanced by TNF-alpha irrespective of the presence of an AP-1
binding site, while the degree of activation differed in the various clones,
being most pronounced in the m-175 and m-248 clones. The results demonstrate that
the basic and activated IL-6-promoter activity is differently regulated in the
various p53 clones, possibly due to alterations in the AP-1 composition.

Control of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 promoter in
culture-activated rat hepatic stellate cells: regulation by activator protein-1
DNA binding proteins.

In the injured liver hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) undergo a dramatic phenotypic 
transformation known as "activation" in which they become myofibroblast-like and 
express high levels of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1). HSC 
activation is accompanied by transactivation of the TIMP-1 promoter. Truncation
mutagenesis studies delineated a minimal active promoter consisting of
nucleotides -102 to +60 relative to the major start site for transcription.
Removal of an AP-1 site located at nucleotides -93 to -87 caused almost a
complete loss of promoter activity. Analysis of AP-1 DNA binding activities
during culture activation of HSCs initially indicated transient expression of
proteins capable of forming a low mobility AP-1 DNA binding complex (LMAP-1).
LMAP-1 was maximally induced at 24 hours of culture and then fell to undetectable
levels at 120 hours. Western blot studies showed that both c-Fos and c-Jun
underwent similar transient inductions. These temporal changes in c-Fos and c-Jun
activities were unexpected because TIMP-1 mRNA expression is not detected in HSCs
until culture day 3 to 5 and is thereafter sustained at a high level. Previous
work in other cell lineages has established a key role for Pea3 binding proteins 
(Ets-1) in AP-1 mediated transactivation of the TIMP-1 promoter. We show that
HSCs express relatively low levels Ets-1 and Ets-2 and show that mutagenesis of
the Pea3 DNA binding site in the TIMP-1 promoter has less than a twofold effect
on its activity in activated HSCs. Further analysis of AP-1 DNA binding
activities in 7- to 14-day culture activated HSCs led to the discovery of high
mobility AP-1 complexes (HMAP-1). HMAP-1 DNA binding activities were sequence
specific with respect to AP-1 and absent from freshly isolated HSCs. Supershift
EMSA and Western blot studies identified JunD, Fra2, and FosB as potential
components of the HMAP-1. Mutations of the AP-1 site of the TIMP-1 promoter that 
prevented formation of HMAP-1 caused a 70% loss of activity in transfected
activated HSCs. Taken together the data indicate that sustained upregulation of
TIMP-1 gene expression may be at least partially controlled by a novel AP-1
dependent regulation of TIMP-1 promoter activity.

Medial preoptic area (MPA), supraoptic nucleus (SON), magnocellular (MaPVN) and
parvocellular (PaPVN) paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei, and mesencephalic
lateral tegmentum (MLT) are involved in maternal behavior, parturition and
lactation. This study investigated the FosB and Fos immunoreactivity in these
regions of virgin, pregnant, parturient, lactating, and lactating-arrested rats. 
The patterns of FosB and Fos expression were compared between the sections taken 
from the same animals. Quantitative immunohistochemistry revealed a significant
increase in the numbers of FosB-positive neurons in the MPA, SON, MaPVN, and MLT 
of parturient and lactating females as compared with pregnant or virgin animals. 
In lactating rats, the numbers of FosB-positive neurons in the MPA, PaPVN, and
MLT were increased, but the numbers in the SON and MaPVN were decreased as
compared with parturient females. Many Fos-positive neurons were also seen in
parturient and lactating rats, and the patterns of Fos expression in each region 
were quite similar to those of FosB. Moreover, double-labeling
immunohistochemistry revealed that: (1) many FosB-positive nuclei were observed
in oxytocin and vasopressin neurons of the SON and PVN in parturient rats; (2)
within FosB-positive neurons, 89.5% in the MPA, 86.8% in the MLT of parturient
rats, and 92% in the MPA and 90.8% in the MLT of lactating animals were also
Fos-positive. Only a small number of FosB and Fos-positive neurons were seen in
females that were killed in the early stage of parturition. Removal of the
litters immediately after parturition completely eliminated FosB and Fos
expression in each region in the dams. Taken together, the present results
suggest that FosB expression is co-involved with Fos in the neural activation
during parturition and lactation in rats.

A short conserved motif is required for repressor domain function in the
myeloid-specific transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein epsilon.

(1)Department of Cell Biology and Biochemistry, Texas Tech University Health
Sciences Center, Texas 79430, USA.

CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein epsilon (C/EBPepsilon) is expressed almost
exclusively in the myeloid lineage of the hematopoietic system and functions
during terminal differentiation of neutrophils and macrophages, and in the
regulation of cytokine gene expression in macrophages and T cells. We have
undertaken a series of structure/function studies on the murine C/EBPepsilon
polypeptide to investigate the mechanism by which C/EBPepsilon activates
transcription. Studies with deletion mutants and fusion proteins consisting of
C/EBPepsilon sequences joined to the Gal4 DNA-binding protein identified two
transcriptional activation domains in C/EBPepsilon. Removal of sequences between 
the two activation domains or sequences between the second activation domain and 
the C-terminal DNA binding domain significantly increased the activity of
C/EBPepsilon, suggesting the presence of two separate regulatory domains
(designated RD-1epsilon and RD-2epsilon). RD-1epsilon behaved as a classic active
repressor domain being capable of inhibiting adjacent activation domains
irrespective of their origin and when linked to a heterologous DNA binding
domain. Mutagenesis studies revealed a short motif in RD-1epsilon that appears to
be a target site for protein-protein interactions and is conserved in repressor
domains from C/EBPbeta, Sp3, c-Fos, and FosB. The juxtaposition of activation and
repressor domains may permit C/EBPepsilon to function as a transcriptional
activator or repressor at different stages of myeloid differentiation or as an
inducible transcriptional activator of cytokine genes.

Expression of Fos in the circadian system following nonphotic stimulation.

Mikkelsen JD(1), Vrang N, Mrosovsky N.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Anatomy, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.

Syrian hamsters, Mesocricetus auratus, were confined to novel running wheels for 
a 3-h period, starting at approximately circadian time (CT) 4.5 (i.e.,
approaching the middle of their subjective day). It can be reliably predicted
from the amount of running in this situation whether or not there will be a
subsequent phase-shift. Expression of the immediate early genes c-fos and fosB
was examined by immunocytochemistry in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the
intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) of the thalamus, and the medial pretectal area of
hamsters that ran vigorously in the novel wheel and would have phase-shifted.
c-Fos was increased, compared to levels in a control group left in their home
cages, in the IGL, and the pretectum (PT), but decreased in the SCN. No
significant changes in FosB were detected in any region examined. An additional
experiment argued against the possibility that the changes in c-Fos could be
attributed to a rapid advance of the pacemaker to a different phase in the
circadian cycle. Counts of c-Fos-positive cells in the IGL were similar in
animals given pulses of running starting at CT 4.5 and starting at CT 12.5-16
(i.e., in the subjective night when they would have been active anyway).
Altogether the results support the view that activation of the IGL is important
in nonphotic clock resetting, and raise the possibility that the PT may also be
involved in nonphotic resetting. However, the results also indicate that
novelty-induced running does not alter c-Fos induction in a phase-specific manner
in the IGL. The inhibition of c-Fos in the SCN by nonphotic phase-shifting events
contrasts with the well-known inducing effects of light pulses. These different
effects might underlie some of the interactions between nonphotic and photic
zeitgebers when both act together on the circadian system.

Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2-mediated phosphorylation of JunD and
FosB is required for okadaic acid-induced activator protein 1 activation.

Rosenberger SF(1), Finch JS, Gupta A, Bowden GT.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Arizona Health Sciences
Center, Tucson, Arizona 85724, USA.

Previously, we reported that in papilloma-producing 308 mouse keratinocytes, the 
tumor promoter okadaic acid, a serine-threonine phosphatase inhibitor, increased 
binding of activator protein 1 (AP-1) to a consensus
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element (Rosenberger, S. F., and 
Bowden, G. T. (1996) Oncogene 12, 2301-2308). In this study, we investigated the 
correlation between AP-1 DNA binding and transactivation and examined molecular
mechanisms involved in this process. Using a luciferase reporter driven by region
-74 to +63 of the human collagenase gene, we demonstrated induction of
AP-1-mediated transcription following okadaic acid treatment. By performing in
vitro kinase assays, we found elevated activities of extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase. The ERK-1/2-specific inhibitor PD 98059
completely abrogated okadaic acid-induced AP-1 transactivation without altering
AP-1 expression, DNA binding, or complex composition. Phosphorylation analyses
indicated that inhibition of ERK-1/2 decreased okadaic acid-elevated
phosphorylation of JunD and FosB. To further examine the role of JunD and FosB in
okadaic acid-induced AP-1 transactivation, we generated fusion proteins of the
DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 and the transactivation
domain of either JunD or FosB. Cotransfection experiments of these constructs
with a Gal4-luciferase reporter demonstrated that both JunD and FosB are required
for okadaic acid-induced transcription. Treatment with PD 98059 reduced
JunD/FosB-dependent transactivation, suggesting that ERK-1/2-mediated
phosphorylation is a critical component in this process.

Inducible and constitutive transcription factors in the mammalian nervous system:
control of gene expression by Jun, Fos and Krox, and CREB/ATF proteins.

This article reviews findings up to the end of 1997 about the inducible
transcription factors (ITFs) c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2,
Krox-20 (Egr-2) and Krox-24 (NGFI-A, Egr-1, Zif268); and the constitutive
transcription factors (CTFs) CREB, CREM, ATF-2 and SRF as they pertain to gene
expression in the mammalian nervous system. In the first part we consider basic
facts about the expression and activity of these transcription factors: the
organization of the encoding genes and their promoters, the second messenger
cascades converging on their regulatory promoter sites, the control of their
transcription, the binding to dimeric partners and to specific DNA sequences,
their trans-activation potential, and their posttranslational modifications. In
the second part we describe the expression and possible roles of these
transcription factors in neural tissue: in the quiescent brain, during pre- and
postnatal development, following sensory stimulation, nerve transection
(axotomy), neurodegeneration and apoptosis, hypoxia-ischemia, generalized and
limbic seizures, long-term potentiation and learning, drug dependence and
withdrawal, and following stimulation by neurotransmitters, hormones and
neurotrophins. We also describe their expression and possible roles in glial
cells. Finally, we discuss the relevance of their expression for nervous system
functioning under normal and patho-physiological conditions.

Pattern of neuronal activation in rats with CHF after myocardial infarction.

Author information: 
(1)Hypertension Unit, University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa, Ontario,
Canada K1Y 4W7.

To identify neuronal populations possibly contributing to the sympathetic
hyperactivity in rats with congestive heart failure (CHF) after myocardial
infarction (MI), immunohistochemical detection of Fra-like immunoreactivity
(Fra-LI) was used as a marker of long-term neuronal activation. In adult Wistar
rats, 2 and 4 wk after left coronary artery ligation, left ventricular (LV) peak 
systolic pressure and LV end-diastolic pressure were measured, immediately
followed by transcardial perfusion and removal of the heart and brain. The brains
were processed using an antibody that recognizes Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2 for 
the detection of Fra-LI and using an antibody that only recognizes Fos-like
immunoreactivity (Fos-LI). At both 2 and 4 wk after large MI, LV peak systolic
pressure was significantly decreased and LV end-diastolic pressure increased. At 
2 wk post-MI or sham surgery, Fra-LI was observed in several areas of either
group but was significantly higher in the MI versus the sham group in the
magnocellular division of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), supraoptic nucleus
(SON), subfornical organ, and caudal part of the nucleus of the solitary tract.
At 4 wk after large MI, Fra-LI was clearly detected in the parvocellular and
magnocellular divisions of the PVN, SON, and locus ceruleus. Modest expression
was noted in these nuclei in rats with small MI, whereas Fra-like positive
immunoreactive neurons were barely detectable in the sham group 4 wk postsurgery.
In these nuclei, the extent of expression of Fra-LI correlated significantly with
the LV end-diastolic pressure. Fos-LI was only noted in the cerebral cortex.
These results indicate clear activation of neurons as identified by Fra-LI in
specific cardiovascular control centers in rats with CHF 2 and 4 wk post-MI.

Apoptotic cell death was shown to be accompanied or preceded by an elevated
expression of the c-fos protooncogene and DNA binding activity of transcription
factor AP-1. We used Fos-deficient mice to study the role of c-Fos during
programmed cell death in the prostate. In normal mice apoptosis is induced in the
prostate within 2-4 days after castration. Histological features of reduced
secretory activity and morphological signs of programmed cell death become
obvious. No apparent decrease in secretory activity and no epithelial cell death 
were observed in Fos-deficient animals after castration. Fragmentation of nuclear
DNA was measured by in situ terminal transferase reaction. DNA fragmentation was 
observed in the prostate epithelium of control mice after castration whereas no
similar fragmentation was found in Fos-deficient animals. After castration an
AP-1 complex accumulated in the prostate of Fos deficient mice which mainly
consists of FosB, Fra-2 and JunD whereas in control animals the AP-1 complex in
addition contained c-Fos. Our data strongly suggest that c-Fos is required for
programmed cell death of prostate epithelial cells.

Repeated alcohol administration differentially affects c-Fos and FosB protein
immunoreactivity in DBA/2J mice.

Ryabinin AE(1), Wang YM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Behavioral Neuroscience, Portland Alcohol Research Center,
Oregon, USA.

To identify alcohol-responsive brain areas, we have immunohistochemically
analyzed expression of c-Fos, FosB, and other Fos-related antigens in the brain
of inbred DBA/2J mice after a single or repeated injection of alcohol (4 g/kg).
We observed increased expression of c-Fos after alcohol administration in the
central nucleus of amygdala, paraventricular nuclei of hypothalamus and thalamus,
and several other brain areas. Although increased expression of c-Fos in the
nucleus accumbens was also observed, this increase was not statistically
significant. Repeated administration of alcohol had the tendency to reduce
alcohol-induced c-Fos expression in these areas. Immunohistochemical analysis
using an antibody recognizing most Fos-related antigens revealed increases of
expression of these proteins in a partially overlapping set of brain regions. In 
contrast to c-Fos, FosB expression was found to be elevated significantly higher 
after repeated than after acute treatment with alcohol in several brain areas,
including the shell of nucleus accumbens. In contrast to previous c-Fos studies, 
our studies confirm that alcohol administration indeed activates the reward
circuits, including the basal ganglia, and suggest that FosB could serve as a
more sensitive marker for this activation.

Cap 'n' collar-basic leucine zipper (CNC-bZIP) proteins are widely implicated in 
developmental processes throughout different species. Evidence is accumulating
that some of them are also participating in induced gene expression in the adult.
Here we show that the three CNC-bZIP members NF-E2, Nrf1 and Nrf2 are
constitutively expressed in the murine mast cell line CPII and that they form
transcription factor complexes with several AP1 binding proteins. Upon induction,
complexes are observed at the 2 x NF-E2 consensus binding site and the extended
kappa3/AP1(+) site of the TNFalpha promoter. The interaction of Nrf1 with c -jun,
junD, fosB and ATF2 in mast cells is in contrast to the recently reported binding
of Nrf1 alone at the kappa3/AP1(-) site in dendritic cells. We speculated that
this may be the result of the expression of isoforms of Nrf1 in mast cells. Using
a PCR cloning strategy, we have isolated six novel splice variants of this
transcription factor. Some of them have deleted the translational stop codon,
resulting in an Nrf1 protein with an altered leucine zipper region. Expression of
this altered binding/interaction domain interferes with TNFalpha induction,
indicating an interaction of this splice variant with the active AP1/NF-AT
complex at this promoter.

Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol increases sequence-specific AP-1 DNA-binding activity
and Fos-related antigens in the rat brain.

Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta9-THC), the psychoactive principle of
marijuana, has been shown to upregulate the mRNA levels of immediate-early genes 
in the rat brain. Using electrophoretic mobility-shift assay and one-dimensional 
Western blot, we here report that delta9-THC increases Activator protein-1 (AP-1)
DNA-binding and Fos-related antigen activity in discrete areas of the rat brain. 
One hour after the intraperitoneal administration of delta9-THC at a dose of 10
or 15 mg/kg, AP-1 DNA-binding activity in the nucleus accumbens increased by 33
and 49%, respectively, while Western blot showed an increase in both c-Fos, FosB,
Fra-1 (Fos-related antigen) and Fra-2. In the cingulate cortex and
caudate-putamen, delta9-THC significantly increased AP-1 DNA-binding activity
only at the highest dose used (57 and 71%, respectively). While in the
caudate-putamen the increase in AP-1 DNA binding was mainly due to an elevation
of the c-Fos and FosB proteins, the same phenomenon depended on the FosB, Fra-1
and Fra-2 peptides in the cingulate cortex. The effect of delta9-THC on the AP-1 
DNA binding and the Fos-related antigens in the nucleus accumbens was blocked by 
the specific cannabinoid antagonist SR141716 A (3 mg/kg i.p.). delta9-THC failed 
to modify Specificity protein 1 (Sp1) DNA-binding activity. The results indicate 
that delta9-THC activates gene coding for AP-1 DNA-binding proteins by acting on 
cannabinoid receptors, and induces a different transcriptional program on the
early-immediate gene of the Fos family, in different areas in the rat brain,
suggesting that this mechanism might be involved in the central actions of
cannabinoids.

Insulin-stimulated expression of c-fos, fra1 and c-jun accompanies the activation
of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcriptional complex.

JM.

The activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcriptional complex is made up of members of
the Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra1, Fra2) and Jun (c-Jun, JunB, JunD) families and is
stimulated by insulin in several cell types. The mechanism by which insulin
activates this complex is not well understood but it is dependent on the
activation of the Erk1 and Erk2 isoforms of mitogen-activated protein kinases. In
the current study we show that the AP-1 complex isolated from insulin-stimulated 
cells contained c-Fos, Fra1, c-Jun and JunB. The activation of the AP-1 complex
by insulin was accompanied by (i) a transient increase in c-fos expression, and
the transactivation of the ternary complex factors Elk1 and Sap1a, in an
Erk1/Erk2-dependent fashion; (ii) a substantial increase in the expression of
Fra1 protein and mRNA, which was preceded by a transient decrease in its
electrophoretic mobility upon SDS/PAGE, indicative of phosphorylation; and (iii) 
a sustained increase in c-jun expression without increasing c-Jun phosphorylation
on serines 63 and 73 or activation of the stress-activated kinase JNK/SAPK. In
conclusion, insulin appears to stimulate the activity of the AP-1 complex
primarily through a change in the abundance of the components of this complex,
although there may be an additional role for Fra1 phosphorylation.

The acute and chronic effects of adrenocorticotropin on the levels of messenger
ribonucleic acid and protein of steroidogenic enzymes in rat adrenal in vivo.

(1)Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sherbrooke,
Québec, Canada.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of acute (a single
injection) and chronic stimulation (twice daily injection for 9 days) by ACTH on 
changes occurring in the temporal expression of steroidogenic enzymes in the rat 
adrenal in vivo. Under acute ACTH stimulation, the level of steroidogenic acute
regulatory protein (StAR) messenger RNA (mRNA) was increased within 0.5 h in both
zona glomerulosa (ZG) and zona fasciculata-reticularis (ZFR), with maximal
increases of 220-370% and 300-350% in the ZG and ZFR, respectively. Increases in 
the levels of StAR protein in homogenates were also found in the ZG (700%) and
the ZFR (300%), but were delayed compared with those of their mRNA. Furthermore, 
the increase in mitochondrial StAR protein was concomitant with that in the
homogenate, indicating that the entry of StAR into mitochondria might not be
necessary to increase steroidogenesis during the early stimulatory phase. The
levels of c-jun, c-fos, junB, and fosB mRNA in ZG and ZFR were also rapidly
maximally elevated within 0.5-1 h after ACTH administration and fell to near
control levels 5 h posttreatment. The levels of c-jun protein were already
increased in both zones at 1 h, reached 200% at 3 h, and remained elevated 5 h
post-ACTH treatment. The levels of c-Fos protein were maximally increased by 240%
in both zones after 1 h and decreased thereafter to control values at 5 h. Few
changes were observed in the adrenal protein contents of cholesterol side-chain
cleavage cytochrome P450 (P450scc), cytochrome P450 11beta-hydroxylase (P450C11),
cytochrome P450 21-hydroxylase (P450C21), and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 
(3betaHSD). Under chronic stimulation by ACTH, we observed elevations in the
levels of plasma corticosteroids and changes in the mRNA and protein levels of
many adrenal steroidogenic enzymes in both zones. In the ZG, administration of
ACTH for 9 days provoked an increase in the level of StAR mRNA (210-270%) and a
decrease in the levels of 3betaHSD, cytochrome P450 aldosterone synthase
(P450aldo), and AT1 receptor mRNA (by 40%, 70%, and 90%, respectively), whereas
the levels of P450scc and P450C21 mRNA did not differ significantly from the
control values. Western blotting analysis showed that the adrenal ZG protein
levels of StAR and P450scc were increased (150%), 3betaHSD was not changed, and
P450C21 was decreased by 70%. In the ZFR, the levels of P450scc and StAR mRNAs
were increased (260% and 570-870%, respectively). The levels of 3betaHSD,
P450C21, and P450C11 mRNA did not differ from control values in that zone.
Western blotting analysis showed that the ZFR protein level of 3betaHSD was not
changed, P450scc and P450C21 were decreased by 40% and 60%, respectively, and
StAR was increased by 160%. Although c-fos and fosB mRNAs were undetectable after
9 days of chronic ACTH treatment, c-jun mRNA and its protein were still
detectable, suggesting a basic role for this protooncogene in maintaining the
integrity and function of the adrenal cortex. When dexamethasone was administered
to rats for 5 days to inhibit their ACTH secretion, the mRNA levels of many
steroidogenic enzymes were decreased, with the exception of StAR, 3betaHSD, and
P450aldo. These results confirm the importance of physiological concentrations of
ACTH in maintaining normal levels of adrenocortical enzymes and also indicate
that in addition to ACTH, other factors are involved in controlling the
expression of StAR, 3betaHSD, and P450aldo. In conclusion, we showed that ACTH
acutely increases StAR mRNA followed, after a delay, by an increase in the level 
of StAR protein; this suggests that posttranslational modifications of the StAR
precursor occurred during the early stimulatory phase and before the apparent
translation of the newly formed mRNA. The rapid induction of protooncogenes
suggests their participation in the action of ACTH to stimulate steroidogenesis.

Antisense fosB RNA inhibits thrombin-induced hypertrophy in cultured pulmonary
arterial smooth muscle cells.

Lu C(1), Giordano FJ, Bao X, Morris KC, Rothman A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego School of
Medicine, La Jolla, USA.

BACKGROUND: We have previously reported that fosB mRNA is induced by hypertrophic
stimuli (thrombin, angiotensin II) but not proliferative stimuli
(platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor) in pulmonary
arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) (J Biol Chem. 1994;9:6399-6404). Our aim in
the present study was to investigate the potential role of FosB in PASMC
hypertrophy.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Adenoviruses carrying sense or antisense fosB RNA expression
cassettes were used to infect cultured PASMCs with the aim of increasing or
inhibiting fosB expression, respectively. We examined whether fosB expression
modification affected the growth of quiescent PASMCs, thrombin-induced
hypertrophy, or platelet-derived growth factor-induced proliferation. PASMC
growth was assessed by daily cell number count, determination of [3H]leucine
incorporation, and quantification of total cellular protein. Neither an increase 
nor a decrease in FosB protein expression caused a significant change in the
growth of quiescent PASMCs over a period of 96 hours, indicating that FosB alone 
is not sufficient to induce hypertrophy. Modification of FosB levels did not
affect platelet-derived growth factor-induced PASMC proliferation. An increase in
FosB expression did not augment thrombin-induced hypertrophy; however, inhibition
of FosB expression resulted in a diminution of thrombin-induced hypertrophy by
58+/-6% (P<0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that FosB is necessary but not sufficient for 
thrombin-induced hypertrophy in cultured PASMCs.

Essential role of the fosB gene in molecular, cellular, and behavioral actions of
chronic electroconvulsive seizures.

The role of Fos-like transcription factors in neuronal and behavioral plasticity 
has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that a Fos family member protein plays 
physiological roles in the neuronal, electrophysiological, and behavioral
plasticity associated with repeated seizures. Repeated electroconvulsive seizures
(ECS) induced isoforms of DeltaFosB in frontal cortex, an effect that was
associated with increased levels of the NMDA receptor 1 (NMDAR1) glutamate
receptor subunit. Induction of DeltaFosB and the upregulation of NMDAR1 occurred 
within the same neurons in superficial layers of neocortex. Activator protein-1
(AP-1) complexes composed of DeltaFosB were bound to a consensus AP-1 site in the
5'-promoter region of the NMDAR1 gene. The upregulation of NMDAR1 was absent in
mice with a targeted disruption of the fosB gene. In addition, repeated ECS
treatment caused progressively shorter motor seizures (tolerance) in both rats
and wild-type mice, as well as reduced NMDA-induced inward currents in pyramidal 
neurons from superficial layers of the neocortex of wild-type mice. These
behavioral and electrophysiological effects were also significantly attenuated in
fosB mutant mice. These findings identify fosB gene products as transcription
factors critical for molecular, electrophysiological, and behavioral adaptations 
to motor seizures.

Fos family members induce cell cycle entry by activating cyclin D1.

Expression of the fos family of transcription factors is stimulated by growth
factors that induce quiescent cells to reenter the cell cycle, but the cellular
targets of the Fos family that regulate cell cycle reentry have not been
identified. To address this issue, mice that lack two members of the fos family, 
c-fos and fosB, were derived. The fosB-/- c-fos-/- mice are similar in phenotype 
to c-fos-/- mice but are 30% smaller. This decrease in size is consistent with an
abnormality in cell proliferation. Fibroblasts derived from fosB-/- c-fos-/- mice
were found to have a defect in proliferation that results at least in part from a
failure to induce cyclin D1 following serum-stimulated cell cycle reentry.
Although definitive evidence that c-Fos and FosB directly induce cyclin D1
transcription will require further analysis, these findings raise the possibility
that c-Fos and FosB are either direct or indirect transcriptional regulators of
the cyclin D1 gene and may function as a critical link between serum stimulation 
and cell cycle progression.

Difference in topology and numbers of barosensitive catecholaminergic and
cholinergic neurons in the medulla between SHR and WKY rats.

We hypothesized that there may be a significant difference in the neuronal
composition of the baroreceptor reflex pathway between normotensive Wistar Kyoto 
(WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive SHR rats. Using the double-immunoreactive
(IR) method, the topology and numbers of barosensitive neurons that contain
glutamate (Glu), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH),
phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and choline acetyltransferase
(ChAT) were compared between the two strains. The control rats were sham-operated
only for cannulation of the trachea and femoral artery/vein. The test rats were
injected with the pressor agent phenylephrine to raise blood pressure and
stimulate arterial baroreceptors. In both the control and test experiments, the
c-Fos/Glu-, GAD-, TH- and PNMT-IR neurons were found in the nucleus tractus
solitarii (NTS) and ventrolateral medulla (VLM), while the FosB/ChAT-IR neurons
were found in the NTS, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMX) and nucleus
ambiguus (AMB). In the control experiment, no significant difference in numbers
was recognized in any of the double-IR neurons between the two strains. In the
test experiment, the numbers of FosB/ChAT-IR neurons in the NTS, DMX and AMB were
significantly smaller in SHR than in WKY. The numbers of c-Fos/TH-IR neurons in
the caudal VLM were significantly larger in SHR than in WKY. These results
suggest that a smaller number of barosensitive cholinergic neurons in the DMX and
AMB in SHR causes the weaker baroreceptor-cardiac vagal reflex in SHR, and that a
larger number of barosensitive catecholaminergic neurons in the caudal VLM in SHR
are involved in the stronger baroreceptor-vasopressin reflex in SHR.

Human amylin induces "apoptotic" pattern of gene expression concomitant with
cortical neuronal apoptosis.

Tucker HM(1), Rydel RE, Wright S, Estus S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Physiology, Sanders-Brown Center on Aging, University of
Kentucky, Lexington, USA.

Amylin forms large beta-pleated neurotoxic oligomers but shows only 38% sequence 
similarity to A beta. As patterns of gene expression during neuronal apoptosis
appear stimulus and cell type specific, we compared the pattern of amylin-induced
gene expression in rat cortical neurons with that shown previously to be induced 
by A beta in order to evaluate whether these two peptides with different primary 
but similar secondary structure induce apoptosis similarly. Morphologic and
quantitative measures of cell death show widespread apoptotic death after amylin 
treatment. Amylin treatment results in time- and concentration-dependent
inductions of oxidative stress genes, such as cox-2 and IkappaB-alpha.
"Apoptotic" genes are also induced in a time- and concentration-dependent manner,
including c-jun, junB, c-fos, and fosB, followed temporally by a gene known to be
modulated by these transcription factors, i.e., transin. In situ hybridization
analyses show that c-fos expression is restricted largely to neurons with
condensed chromatin, a hallmark of apoptosis. As these genes are not induced in
all models of apoptosis, that amylin-induced neuronal death is genetically
similar to that of A beta suggests that these peptides may be neurotoxic through 
a common mechanism.

Cocaine and the AP-1 transcription factor complex.

Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda,
Maryland 20892-4135, USA. hope@codon.nih.gov

Cocaine addition in humans develops gradually with repeated administrations and
persists long after cocaine has cleared the body. The mechanisms underlying this 
persistent form of neuroplasticity are not understood and can involve both
structural and biochemical mechanisms. The long time course for cocaine addiction
in humans and for development of cocaine self-administration in animal models
suggest the involvement of alterations in gene expression leading to altered
signaling in the brain. In the striatum (Str) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of
rats. Pretreatment with repeated cocaine administrations downregulates the
induction of various immediate early genes (IEGs) by a subsequent acute challenge
with cocaine. Some of these downregulated IEGs encode Fos-related components of
the activator protein-1 (AP-1) complex, which is likely re regulate a number of
genes important for neuronal function. Interestingly, repeated cocaine
administration induces novel delta FosB-related proteins (called chronic
Fos-related antigens (Fras)) in the NAc and Str that replace the downregulated
isoforms of Fos. Unlike the acutely induced, short-lasting isoforms of Fos and
FosB, the chronic Fras persist long after the last cocaine administration. The
known form of delta FosB per se lacks the domain required to activate
transcription. If the chronic Fras are similar in structure to delta FosB, then
the induction of chronic Fras likely leads to a blockade of AP-1-dependent
transcription resulting in altered gene expression. We presently purifying the
chronic Fras to obtain amino acid sequence in order to directly examine our
hypothesis about the effects of repeated cocaine administration on AP-1 dependent
transcription and gene expression in the brain

Transition from SCLC to NSCLC phenotype is accompanied by an increased
TRE-binding activity and recruitment of specific AP-1 proteins.

(1)Zentrum für Innere Medizin, Abteilung Hämatologie/Onkologie,
Philipps-Universität Marburg, Germany.

Transitions from small cell (SCLC) to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells
have been documented both in vitro and in vivo and are thought to be an important
step during tumor progression of human small cell lung cancer towards a
treatment-resistant tumor state. We have screened NSCLC and SCLC cell lines for
differences in the composition of nuclear transcription factors using consensus
oligonucleotide sequences (SRE, Ets, TRE, CRE, B-motif, GAS, E-box). We found
NSCLC cells to exhibit significantly higher AP-1 binding activity than SCLC cells
consistent with the increased expression of CD44, an AP-1 target gene. To gain
more insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences, we
analysed SCLC cell lines (NCI-N592 and NCI-H69) which were phenotypically
transformed into NSCLC-type cells by transfection with activated H-ras and c-myc 
oncogenes. In these cells, ras-induced transition is accompanied by a strong
induction of AP-1-binding activity along with increased expression of CD44 mRNA
and protein. When analysing the composition of the AP-1 complex in more detail
and comparing ras-induced versus phorbol ester-induced changes, we found Fra-1 to
be the major component induced in ras-transfected but not in phorbol-ester
treated or non-treated parental SCLC cells. This finding is paralleled by the
observation that among the various members of the Fos and Jun family analysed
(c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2, c-Jun, JunD, JunB) fra-1 is the only gene to be
exclusively expressed in NSCLC cells but not in cells of SCLC origin. Our data,
thus, point to a histiotype-related mechanism of recruitment among AP-1 proteins 
which may have bearings on the fate of lung cancer development.

Mapping of polyomavirus middle T domain that is responsible for AP-1 activation.

Oliveira ML(1), Roberts TM, Druker BJ, Armelin MC.

Author information: 
(1)Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo, SP, Brasil.

Cell transformation by Polyomavirus middle T (MT) oncoprotein involves binding
and activation of several cytoplasmic proteins that participate in growth
factors-induced mitogenic signal transduction to the nucleus. We have previously 
reported that the AP-1 transcriptional complex is a target for MT during cell
transformation. To analyse the interactions between MT and cellular proteins that
are required for constitutive AP-1 activation, we compared wild type and
transformation-defective MT mutant cell lines. High AP-1 activity, assessed by
gel mobility shift assays, displayed by MT-overexpressing cells, is dependent on 
MT binding to phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (P13K). Treatment with wortmannin (a 
specific P13K inhibitor) leads to decreased AP-1 activity. Supershift and Western
blot analysis with specific antisera, indicate that JunB and cJun, but not cFos
or FosB are present in the AP-1 complex. The results confirm the AP-1 complex as 
a downstream MT target and indicate that AP-1 activation may not be sufficient
for cell transformation, since two transformation-defective MT mutants (250phe
and MT322) display high AP-1 activity.

Transcriptional induction of cyclooxygenase-2 gene by okadaic acid inhibition of 
phosphatase activity in human chondrocytes: co-stimulation of AP-1 and CRE
nuclear binding proteins.

(1)Department of Medicine, University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

The involvement of serine/threonine protein phosphatases in signaling pathways
that control the expression of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene in human
chondrocytes was examined. Okadaic acid (OKA), an inhibitor of protein
phosphatases 1 (PP-1) and 2A (PP-2A), induced a delayed, time-dependent increase 
in the rate of COX-2 gene transcription (runoff assay) resulting in increased
steady-state mRNA levels and enzyme synthesis. The latter response was dose
dependent over a narrow range of 1-30 nmol/L with declining expression and
synthesis of COX-2 at higher concentrations due to cell toxicity. The delayed
increase in COX-2 mRNA expression was accompanied by the induction of the
proto-oncogenes c-jun, junB, junD, and c-fos (but not FosB or Fra-1). Increased
phosphorylation of CREB-1/ATF-1 transcription factors was observed beginning at 4
h and reached a zenith at 8 h. Gel-shift analysis confirmed the up-regulation of 
AP-1 and CRE nuclear binding proteins, though there was little or no OKA-induced 
nuclear protein binding to SP-1, AP-2, NF-kappaB or NF-IL-6 regulatory elements. 
OKA-induced nuclear protein binding to 32P-CRE oligonucleotides was abrogated by 
a pharmacological inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA), KT-5720; the latter
compound also inhibited OKA-induced COX-2 enzyme synthesis. Calphostin C (CalC), 
an inhibitor of PKC isoenzymes, had little effect in this regard. Inhibition of
12P-CRE binding was also observed in the presence of an antibody to CREB-binding 
protein (265-kDa CBP), an integrator and coactivator of cAMP-responsive genes.
The binding to 32P-CRE was unaffected in the presence of excess radioinert AP-1
and COX-2 NF-IL-6 oligonucleotides, although a COX-2 CRE-oligo competed very
efficiently. 32P-AP-1 consensus sequence binding was unaffected by incubation of 
chondrocytes with KT-5720 or CalC, but was dramatically diminished by excess
radioinert AP-1 and CRE-COX-2 oligos. Supershift analysis in the presence of
antibodies to c-Jun, c-Fos, JunD, and JunB suggested that AP-1 complexes were
composed of c-Fos, JunB, and possibly c-Jun. OKA has no effect on total cellular 
PKC activity but caused a delayed time-dependent increase in total PKA activity
and synthesis. OKA suppressed the activity of the MAP kinases, ERK1/2 in a
time-dependent fashion, suggesting that the Raf-1/MEKK1/MEK1/ERK1,2 cascade was
compromised by OKA treatment. By contrast, OKA caused a dramatic increase in
SAPK/JNK expression and activity, indicative of an activation of
MEKK1/JNKK/SAPK/JNK pathway. OKA stimulated a dose-dependent activation of CAT
activity using transfected promoter-CAT constructs harboring the regulatory
elements AP-1 (c-jun promoter) and CRE (CRE-tkCAT). We conclude that in primary
phenotypically stable human chondrocytes, COX-2 gene expression may be controlled
by critical phosphatases that interact with phosphorylation dependent (e.g., MAP 
kinases:AP-1, PKA:CREB/ATF) signaling pathways. AP-1 and CREB/ATF families of
transcription factors may be important substrates for PP-1/PP-2A in human
chondrocytes.

PMA/ionomycin induces Ig kappa 3' enhancer activity which is in part mediated by 
a unique NFAT transcription complex.

Meyer KB(1), Ireland J.

Author information: 
(1)The Wellcome/CRC Institute of Cancer and Developmental Biology, Department of 
Pathology, University of Cambridge, GB. kbm1000@mole.bio.cam.ac.uk

The Ig kappa 3' enhancer is required for high levels of Ig kappa gene expression.
We now show that kappa 3' enhancer function increases five- to eightfold after
stimulation of primary murine B cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) 
and the calcium ionophore ionomycin. In the presence of cyclosporin A this
induction is almost halved, suggesting that transcription factors of the NFAT
family contribute to kappa 3' enhancer induction. Indeed, we identify a novel
NFAT binding site which is required for full enhancer function. We find that this
site is transcriptionally active in stimulated B cells, T cells and fibroblasts
and that both PMA and ionomycin are required for maximal induction. Time course
analysis of the components of the protein-DNA complex in primary lymphocytes
reveals that both NFATp and NFATc are present in the complex after 15 min, while 
only NFATc is detectable after 4 h. This suggests that NFATc plays the dominant
role in controlling long-term responses of this transcription factor family.
Furthermore, JunB, JunD, FosB and cFos form part of the DNA-protein complex in
Bal-17 B cells. Complex formation as well as transcriptional activity can also be
induced by crosslinking of surface Ig. We have, thus, identified a unique NFAT
complex in B cells that contributes to Ig kappa gene expression.

Ischemia-induced CA1 neuronal death is preceded by elevated FosB and Jun
expression and reduced NGFI-A and JunB levels.

Alterations in levels of the immediate-early gene (IEG) proteins Fos, FosB,
DeltaFosB, Jun, JunB, JunD, and NGFI-A were investigated in rat hippocampus by
immunohistochemistry 2, 12, 24, and 48 h after forebrain ischemia. Transient
global ischemia of 20 min, produced by four vessel occlusion (4-VO), elicited
different patterns of IEG expression in vulnerable CA1 and more resilient CA3
neurons. Cell counts revealed that except for JunD and NGFI-A, immunoreactivity
for all examined IEGs was initially elevated by forebrain ischemia in both CA1
and CA3 hippocampal subfields. However, distinct patterns of IEG expression
became evident in these regions at later time points. The pivotal difference was 
the persistence of ischemia-induced elevations of FosB and Jun expression in the 
CA1 region of the hippocampus. Unlike CA3 neurons, where IEG immunoreactivity had
subsided to basal levels by 24-48 h, CA1 neurons continued to display increased
FosB- and Jun-like immunoreactivity 48 h post-ischemia. Western blot analysis
revealed that elevated expression of both FosB and DeltaFosB-like proteins were
responsible for the immunohistochemical detection of enhanced FosB-like
immunoreactivity in CA1 neurons at 48 h. These findings are consistent with
recent in vitro studies that implicate FosB and Jun in gene signalling pathways
responsible for programmed cell death. In contrast to FosB and Jun, JunB
expression declined significantly below basal levels in CA1 neurons at 48 h, yet 
remained unaltered in CA3 neurons. Given that JunB can inhibit the
transactivating properties of Jun, decreased JunB levels may contribute to the
apoptotic death of CA1 neurons by enhancing the transcriptional regulating
activity of Jun. Also notable at 48 h was the complete loss of constitutive
NGFI-A expression from CA1 neurons of ischemic animals. These findings suggest
that persistent elevations in FosB and Jun expression, concurrent with reductions
in JunB and NGFI-A levels, contribute to the apoptotic death of CA1 neurons after
forebrain ischemia.

The modulatory role of nitric oxide in the regulation of proenkephalin and
prodynorphin gene expressions induced by kainic acid in rat hippocampus.

Won JS(1), Im YB, Kim YH, Song DK, Huh SO, Suh HW.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Natural Medicine, College of
Medicine, Hallym University, 1 Okchun-Dong, Chunchon, Kangwon-Do, 200-702, South 
Korea.

The effect of L-arginine (L-ARG), a nitric oxide donor, or
Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NAME), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, on the
regulation of kainic acid (KA)-induced proenkephalin (proENK) and prodynorphin
(proDYN) mRNA expressions in rat hippocampus was studied. The proENK and proDYN
mRNA levels were markedly increased 6 h after KA (10 mg/kg, i.p.) administration.
The elevations of both proENK and proDYN mRNA levels induced by KA was
effectively inhibited by pre-administration of L-ARG (400 mg/kg, i.p.), but was
not affected by pre-treatment with L-NAME (200 mg/kg, i.p.). The blockade of
KA-induced proENK and proDYN mRNA levels by the pre-treatment with L-ARG was well
correlated with proto-oncoprotein levels, such as c-Fos, Fra-2, FosB, JunD, JunB,
and c-Jun, as well as AP-1 and ENKCRE-2 DNA binding activities. The
pre-administration with L-NAME further increased KA-induced c-jun and c-fos mRNA 
levels in addition to their protein product levels, although the pre-treatment
with L-NAME did not affect KA-induced FosB, Fra-2, JunB, and JunD protein levels 
at 6 h after treatment. In addition, the pre-administration with L-NAME further
increased the KA-induced AP-1 and ENKCRE-2 DNA binding activities. Our results
suggest that L-ARG plays an important role in inhibiting KA-induced proENK or
proDYN mRNA expression, and its inhibitory action may be mediated through
reducing the proto-oncoprotein levels, such as c-Fos, Fra-2, FosB, c-Jun, JunD,
and JunB. In addition, L-NAME potentiated the c-Fos or c-Jun gene expression, as 
well as AP-1 or ENKCRE-2 DNA binding activity. However, these increases did not
show the potentiative effect on KA-induced increases of proENK and proDYN mRNA
level.

Distribution of Fos- and Jun-related proteins and activator protein-1 composite
factors in mouse brain induced by neuroleptics.

The mechanisms by which the direct actions of neuroleptics are translated into
therapeutic effects are unknown. We immunocytochemically investigated the
expression of Fos- and Jun-related proteins and examined activator protein-1
DNA-binding activity in ddY mouse brain 120 min after the administration of
haloperidol (1 mg/kg), (-)-sulpiride (20 mg/kg) and a selective dopamine D1
receptor antagonist, SCH23390 (1 mg/kg). The densities of Fos-, FosB-, Fra-1-,
Jun- and JunD-immunoreactive nuclei induced by haloperidol and sulpiride in the
hippocampus, piriform cortex and accumbens nucleus were higher than those in the 
control groups. The same regions showed higher densities of FosB-, Fra-1- and
JunD-immunoreactive nuclei induced by SCH23390 compared with the control groups. 
We investigated further the activator protein-1 composite factors using super gel
shift assays. These results suggested that induced Fos, FosB, Fra-1, Jun and JunD
proteins constitute the activator protein-1 complex after the administration of
haloperidol and sulpiride. In contrast, FosB, Fra-1 and JunD appear to constitute
the activator protein-1 complex after the administration of SCH23390. Therefore, 
the diversity of activator protein-1 composite factors suggests that various
kinds of gene are induced to act by some neuroleptics.

Increased c-fos mRNA expression by human fibroblasts contracting stressed
collagen matrices.

Rosenfeldt H(1), Lee DJ, Grinnell F.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience, University of Texas Southwestern 
Medical School, Dallas 75235-9039, USA.

We studied early changes in gene expression during fibroblast contraction of
stressed collagen matrices. The level of c-fos mRNA increased dramatically and
peaked 50 to 60 min after matrix contraction was initiated. This response did not
require serum and could not be accounted for simply by disruption of the actin
cytoskeleton. Increased c-fos mRNA levels required Ca2+ influx but not the cyclic
AMP or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK 1/2) signaling pathways, both
of which are activated when fibroblasts contract stressed collagen matrices. The 
levels of two other immediate-early genes, fosb and c-jun, also increased
transiently after fibroblast contraction, whereas the levels of fra-1, fra-2,
c-myc, and the transcription factor NF-kappaB remained the same, indicating that 
fibroblast contraction caused changes in a selective group of genes. The increase
in c-fos mRNA during contraction of stressed collagen matrices may reflect a
unique role for c-fos in mechanoregulated events at the end of wound repair.

D1-Receptor-related priming is attenuated by antisense-meditated 'knockdown' of
fosB expression.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmacology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5,
Canada.

Administration of dopamine receptor agonists to rats with unilateral
6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway produce changes in the
denervated striatum that enable a subsequent injection to elicit more vigorous
circling. The molecular basis for this behavioural phenomenon, termed priming, is
unknown. D1-receptor-related priming has been associated with a profound
elevation of immediate-early gene (IEG) expression in the denervated striatum.
Since immediate-early genes encode known transcriptional regulating factors, this
observation has led to the suggestion that IEG induction may play a role in the
gene signaling pathways which mediate priming. In the present study, we addressed
the role of induction of the IEG fosB in dopamine agonist-induced priming by
examining whether inhibition of the synthesis of FosB proteins (FosB and
DeltaFosB) by intrastriatal delivery of an antisense oligonucleotide to fosB
reduced apomorphine-induced priming. Intrastriatal delivery of an antisense, but 
not a random, oligonucleotide to fosB 18 and 6 h before apomorphine reduced the
ability of this mixed D1¿D2-like receptor agonist to prime circling induced by
the specific D1-like receptor agonist SKF 38393. Immunohistochemical analysis
revealed that only the antisense oligonucleotide blocked apomorphine-induced
increases in FosB-like immunoreactivity in the denervated striatum. In contrast, 
apomorphine-induced increases in JunB-, NGFI-A- and Fos2-16-like
immunoreactivities were unaffected by either the antisense or random
oligonucleotides, indicating that the antisense oligonucleotide attenuated
apomorphine-induced priming by selectively blocking the synthesis of FosB
proteins. Taken together, these findings suggest that fosB induction in the
denervated striatum plays a role in mediating D1-receptor-related priming.
Dopamine replacement therapy for Parkinson's disease is often complicated by the 
development of dyskinetic side effects. Results from the present study suggest
that D1-receptor-mediated increases in fosB expression may be involved in those
intracellular events responsible for the generation of these debilitating side
effects.

EGF-induced programmed cell death of human mammary carcinoma MDA-MB-468 cells is 
preceded by activation AP-1.

Schaerli P(1), Jaggi R.

Author information: 
(1)Department for Clinical Research, University of Bern, Switzerland.

MDA-MB-468 is a human mammary adenocarcinoma cell line that overexpresses the
epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and undergoes programmed cell death
(apoptosis) in response to EGF treatment. Programmed cell death was shown to be
greatly enhanced when cells were growth-arrested prior to EGF treatment.
Apoptosis was characterized by an initial rounding up and detachment of the cells
from their substrate starting about 12 h after EGF treatment, followed by
chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation and oligonucleosomal fragmentation 
of the DNA at about 24 to 48 h. Cell death was dependent on de novo protein
synthesis. We found a rapid induction of c-fos, c-jun and junB at the mRNA level 
after about 30 min of EGF treatment and a more delayed upregulation of fosB and
fra-1. The junD gene was expressed in the absence of EGF, and it was moderately
induced within 30 min of growth factor addition. The increase of the different
fos and jun mRNAs were paralleled by an increase of activator protein-1 (AP-1)
DNA binding activity. A characterization of the AP-1 complex revealed similar
levels of several Fos and Jun proteins. Based on the kinetics of AP-1
accumulation and cell death, it seems likely that AP-1 contributes to the
apoptotic cell death of EGF receptor-overexpressing MDA-MB-486 cells.

Expression and processing of G0/G1 switch gene 24 (G0S24/TIS11/TTP/NUP475) RNA in
cultured human blood mononuclear cells.

Heximer SP(1), Cristillo AD, Russell L, Forsdyke DR.

Author information: 
(1)Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.

The human G0/G1 switch (G0S) gene, G0S24, and its rodent immediate-early homolog 
(TIS11, TTP, NUP475) are part of a mammalian gene family whose members encode
CCCH zinc finger domains and domains similar to part of the large subunit of RNA 
polymerase II and to the Mei2 regulator of G1 arrest in fission yeast. We
compared the RNA expression of G0S24 with that of other G0S genes in cultured
blood mononuclear cells and examined the levels of various RNA processing
intermediates. Freshly isolated cells contained high levels of several G0S RNAs, 
which declined by 24 h, suggesting transient spontaneous stimulation during cell 
purification (Heximer et al., 1996). However, in cells preincubated for 24 h,
G0S24 RNA levels remained much higher than those of other G0S genes (107+/-42 x
10(6) molecules/microg of RNA); stimulation with lectin (Con-A) further increased
G0S24 RNA, much of which remained nuclear. Like those of FOS/G0S7, EGR1/G0S30 and
of the gene encoding the regulator of G protein signalling 1 (RGS1), G0S24 RNA
levels increased more in response to a protein kinase C activator than to a
calcium ionophore, whereas the opposite held for FOSB/G0S3 and RGS2/G0S8. With
appropriate PCR primer pairs, we showed a G0S24 RNA processing intermediate,
which crossed the exon-1/intron boundary, and nonpolyadenylated nuclear RNA
extending into the 3' flank, where there is a second CpG island. The
concentration of the latter intermediate (1.2+/-0.2 x 10(6) molecules/microg of
RNA), which increased transiently on cell stimulation, did not account for all
G0S24 nuclear RNA. The levels of G0S24 RNA and both intermediates were increased 
by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, consistent with regulation by a
labile repressor.

Inductions of immediate early genes (IEGS) and ref-1 by human chorionic

Environmental Medicine, Nagoya University, Japan.

The effect of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) on the expression of immediate
early genes (IEGs) including all members of fos and jun family, and c-myc was
studied using mouse Leydig cell line (MA-10 cells) by Northern blot analyses. In 
addition, the induction of ref-1 which enhances DNA binding of fos/jun proteins
was also analyzed. HCG induced a rapid and transient expression of c-fos, fosB,
c-jun, junB, junD and c-myc with a peak at 30 min to 1 h. In contrast, induction 
of fra-1 mRNA was delayed with a peak at 3 hr. However, fra-2 mRNA was
immediately increased by hCG with a peak at 1 h. The ref-1 mRNA was expressed
before the stimulation and its level was not altered by hCG at least for 8 hr.
The differential induction of IEGs and continuous expression of ref-1 mRNA
suggest an important role of their gene products on the regulation of Leydig cell
function by hCG.

Anisomycin selectively desensitizes signalling components involved in stress
kinase activation and fos and jun induction.

Randall Institute, King's College London, United Kingdom.

Anisomycin, a translational inhibitor secreted by Streptomyces spp., strongly
activates the stress-activated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases JNK/SAPK
(c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase) and p38/RK in
mammalian cells, resulting in rapid induction of immediate-early (IE) genes in
the nucleus. Here, we have characterized this response further with respect to
homologous and heterologous desensitization of IE gene induction and stress
kinase activation. We show that anisomycin acts exactly like a signalling agonist
in eliciting highly specific and virtually complete homologous desensitization.
Anisomycin desensitization of a panel of IE genes (c-fos, fosB, c-jun, junB, and 
junD), using epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor,
(bFGF), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), anisomycin, tetradecanoyl
phorbol acetate (TPA), and UV radiation as secondary stimuli, was found to be
extremely specific both with respect to the secondary stimuli and at the level of
individual genes. Further, we show that anisomycin-induced homologous
desensitization is caused by the fact that anisomycin no longer activates the
JNK/SAPK and p38/RK MAP kinase cascades in desensitized cells. In
anisomycin-desensitized cells, activation of JNK/SAPKs by UV radiation and
hyperosmolarity is almost completely lost, and that of the p38/RK cascade is
reduced to about 50% of the normal response. However, all other stimuli produced 
normal or augmented activation of these two kinase cascades in
anisomycin-desensitized cells. These data show that anisomycin behaves like a
true signalling agonist and suggest that the anisomycin-desensitized signalling
component(s) is not involved in JNK/SAPK or p38/RK activation by EGF, bFGF,
TNF-alpha, or TPA but may play a significant role in UV- and
hyperosmolarity-stimulated responses.

Stimulation of muscarinic receptors induces expression of individual fos and jun 
genes through different transduction pathways.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medical Neurochemistry, Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Lund
University Hospital, Sweden.

The transduction pathways coupling muscarinic receptors to induction of fos and
jun genes were investigated in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Stimulation with
carbachol induced expression of c-fos, fosB, c-jun, junB, and junD. This effect
was abolished by pretreatment with atropine, indicating an involvement of
muscarinic receptors. These genes were also induced by activation of protein
kinase C with phorbol ester or by elevating the intracellular Ca2+ concentration 
with a Ca2+ ionophore. The Ca2+ effect was inhibited by KN-62, suggesting an
induction through Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II. Inhibition of protein
kinase C with GF109203X suppressed the carbachol-stimulated increase in mRNA
levels of c-fos, fosB, and junB by approximately 70% but had only minor effects
on the expression of c-jun and junD. On the other hand, preincubation with KN-62 
attenuated the carbachol-induced increase in c-jun and junD expression by 70% but
had no effect on c-fos, fosB, and junB mRNA levels. Simultaneous inhibition of
both protein kinase C and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II completely
abolished the carbachol-stimulated expression of c-jun and junD, but c-fos, fosB,
and junB were still expressed to a certain extent under this condition.
Comparison of the inhibitory effects of GF109203X and Gö 6976 suggests the
involvement of classical protein kinase C isozymes in muscarinic
receptor-stimulated expression of fos and jun genes. These results demonstrate
that the muscarinic receptor-induced expression of individual fos and jun genes
is regulated via different pathways, primarily protein kinase C or
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II.

Ethanol exposure potentiates fosB and junB expression induced by muscarinic
receptor stimulation in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.

Ding WQ(1), Fried U, Larsson C, Alling C.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medical Neurochemistry, Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Lund
University Hospital, Sweden.

Muscarinic receptor stimulation and activation of protein kinase C cause an
increase in fosB and junB transcripts in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. In
this study, the effect of long-term ethanol exposure on these events was
investigated. Carbachol-stimulated fosB and junB expression was elevated in
ethanol-exposed cells compared with control cells. The potentiation was time- and
dose-dependent on ethanol. Preincubation with muscarinic antagonists or protein
kinase C inhibitor demonstrated that the carbachol-stimulated increase in fosB
and junB mRNA levels was primarily mediated via M1 receptors and dependent on the
activity of protein kinase C in both control and ethanol-exposed cells. Long-term
ethanol exposure did not influence the expression of fosB and junB induced by
activation of protein kinase C with phorbol ester. These results demonstrate that
the muscarinic receptor-stimulated fosB and junB expression is sensitive to
ethanol exposure in SH-SY5Y cells, suggesting that these genes participate in the
regulation of neuronal function in response to chronic ethanol treatment.

We studied the time course of expression of the inducible transcription factors
(ITF) c-Fos, FosB, c-Jun, JunB, JunD, Krox-20 and Krox-24, induced by a single
intracerebroventricular injection of angiotensin II, in the subfornical organ
(SFO), median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and
supraoptic nucleus (SON). c-Fos and Krox-24 were expressed rapidly in neurons of 
all four areas but completely disappeared after 4 h. FosB showed a delayed but
persistent expression between 4 h and 24 h in the MnPO and PVN. c-Jun was induced
in the MnPO, SFO and PVN after 1.5 h and in the SON after 4 h. JunB was
selectively expressed in the MnPO and SFO and the level of JunD did not change.
The expression of the pre-existing transcription factors SRF, CREB and ATF-2
which contribute to the transcriptional control of jun, fos and krox genes, was
not affected by Ang II. Thus, we could show for the first time that an acute
stimulation of AT receptors results in continual changes in ITF expression over
24 h.

Behavioural sensitization in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats is related to
compositional changes of the AP-1 transcription factor: evidence for induction of

Rats with unilateral dopamine denervation exhibit turning behaviour in response
to the selective D1 agonist SKF 38393 only after a previous exposure to dopamine 
agonists. We demonstrate here that this 'priming' phenomenon is related to both
an increased expression of the pre-existing AP-1 complex and the occurrence of
novel AP-1 complexes which are formed by FosB- and JunD-related proteins. While
the former protein is expressed as a consequence of the dopamine denervation, the
latter is related to the first exposure to a dopamine agonist. Pre-treatment with
MK-801, an antagonist for glutamatergic receptors, prevents both the priming
development and the AP-1 compositional changes. Rotational behaviour induced by
SKF 38393 closely correlates with the presence of the priming AP-1 complexes,
regardless of the capability of the D1 agonist to induce the immediate-early gene
cFos.

Carolina 27157, USA. ytsuji@bgsm.edu

We have previously reported that the adenovirus E1A oncogene represses the
transcription of the H subunit of the mouse ferritin gene. Subsequent analyses
defined FER-1, a 37-nucleotide sequence located 4.1 kilobases proximal to the
start site of transcription, as the target of E1A-mediated transcriptional
repression and as an enhancer of the ferritin H gene. FER-1 is composed of an
AP1-like sequence followed by an element with dyad symmetry. To achieve maximal
enhancer activity and transcriptional repression by E1A, both elements were
essential. Using gel retardation assays, we now demonstrate that the binding
complex for the AP1-like sequence of FER-1 contains JunD, FosB, and ATF1.
Furthermore, JunD and FosB were able to activate FER-1 enhancer activity by
transient cotransfection with ferritin H-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase
reporter constructs. This augmented enhancer activity was inhibited by E1A. In
addition, we have defined the minimal sequence in the dyad element of FER-1
required for protein interaction. This was determined to be a C-rich sequence to 
which Sp1 and Sp3 bind. Experiments with recombinant proteins indicate that
members of both transcription factor families simultaneously bind FER-1. Taken
together, these results elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in the
transcriptional regulation of a pivotal gene in iron metabolism and provide
insights into the contribution of the Sp1 family to the activation of
AP1-dependent enhancers.

MPTP-Parkinsonism is accompanied by persistent expression of a delta-FosB-like
protein in dopaminergic pathways.

Author information: 
(1)Roche Institute of Molecular Biology, Roche Research Center, Nutley, NJ 07110,
USA.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the relatively selective and
progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. During the
early stages of PD, there are marked compensatory changes in the dopaminergic
system, although little is known of how these responses are orchestrated. Since
the induction of cellular immediate-early genes (cIEG) has been linked to
adaptive responses in the nervous system, we examined their expression in the
N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) murine model of PD. MPTP
elicited an induction of c-fos, fosB, Delta-fosB and c-jun mRNAs in the striatum 
that persisted for 24 h. There was a parallel increase in AP-1-like DNA binding
activity for up to 7 days post-treatment. At 7 days, AP-1 complexes were
specifically supershifted with antisera to FosB and JunD. Immunoblotting of
MPTP-treated striata with a FosB-specific antiserum revealed elevated levels of
approximately 35 and approximately 46 kDa cross-reactive proteins. Only the 35
kDa protein was increased at 7 days. Thus, the persistent AP-1 complex seen in
the MPTP-treated striatum is composed of JunD and a 35 kDa FosB-related protein, 
possibly Delta-FosB. In situ hybridization revealed elevated expression of fosB
and Delta-fosB in the MPTP-treated brain. Expression of both transcripts was
highest in ventral striatum, nucleus accumbens and other terminal fields of the
mesolimbic system, such as the olfactory tubercle and Islands of Calleja. Thus,
the increased fosB expression accompanying MPTP treatment was predominantly
associated with dopaminergic pathways. Since FosB was expressed in both
vulnerable and spared neuronal populations, we suggest that Delta-FosB-JunD
heterodimers play a role in the adaptive response to MPTP neurotoxicity.

It is believed that the induction of the fos and jun gene family of transcription
factors might be at the origin of genetic events leading to the differential
regulation of muscle-specific genes. We have investigated the effect of a 30-min 
running bout in untrained subjects on the expression of the mRNAs of all members 
of the fos and jun gene families, including c-fos, fosB, fosBdel, fra-1, and
fra-2 as well as c-jun, junB, and junD. While the fos family members were
transiently upregulated 10- to 20-fold (an exception being fra-2) the induction
of the jun family members was up to 3-fold only. The induction of c-fos could
also be demonstrated at the protein level. Both c-fos and c-jun mRNAs were
coinduced in muscle fiber nuclei. The induction was not restricted to a
particular fiber type, as expected from established muscle fiber recruitment
schemes, but followed a "patchy" pattern confined to certain regions of the
muscle. The signals leading to the expression of these immediate early genes are 
therefore unclear.

Transient stimulation of the c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase/activator protein 1
pathway and inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase are early effects
in paclitaxel-mediated apoptosis in human B lymphoblasts.

USA.

We demonstrate here that paclitaxel exposure to RPMI-1788 B lymphoblasts caused a
dose- and time-dependent increase in nuclear factor activator protein 1 (AP-1)
DNA binding activity. The basal DNA binding activities of nuclear factors
NF-kappaB and Ets were not affected by paclitaxel. Consistent with these
biochemical events, paclitaxel stimulated AP-1-dependent chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene transcription in vivo, as directed from a
tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate-inducible promoter. AP-1 binding activity of
nuclear extracts isolated from paclitaxel treated cells was reduced following
immunodepletion with antibodies directed against individual Jun family proteins, 
whereas anti-cFos, anti-Fra1, and anti-FosB antibodies were not inhibitory.
Paclitaxel caused a rapid and transient increase in c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase
(JNK) activity, a proposed mediator of stress activation pathways. By contrast,
exposure to paclitaxel produced a transient reduction in the extracellular
signal-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase 2 (ERK2) activity, a proposed
mediator of growth factor-stimulated proliferation pathways. Transient activation
of the c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase/AP-1 pathway, together with down-regulation of
ERK2 activity, may be a key event in the early response of RPMI-1788 B
lymphoblasts to paclitaxel exposure.

Effects of the inhibition of p38/RK MAP kinase on induction of five fos and jun
genes by diverse stimuli.

Hazzalin CA(1), Cuenda A, Cano E, Cohen P, Mahadevan LC.

(1)Developmental Biology Research Centre, The Randall Institute, King's College
London, UK.

The ERK, JNK/SAPK and p38/RK MAP kinase subtypes are differentially activated by 
physiological, pharmacological and stress stimuli; all three subtypes are
implicated in immediate-early (IE) gene induction by these agents. Here, we have 
asked whether inhibition of a single MAP kinase subtype under these conditions
would generally alter induction of several IE genes in a similar way or whether
this would differentially up- and down-regulate particular IE genes, an issue
which bears on the question of whether individual MAP kinases are strictly
targeted to specific IE genes, or whether they might catalyse phosphorylation
events that affect several IE genes in the same way. SB 203580, an inhibitor of
p38/RK, has been used to analyse the role of this kinase in the induction of five
IE genes (c-fos, fosB, c-jun, junB and junD) under diverse conditions of
stimulation. In C3H 10T1/2 cells, p38/RK and its downstream kinase MAPKAP K-2 are
activated by all stimuli used with the exception of TPA. The specificity of SB
203580 as a p38/RK inhibitor in these cells is demonstrated; it does not affect
ERKs or JNK/SAPKs but does result in a small increase in the activity of the
upstream kinase MKK6, the principal p38/RK activator in these cells. We find that
inhibition of p38/RK under these conditions produces general effects on all five 
IE genes as a group in three ways. First, induction of all five genes in response
to okadaic acid or tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is not significantly 
altered by SB 203580. Second, in cells stimulated with anisomycin or U.V.
radiation, SB 203580 potently inhibits all of the induced IE genes. Finally, SB
203580 enhances induction of all five IE genes in EGF-treated cells; these
enhanced mRNA levels are not due to stabilisation of labile mRNA transcripts. The
significance of these results to current thinking on the relationship between
distinct MAP kinase subtypes and specific IE genes is discussed.

Plasmid-encoded fosfomycin resistance in bacteria isolated from the urinary tract
in a multicentre survey.

Julián Clavería s/n, Oviedo, Spain.

Sixty out of 219 fosfomycin-resistant bacteria selected from more than 7400
urinary pathogens in an epidemiological multicentre survey performed in Italy
were screened for plasmid genes fosA and fosB conferring fosfomycin resistance.
Only five strains, three enterobacteria and two staphylococci, carried plasmids
harbouring, respectively, fosA and fosB genes. Fosfomycin resistance in the other
isolates was caused by an alteration of the chromosomally encoded GlpT transport 
system. One strain, Morganella morganii 279, incorporated alpha-glycerolphosphate
and its mechanism of fosfomycin resistance needs to be further investigated. Our 
study showed that PCR amplification is the most accurate, simple and rapid method
for epidemiological studies of plasmid-encoded fosfomycin resistance, and that
fosfomycin resistance conferred by plasmid genes (both fosA and fosB) accounts
for only a low percentage of the fosfomycin-resistant strains.

Aggregated amyloid-beta protein induces cortical neuronal apoptosis and
concomitant "apoptotic" pattern of gene induction.

To gain a molecular understanding of neuronal responses to amyloid-beta peptide
(Abeta), we have analyzed the effects of Abeta treatment on neuronal gene
expression in vitro by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and in situ
hybridization. Treatment of cultured rat cortical neurons with Abeta1-40 results 
in a widespread apoptotic neuronal death. Associated with death is an induction
of several members of the immediate early gene family. Specifically, we (1)
report the time-dependent and robust induction of c-jun, junB, c-fos, and fosB,
as well as transin, which is induced by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers and encodes an
extracellular matrix protease; these gene inductions appear to be selective
because other Jun and Fos family members, i.e., junD and fra-1, are induced only 
marginally; (2) show that the c-jun induction is widespread, whereas c-fos
expression is restricted to a subset of neurons, typically those with condensed
chromatin, which is a hallmark of apoptosis; (3) correlate gene induction and
neuronal death by showing that each has a similar dose-response to Abeta; and (4)
demonstrate that both cell death and immediate early gene induction are dependent
on Abeta aggregation state. This overall gene expression pattern during this
"physiologically inappropriate" apoptotic stimulus is markedly similar to the
pattern we previously identified after a "physiologically appropriate" stimulus, 
i.e., the NGF deprivation-induced death of sympathetic neurons. Hence, the
parallels identified here further our understanding of the genetic alterations
that may lead neurons to apoptosis in response to markedly different insults.

FosB mutant mice: loss of chronic cocaine induction of Fos-related proteins and
heightened sensitivity to cocaine's psychomotor and rewarding effects.

Chronic exposure to cocaine leads to prominent, long-lasting changes in behavior 
that characterize a state of addiction. The striatum, including the nucleus
accumbens and caudoputamen, is an important substrate for these actions. We
previously have shown that long-lasting Fos-related proteins of 35-37 kDa are
induced in the striatum by chronic cocaine administration. In the present study, 
the identity and functional role of these Fos-related proteins were examined
using fosB mutant mice. The striatum of these mice completely lacked basal levels
of the 35- to 37-kDa Fos-related proteins as well as their induction by chronic
cocaine administration. This deficiency was associated with enhanced behavioral
responses to cocaine: fosB mutant mice showed exaggerated locomotor activation in
response to initial cocaine exposures as well as robust conditioned place
preference to a lower dose of cocaine, compared with wild-type littermates. These
results establish the long-lasting Fos-related proteins as products of the fosB
gene (specifically DeltaFosB isoforms) and suggest that transcriptional
regulation by fosB gene products plays a critical role in cocaine-induced
behavioral responses. This finding demonstrates that a Fos family member protein 
plays a functional role in behavioral responses to drugs of abuse and implicates 
fosB gene products as important determinants of cocaine abuse.

Absence of a persistently elevated 37 kDa fos-related antigen and AP-1-like
DNA-binding activity in the brains of kainic acid-treated fosB null mice.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Developmental Neurobiology, St. Jude Children's Research
Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.

Chronic stimulation of the nervous system or acute administration of kainic acid 
results in a persistent increase in AP-1-like DNA-binding activity in the brain. 
However, the composition and function of these AP-1 complexes remain
controversial. By comparing wild-type and fosB-null mice treated with kainic
acid, we establish that the complexes comprise JunD in association with an
approximately 37 kDa Delta-FosB species. Delta-FosB was expressed persistently in
neurons in many areas of the CNS, even though fosB mRNA only increased
transiently. This implies that the 37 kDa protein is very stable. fosB-/- mice
are predisposed to seizures. Therefore, the chronic expression of Delta-FosB
elicited by kainic acid seizures may be indicative of a compensatory/protective
role in the pathophysiology of epilepsy.

Changes in expression of delta FosB and the Fos family proteins following NMDA
receptor activation in the rat striatum.

Hollen KM(1), Nakabeppu Y, Davies SW.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, University College London,
UK.

Receptor-induced expression of transcription factors of the activator protein-1
(AP-1) family in neurons occurs in a unique temporal pattern which regulates
subsequent downstream gene expression. We investigated the expression of the Fos 
family proteins following injection of the NMDA receptor agonist quinolinic acid 
(QA) into the rat striatum. The c-Fos protein is rapidly and transiently
expressed, followed by the sequential and overlapping expression in the same
striatal neurons of FosB, from 4 to 8 h post-lesion and delta FosB from 6 h to
beyond 30 h post-lesion. Analysis confirms that mRNA transcripts of both fosB and
alternatively spliced delta fosB are expressed in the striatum after QA lesion.
The Fos-related antigens Fra-1 and Fra-2 and three previously uncharacterized
c-Fos-related proteins were additionally found in the striatum which do not
increase following lesion. These proteins are related to the highly conserved
DNA-binding domain of c-Fos but are not immunologically related to the FosB
protein as has been previously reported for proteins induced following chronic
stimulation of the striatum. We additionally demonstrate that the c-Fos and delta
FosB proteins expressed following QA lesion bind to the functional AP-1 site in
the promoter of the nerve growth factor (NGF) gene, the regulation of which
temporally and spatially coincides with the AP-1 protein increases in the
QA-lesioned striatum. However, the levels of binding to the NGF AP-1 site do not 
increase throughout time following lesion despite the induced expression of Fos
family proteins, suggesting that the regulation of the NGF gene in this paradigm 
does not simply involve increased binding to the AP-1 site in the NGF gene
promoter.

AP-1 and Egr DNA-binding activities are increased in rat brain during ethanol
withdrawal.

Beckmann AM(1), Matsumoto I, Wilce PA.

Author information: 
(1)Alcohol Research Unit, Department of Biochemistry, The University of
Queensland, St. Lucia, Australia.

The DNA-binding activities of AP-1 and Egr proteins were investigated in nuclear 
extracts of rat brain regions during ethanol withdrawal. Both DNA-binding
activities were transiently elevated in the hippocampus and cerebellum 16 h after
withdrawal. In the cerebral cortex, AP-1 and Egr DNA-binding activities increased
at 16 h and persisted until 32 and 72 h, respectively. The AP-1 DNA-binding
activities in all regions at all times after withdrawal were composed of FosB,
c-Jun, JunB, and JunD. c-Fos was detected at all times in the cerebral cortex, at
16 h only in the hippocampus, and from 16 to 72 h in the cerebellum. Withdrawal
severity did not affect the composition of the AP-1 DNA-binding activities. Two
Egr DNA-binding activities were present in the cortex and hippocampus. The
faster-migrating complex predominated in hippocampus, and only the
slower-migrating complex (identified as Egr-1) was present in the cerebellum. The
increase in DNA-binding activity of immediate early gene-encoded transcription
factors supports their proposed role in initiating a cascade of altered gene
expression underlying the long-term neuronal response to ethanol withdrawal.

Chronic Fos-related antigens: stable variants of deltaFosB induced in brain by
chronic treatments.

School of Medicine, Connecticut Mental Health Center, New Haven, Connecticut

Fos family transcription factors are believed to play an important role in the
transcriptional responses of the brain to a variety of stimuli. Previous studies 
have described 35 and 37 kDa Fos-like proteins, termed chronic Fos-related
antigens (FRAs), that are induced in brain in a region-specific manner in
response to several chronic perturbations, including chronic electroconvulsive
seizures, psychotropic drug treatments, and lesions. We show in this study that
the chronic FRAs are isoforms of deltaFosB, a truncated splice variant of FosB
that accumulate in brain after chronic treatments because of their stability.
doffaFosB cDNA encodes the expression of 33, 35, and 37 kDa proteins that arise
from a single AUG translation start site. The 35 and 37 kDa proteins correspond
to the chronic FRAs that are induced in brain by chronic treatments, whereas the 
33 kDa protein corresponds to a Fos-like protein that is induced in brain by
acute treatments, findings based on migration on one- and two-dimensional Western
blots with anti-FRA and anti-FosB antibodies. Using cells in which deltaFosB or
FosB expression is under the control of a tetracycline-regulated gene expression 
system, we show that the 37 kDa deltaFosB protein exhibits a remarkably long
half-life, the 35 kDa DeltaFosB protein exhibits an intermediate half-life, and
the 33 kDa deltaFosB protein and all FosB-derived proteins exhibit relatively
short half-lives. Moreover, we show that the 33 kDa deltaFosB protein is the
first to appear after activation of deltaFosB expression. Finally, deltaFosB
proteins are shown to possess DNA-binding activity and to exert potent
transactivating effects in reporter gene assays. Together, these findings support
a scheme wherein deltaFosB, expressed as a 33 kDa protein, is modified to form
highly stable isoforms of 35 and 37 kDa. As a result, these stable isoforms
gradually accumulate in the brain with repeated treatments to mediate forms of
long-lasting neural and behavioral plasticity.

Local release of GABAergic inhibition in the motor cortex induces immediate-early
gene expression in indirect pathway neurons of the striatum.

Berretta S(1), Parthasarathy HB, Graybiel AM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.

The neocortex is thought to exert a powerful influence over the functions of the 
basal ganglia via its projection to the striatum. It is not known, however,
whether corticostriatal effects are similar across different types of striatal
projection neurons and interneurons or are unique for cells having different
functions within striatal networks. To examine this question, we developed a
method for focal synchronous activation of the primary motor cortex (MI) of
freely moving rats by local release of GABAergic inhibition. With this method, we
monitored cortically evoked activation of two immediate-early gene protein
products, c-Fos and JunB, in phenotypically identified striatal neurons. We
further studied the influence of glutamate receptor antagonists on the stimulated
expression of c-Fos, JunB, FosB, and NGFI-A. Local disinhibition of MI elicited
remarkably selective induction of c-Fos and JunB in enkephalinergic projection
neurons. These indirect pathway neurons, through their projections to the globus 
pallidus, can inhibit thalamocortical motor circuits. The dynorphin-containing
projection neurons of the direct pathway, with opposite effects on the
thalamocortical circuits, showed very little induction of c-Fos or JunB. The gene
response of striatal interneurons was also highly selective, affecting
principally parvalbumin- and NADPH diaphorase-expressing interneurons. The
glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 strongly reduced the cortically evoked 
striatal gene expression in all cell types for each gene examined. Because the
gene induction that we found followed known corticostriatal somatotopy, was
dose-dependent, and was selectively sensitive to glutamate receptor antagonists, 
we suggest that the differential activation patterns reflect functional
specialization of cortical inputs to the direct and indirect pathways of the
basal ganglia and functional plasticity within these circuits.

Barosensitive cardioinhibitory neurons in the medulla: comparison of
FosB/ChAT-positive neurons with CT-HRP-labeled neurons.

The purpose of this study was to survey the distribution pattern of barosensitive
cardioinhibitory preganglionic neurons in the medulla. This was done using Wistar
rats anesthetized with fentanyl/midazolam. After stimulating arterial
baroreceptors by blood pressure increase due to phenylephrine, c-Fos, FosB, c-Jun
and JunD/choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive neurons were surveyed in the
medulla. After placing HRP conjugated by cholera toxin (CT-HRP) on the
sino-atrial node, CT-HRP-labeled neurons were surveyed in the medulla. In the
phenylephrine pressor test experiment, we ascertained that in the target neurons 
fosB was more sensitive to baroreceptor stimulation than any other immediate
early genes such as c-fos, c-jun and junD. Using the FosB/ChAT method, we
succeeded in determining sites of the barosensitive cardioinhibitory neurons that
had never been found with the c-Fos/ChAT method. The distribution pattern of the 
FosB/ChAT-positive neurons was compared with that of the CT-HRP-labeled neurons. 
We found that the distribution pattern of the FosB/ChAT-positive neurons in the
dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMX) and ambiguus nucleus (AMB) was
similar to that of the CT-HRP-labeled neurons at the level between the caudal end
of the area postrema (AP) and the caudal end of the nucleus of the trapezoid
body. This suggests that the barosensitive FosB/ChAT-positive neurons in the DMX 
and AMB mediate the cardioinhibitory baroreceptor reflex.

The effect of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and cAMP on induction of AP-1 activity

The immunostimulant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), produced by
monocytes/macrophages in response to inflammatory disorders, regulates gene
expression in part through induction of mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPKs), including the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) (c-Jun N-terminal
kinase [JNK]) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). In
testicular Leydig cells, the induction of steroidogenesis by cAMP is inhibited by
TNF alpha. To examine the potential mechanisms governing the mutual inhibition
between cAMP and TNF alpha in Leydig cells, the intracellular signaling pathways 
that contribute to AP-1-dependent gene expression were examined in the mouse
MA-10 Leydig cell line. TNF alpha induced SAPK activity sixfold at 15 min, and
the PKC inhibitor calphostin C reduced the induction of SAPK by 30%. cAMP induced
SAPK activity twofold but reduced TNF alpha-induced SAPK activity. ERK activity
was inhibited by both cAMP and TNFa. TNFa increased c-Jun protein, but only
weakly induced FOS proteins (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2) whereas cAMP
increased the abundance of several FOS proteins (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2), 
with little effect on c-Jun levels. AP-1 binding activity, assessed using
electrophoretic mobility shift assays, was increased twofold by TNF alpha and
fivefold by cAMP. Cyclic AMP alone induced AP-1-responsive reporter (p3TPLUX)
activity threefold after 2 h with peak effect of 4-fold at 4 hr. AP-1 reporter
was not induced by TNF alpha alone but in the presence of cAMP, TNF alpha induced
AP-1 reporter activity 12-fold. In conclusion, TNF alpha and cAMP induce distinct
components that separately contribute to the modulation of AP-1 activity in MA-10
cells.

Comparison of the primary structures and theoretical prediction of the potential 
antigenic determinant of the deduced Fos proteins reveals the presence of a
nonstructural and hydrophilic region juxtaposed to the leucine zipper and
nonconserved among the Fos protein family. To develop monoclonal anti-peptide
antibodies capable of distinguishing all Fos-proteins, synthetic peptides
specific for the mentioned predicted region were synthesized manually by the
"tea-bag" method. Immunization of Balb/c mice with fosB-related synthetic peptide
BSA gave rise to mouse hybridoma cell line K21 (IgG1, kappa) secreting highly
specific antibodies against corresponding human fosB protein. Fine mapping of the
MAb K21 indicated that the minimal epitope essential for the recognition is the
sequence GPGPLAE.

Cross-family interaction between the bHLHZip USF and bZip Fra1 proteins results

Heterodimerization among the basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins or among the
basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) proteins confers a multitude of
combinational activities to these transcription factors. To further examine the
function of the bHLHZip protein, USF, we screened for cellular proteins which
could directly interact with USF using the yeast two-hybrid system. A bZip
protein, Fra1, was found to efficiently interact with USF. USF specifically
interacts with Fra1 but not with other closely related family members, c-Fos,
Fra2, FosB, or with c-Jun. Both the bHLHZip and the N-terminal regions of Fra1
are required for efficient interaction with USF. In vivo association between USF 
and Fra1 has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Expression of exogenous
USF led to a decrease in AP1-dependent transcription in F9 cells. Co-expression
of exogenous Fra1 restored the AP1 activity in a dose-dependent manner. These
data show that USF and Fra1 physically and functionally interact demonstrating
that cross-talk occurs between factors of distantly related transcription
families.

Transcriptional activation and transformation by FosB protein require
phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal activation domain.

Skinner M(1), Qu S, Moore C, Wisdom R.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine,
Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.

The transcription factor AP-1, composed of Fos-Jun dimers, mediates some aspects 
of the cellular response to growth factors. Transcriptional activation and
neoplastic transformation by FosB, a member of the Fos family of proteins,
require the presence of a potent C-terminal activation domain. Here we show by
mutational analysis that the FosB C-terminal domain has a proline-based motif
that is essential for both of these functions. Phosphopeptide mapping experiments
show that the C terminus of FosB is phosphorylated within a cluster of
functionally redundant serine residues that is adjacent to this proline-based
motif. Mutation of these serine residues to alanine severely reduces the ability 
of this region to function as an activation domain and inhibits the ability of
FosB protein to function as a transforming protein. Several observations suggest 
that the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of these sites is distinct from
the mitogen-activation protein kinases and stress-activated protein kinases. Our 
results show that transcriptional activation and neoplastic transformation by the
FosB protein are dependent on phosphorylation within the C terminus. This form of
control may provide a potential mechanism of signal integration at the level of a
single transcription factor.

Transformation by ras modifies AP1 composition and activity.

The Ras proteins play a central role in regulating cell growth and their mutation
can lead to abnormal proliferation. To analyse the potential link betwen AP1
activity, encoded by members of the jun and fos gene families, and Ras-mediated
cellular transformation, we have studied several NIH3T3 clones which overexpress 
the Ha-Ras or Ki-Ras oncogenes. These transformed fibroblasts accumulated higher 
levels of cJun, JunB, Fra1 and Fra2 proteins relative to their normal
counterparts. They also displayed increased AP1 DNA binding activity which was
predominantly composed of cJun and Fra1 containing dimers. Following serum
stimulation of Ras clones, the elevated levels of cJun and Fral remained steady, 
while the induction of JunB and Fra2 was partially attenuated. Moreover,
deregulated Ras signaling resulted in a complete loss of the serum inducibility
of cFos and FosB. Ectopic co-expression of cJun and Fra1 in NIH3T3 fibroblasts
led to a transformed phenotype, attenuation of cFos serum inducibility, increased
AP1 activity and Cyclin D1 accumulation, all characteristics of oncogenic Ras
expressing cells. These results demonstrate that cJun and Fra1 are crucial
mediators of the Ras-transformation process.

Cell-type specific DNA-protein interactions at the tissue-type plasminogen

(1)Gaubius Laboratory, TNO-PG, PO Box 2215, 2301 CE Leiden, The Netherlands.

Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) gene expression in human endothelial
cells and HeLa cells is stimulated by the protein kinase C activator phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) at the level of transcription. To study the
mechanism of transcriptional regulation, we have characterized a segment of the
t-PA gene extending from -135 to +100 by in vivo footprinting analysis [dimethyl 
sulphate (DMS) method] and gel mobility shift assay. In vivo footprinting
analysis revealed changes in cleavage pattern in five distinct promoter elements 
in both endothelial cells and HeLa cells, including a PMA-responsive element
(TRE), a CTF/NF-1 binding site and three GC-boxes, and an altered cleavage
pattern of the TRE and CTF/NF-1 element after PMA treatment of HeLa cells.
Although endothelial cells and HeLa cells differed in the exact G residues
protected by nuclear proteins,in vitro bandshift analysis showed that nuclear
protein binding to the t-PA promoter was qualitatively and quantitatively very
similar in both cell types, except for the TRE. Protein binding to the TRE under 
non- stimulated conditions was much higher in human endothelial cells than in
HeLa cells, and this TRE-bound protein showed a lower dissociation rate in the
endothelial cells than in HeLa cells. In endothelial cells, the proteins bound to
the TRE consisted mainly of the AP-1 family members JunD and Fra-2, while in HeLa
cells predominantly JunD, FosB and Fra-2 were bound. The proteins bound to the
other protected promoter elements were identified as SP-1 (GC-box II and III) and
CTF/NF-1 (CTF/NF-1 binding site). After PMA treatment of the cells, AP-1 and SP-1
binding was increased two-fold in endothelial cell nuclear extracts and >20-fold 
in HeLa nuclear extracts. In the endothelial cells, all Jun and Fos forms (c-Jun,
JunB, JunD, c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1 and Fra-2) were part of the AP-1 complex after PMA
induction. In HeLa cells, the complex consisted predominantly of c-Jun and the
Fos family members FosB and Fra-2. In the light of previous studies involving
mutational analysis of the human and murine t-PA promoter our results underline
an important role of the five identified promoter regions in basal and
PMA-stimulated t-PA gene expression in intact human endothelial cells and HeLa
cells. The small differences in DMS protection pattern and differences in the
individual AP-1 components bound in endothelial cells and HeLa cells point to
subtle cell-type specific differences in t-PA gene regulation.

Long-term expression of Fos-related antigen and transient expression of delta
FosB associated with seizures in the rat hippocampus and striatum.

Systemic administration of kainic acid (KA), an analogue of glutamic acid, causes
limbic seizures and pathophysiological changes in adult rats that are very
similar to human temporal lobe epilepsy. One of the earliest changes in gene
expression after treatment with KA is the induction of immediate-early genes. The
fos and jun families are frequently studied immediate-early genes that are
induced by KA. Several groups, including ours, have recently reported that a
35-kDa Fos-related antigen (FRA) is induced for a protracted time by various
stimuli. It has been suggested that this FRA is delta FosB, which has a molecular
mass of approximately 35 kDa. The present study characterizes the long-term
expression of FRA and delta FosB after systemic treatment with KA.
Immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis using an antibody that cross-reacts
with all known FRAs showed that a 35-kDa FRA was induced at high levels in both
the hippocampus and striatum for up to 1 month by KA. A semiquantitative PCR
analysis showed that delta FosB was induced by KA, but its expression lasted for 
only 6 h. This result was also verified by northern blot analysis. These results 
suggested that the 35-kDa FRA with long-term elevated levels seen with western
blot analysis and immunocytochemistry is a new species of the FRA and not delta
FosB. The long-term expression of FRA in both the hippocampus and striatum may be
associated with the pathophysiological changes after KA administration.

Sequence analysis and expression in cultured lymphocytes of the human FOSB gene
(G0S3).

Heximer SP, Cristillo AD, Russell L, Forsdyke DR.

G0S3 is a member of a set of putative G0/G1 switch regulatory genes (G0S genes)
selected by screening cDNA libraries prepared from human blood mononuclear cells 
cultured for 2 hr with lectin and cycloheximide. The sequence shows high homology
with the murine FOSB gene, which encodes a component of the AP1 transcriptional
regulator. Comparison of cDNA and genomic sequences reveals a 4-exon structure
characteristic of the FOS family of genes. Freshly isolated cells show high
levels of FOSB/G0S3 and FOS/G0S7 mRNAs, which decline rapidly during incubation
in culture medium. The kinetics of expression suggest that the high initial
levels are caused by the isolation procedure, and do not reflect constitutive
expression. In cells preincubated for a day, levels of FOS mRNA reach a maximum
20 min after the addition of lectin and decline to control levels over the next 3
hr. Levels of FOSB mRNA reach a maximum 40 min after the addition of lectin and
decline to control levels over the next 6 hr. In freshly isolated cells, both FOS
and FOSB mRNAs increase dramatically in response to the protein synthesis
inhibitor cycloheximide. In preincubated cells, the cycloheximide response is
decreased, especially in the case of FOSB. These differences in expression of FOS
and FOSB suggest different roles and regulation. Regions of low base
order-dependent stem-loop potential in the region of the gene are defined. These 
indicate where base order has been adapted for purposes other than stem-loop
stability (e.g., encoding proteins or gene regulation). Regions of low potential 
in a 68.5-kb genomic segment containing the FOSB gene suggest that the potential 
may help locate genes in uncharted DNA sequences.

Expression of fosB mRNA in the hamster suprachiasmatic nucleus is induced at only
selected circadian phases.

Guido ME(1), Rusak B, Robertson HA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Psychology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

We have studied the expression of fosB mRNA in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) 
of hamsters by in situ hybridization using oligonucleotides with sequences
complementary to the C-terminal of the fosB mRNA sequence. In animals exposed for
48 h to darkness, there was little or no background expression in SCN cells of
fosB mRNA at any circadian phase. Light pulses (30 min) were able to induce fosB 
expression only during the subjective night. Transcripts of fosB increased
rapidly to peak by the end of a 30-min light pulse. Light-induced increases
gradually declined in darkness, but levels were still elevated for up to 150 min 
after the light pulse. Induction in response to a light pulse was largely
restricted to the ventrolateral portion of the nucleus which receives the
heaviest retinal projection. The temporal and anatomical pattern of fosB mRNA
expression in the hamster SCN therefore resembles that reported previously for
other immediate-early genes, such as c-fos.

Nuclear NF-ATp is a hallmark of unstimulated B cells from B-CLL patients.

B lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of patients with chronic lymphocytic
leukaemia (CLL) were analysed for the nuclear presence and DNA binding of a panel
of transcription factors which are involved in the gene control of lymphoid
cells. The following transcription factors were studied: the Octamer factors
Oct-1 and Oct-2, members of the AP-1 factor family, NF-AT factors, in particular 
NF-ATp, and members of the Rel/NF-kB family. We show that the constitutive
nuclear translocation of NF-ATp, a member of the growing family of NF-AT factors,
is a hallmark of nonstimulated B cells from CLL patients that distinguishes B-CLL
cells from 'normal' B lymphocytes. Constitutive nuclear appearance was also
observed for NF-kB2/p52. Constitutive binding of further factor proteins to DNA, 
such as JunD, c-Fos and FosB, was detected in several patients whereas the
localisation and DNA binding of other factors such as c-Jun, RelA/p65 and c-Rel
was unaltered. It is remarkable that in B-CLL cells the nuclear appearance and
DNA binding of specific transcription factors is dramatically affected whereas
other members of the same factor family remained unaltered in these leukemic
cells. It remains to be shown which molecular events lead to the specific
'pre-activation', i.e. constitutive nuclear translocation and DNA binding, of
these members of NF-AT, NF-kB and AP-1 factor families.

Dioxin induces transcription of fos and jun genes by Ah receptor-dependent and
-independent pathways.

Hoffer A(1), Chang CY, Puga A.

(1)Center for Environmental Genetics, University of Cincinnati Medical Center,
Ohio 45267-0056, USA.

Halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
(TCDD; dioxin), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzo[a]pyrene, are
environmental contaminants that cause many apparently unrelated toxic effects. In
a previous study, we have shown that treatment of mouse hepatoma cells with TCDD 
or B(a)P results in an increase in mRNA levels of the immediate-early
protooncogenes c-fos, c-jun, junB, and junD, and the concomitant increase of the 
DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor AP-1, a dimer of FOS and JUN
proteins. To analyze the mechanism of fos/jun activation by TCDD we have used
electrophoretic mobility shift and transient expression assays of reporter gene
constructs containing response elements for 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate
(TRE), serum (SRE), cAMP (CRE), and aromatic hydrocarbons (AhRE) from the fos and
jun genes fused to the firefly luciferase gene under the control of the SV40
minimal promoter. In mouse hepatoma Hepa-1 cells, which have Ah receptor (AHR)
and Ah receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) proteins, inclusion of TRE, SRE, and 
the AhRE motifs from c-jun and junD, but not CRE or the AhREs from c-fos, fosB,
and junB, causes a large TCDD-dependent increase in luciferase expression. In
agreement with these results, c-jun and junD, but not c-fos, fosB, and junB
AhREs, competed with a canonical Cyp1A1 AhRE for binding to the AHR ARNT
heterodimeric complex. In African Green Monkey CV-1 cells, which lack AHR,
expression plasmids with AhRE motifs require coexpression of AHR and ARNT for
TCDD to stimulate luciferase expression. In contrast, SRE-containing expression
plasmids respond equally well to TCDD whether or not AHR and ARNT are
coexpressed. These results suggest that TCDD induces expression of the
immediate-early response genes fos and jun by activation of possibly three
separate signal transduction pathways, at least one of which does not require a
functional Ah receptor complex.

Complex activation of inducible transcription factors in the brain of
normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats following central angiotensin II
administration.

Lebrun CJ(1), Blume A, Herdegen T, Möllenhoff E, Unger T.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmacology, University of Kiel, Germany.

The effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of angiotensin II (Ang
II) on the expression of inducible transcription factors (ITF) (c-Fos, FosB,
c-Jun, JunB, JunD, Krox-20 and Krox-24) in the brain of conscious rats were
assessed immunohistochemically using polyclonal antisera. Ang II (1, 10, 100 ng) 
induced after 90 min a dose-dependent expression of c-Fos, FosB, c-Jun, JunB and 
Krox-24, which was confined to four specific brain areas, namely the subfornical 
organ (SFO), median preoptic area (MnPO), paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and
supraoptic nucleus (SON). In the above-mentioned regions, JunD exhibited a high
basal staining which was not visibly altered by Ang II. Krox 20 was not induced
by AnG II. FosB was only induced 4 h after i.c.v. injection of 100 ng Ang II in
the MnPO and PVN. The Ang II-AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan, applied i.c.v. 5 
min prior to Ang II (100 ng, i.c.v.) prevented the Ang II-induced ITF expression.
In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) but not in Wistar rats with nephrogenic 
hypertension due to aortic banding (WIab), the Ang II-induced expression of
c-Fos, and c-Jun was enhanced in all four areas when compared to normotensive
Wistar Kyoto (WKY)- and Wistar (WI) rats. The Ang II-induced expression of
Krox-24 in the SFO, MnPO and PVN in SHR was also significantly increased when
compared to WKY, WI and WIab rats. Our data demonstrate that a stimulation of
periventricular Ang II-AT1 receptors induces a temporally and spatially highly
differentiated expression pattern of ITFs restricted to four distinct regions of 
the forebrain involved in blood pressure regulation and body fluid homeostasis.
The points to a strictly regulated expression of target genes in the respective
regions. The enhanced Ang II-induced expression of ITFs in SHR compared to
normotensive controls is not due to elevated blood pressure itself, since it was 
not observed in secondary hypertensive rats WIab. Thus, the increased sensitivity
to Ang II in SHR appears to be genetically determined. The target genes regulated
by Ang II-induced ITFs will have to be identified.

Atypical and typical neuroleptic treatments induce distinct programs of
transcription factor expression in the striatum.

Hiroi N(1), Graybiel AM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Cambridge 02139, USA.

Atypical and typical neuroleptics, when administered chronically, can bring about
profound but contrasting changes in schizophrenic symptoms and motor activation
and dramatically modulate brain neurochemistry. To explore the transcriptional
events that might be involved in this neurochemical regulation, we used
immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting to examine the expression patterns of two
bZip transcription factors, c-Fos and FosB, in the striatum of rats treated
acutely and chronically with neuroleptic drugs of different classes. Typical and 
atypical neuroleptic drugs produced contrasting regulatory effects on a FosB-like
protein of ca. 36-39 kDa, the molecular weight of truncated FosB (delta FosB).
Chronic treatments with two typical neuroleptics, haloperidol and metoclopramide,
but not with the atypical neuroleptic clozapine, led to markedly enhanced
FosB-like immunoreactivity in the caudoputamen. Further, c-Fos-like protein in
the striatum, considered a marker for the induction of antipsychotic actions by
neuroleptic treatments, was downregulated by chronic treatment with the two
potent antipsychotic drugs tested, but not by chronic treatment with
metoclopramide, which has low antipsychotic efficacy but induces extrapyramidal
side effects. These results suggest that chronic treatments with neuroleptics
having different effects on cognitive and motor behavior induce different
long-term changes in transcription factor expression in the striatum.
Nevertheless, we found that neuroleptics of both classes regulated transcription 
factor expression in overlapping populations of striatal neurons expressing
enkephalin or DARPP-32. Contrasting patterns of transcriptional regulation in
these neurons may thus contribute to the distinct neurochemical and behavioral
effects that characterize neuroleptics of different classes.

Epidermal keratinocytes - genes and their regulation.

Eckert RL(1), Welter JF.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Case Western Reserve University
School of Medicine, Cleveland.

In recent years, the human epidermal keratinocyte has been extensively studied.
These studies have shown that epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth 
factor-beta (TGFbeta), retinoids, phorbol ester, vitamin D and other agents
regulate keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and gene
expression. We review progress in understanding the mechanisms that regulate
keratinocyte structural gene expression. In most cases little is known regarding 
the factors that regulate gene expression in response to a physiological agent.
However, the available results suggest a role for a variety of transcription
factors, including STAT factors, NFkappaB, octamer site (OCT) binding proteins
and activator protein 1 (AP1) factors in regulating expression of these genes.
Among these transcriptional regulators, AP1 appears to play a central role. We
review the current literature regarding the regulation of involucrin, loricin,
transglutaminase type 1 and cytokeratin gene expression. This survey indicates
that the AP1 family of transcriptional regulators is implicated in the regulation
of nearly all of these genes. We also discuss recent studies which describe the
distribution of the AP1 factors, c-jun, junB, junD, Fra-1,Fra-2, c-fos and fosB, 
in epidermis.

Ethanol exposure increases expression of c-jun and junD in human neuroblastoma
cells.

Ding WQ(1), Larsson C, Alling C.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medical Neurochemistry, Lund University Hospital, Sweden.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ethanol exposure on the
expression of fos and jun genes. Exposure of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells to
ethanol for 2-4 days caused a dose-dependent increase in c-jun and junD mRNA
levels, whereas mRNAs for c-fos, fosB and junB were not detectable in control or 
ethanol-treated cells. Four days of ethanol exposure also enhanced the AP-1
binding activity. Experiments with actinomycin D demonstrated that ethanol did
not influence the degradation of c-jun and junD mRNAs. These results demonstrate 
that long-term exposure to ethanol increases c-jun and junD expression. This
effect may be one of the mechanisms through which ethanol influences the gene
regulatory system in neuronal cells.

Defective transcription of the IL-2 gene is associated with impaired expression
of c-Fos, FosB, and JunB in anergic T helper 1 cells.

Mondino A(1), Whaley CD, DeSilva DR, Li W, Jenkins MK, Mueller DL.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.

Anergic CD4+ Th cells do not produce IL-2 when challenged with Ag-pulsed
accessory cells because of a transcriptional defect. In this work, we report that
these anergic T cells are defective in their ability to up-regulate protein
binding and transactivation at two critical IL-2 DNA enhancer elements: NF-AT
(nuclear factor of activated T cells; a sequence that binds a heterotrimeric
NFATp, Fos, and Jun protein complex) and Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) (that binds
Fos and Jun heterodimers). Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts showed that 
the impaired DNA-protein interactions in anergic T cells were associated with
poor expression of the inducible AP-1 family members c-Fos, FosB, and JunB.
However, the reduced expression of these proteins was not the result of a global 
TCR/CD3-signaling defect because CD3 cross-linking induced an equivalent increase
in intracellular-free calcium ions, as well as NFATp dephosphorylation,
translocation to the nucleus, and DNA binding in both normal and anergic T cells.
Thus, defective IL-2 gene transcription appears to be due, at least in part, to a
selective block in the expression of the AP-1 Fos and Jun family members in
anergic T cells.

A new process of cancer prevention mediated through inhibition of tumor necrosis

(1)Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.

Mechanisms of cancer prevention were studied using structurally different
cancer-preventive agents, sarcophytol A, canventol, (-)-epigallo-catechin
gallate, and tamoxifen, based on our evidence that tumor necrosis factor alpha
(TNF-alpha) acts as an endogenous tumor promoter relevant to human
carcinogenesis. Pretreatment with the four preventive agents commonly inhibited
TNF-alpha mRNA expression and TNF-alpha release in BALB/3T3 cells induced by a
tumor promoter, okadaic acid, whereas the expression of early response genes
(c-jun, junB, c-fos, and fosB) was enhanced. These results strongly suggest that 
inhibition of TNF-alpha mRNA expression and its release is a new process of
cancer prevention.

The glucocorticoid receptor and c-jun promoters contain AP-1 sites that bind
different AP-1 transcription factors.

Breslin MB(1), Vedeckis WV.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Louisiana State University
Medical Center, 1901 Perdido Street, 70112-1393, New Orleans, LA.

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) promoter contains several potential
transcription factor recognition sites, including a putative AP-1 site. The GR
promoter AP-1 site differs from the consensus AP-1 site by a nucleotide
substitution, while the c-jun promoter contains a functionally characterized AP-1
site that varies from the consensus AP-1 site by a nucleotide insertion.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using nuclear extracts from 
a mouse pituitary tumor cell line (AtT-20) to test the binding capability of the 
AP-1 proteins, Jun and Fos, to the putative glucocorticoid receptor and the c-jun
AP-1 sites. In addition, a comparison of the complexes formed at the GR AP-1 and 
c-jun AP-1 sites was done using antibodies specific for the Jun and Fos family
members. The complexes formed with the GR AP-1 and c-jun AP-1 sites revealed
striking differences. The GR AP-1 site formed complexes with both Jun and Fos
family members. JunD was the most abundant Jun family member present, followed by
JunB. cJun was absent from the complex. The amount of Fra-2 was greater than FosB
in GR promoter AP-1 site complexes while Fra-1 was absent. A small amount of cFos
may bind to the GR AP-1 site. In contrast to the GR promoter AP-1 site, only Jun 
family members were involved with complex formation on the c-jun promoter using
AtT-20-cell nuclear extract, with JunD binding exceeding that of cJun. These
results confirm previous studies suggesting that the c-jun promoter is stimulated
solely by Jun family members. They also show preferential binding of Jun family
members to different AP-1 sites present in different promoters. Finally, this
study supports the hypothesis that the coordinate regulation of GR and c-jun gene
regulation is mediated by crosstalk involving a Jun protein.

Adenovirus-mediated increase of exogenous and inhibition of endogenous fosB gene 
expression in cultured pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego School of
Medicine, La Jolla 92093, USA.

Modification of gene expression in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells
(PASMCs) could be a valuable tool for investigating the role of specific gene
products in normal and pathological PASMC growth, and a novel potential therapy
for pulmonary vascular diseases. To examine the direct role of fosB protein in
PASMC growth, adenovirus (Ad) vectors were used to transfer sense or antisense
full-length fosB cDNAs to cultured PASMCs to modify fosB expression, and
investigate the effects of this modification on PASMC growth. The full-length
fosB cDNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) early gene promoter was 
constructed into an E1 region-deleted, replication-deficient human type 5 Ad
vector in either sense or antisense orientation. Forty-eight hours after
infection with the sense construct (Ad.S. fosB) at 3 plaque-forming units per
cell (pfu/cell). PASMCs expressed abundant fosB mRNA and fosB protein. FosB
protein was detected by immunohistochemistry in approximately 95% of the infected
cells. PASMCs infected with Ad.S.fosB at ratios of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.3, and 10
pfu/cell showed a dose-dependent increase in fosB mRNA expression, with
half-maximal and maximal expression at 1 and 10 pfu/cell, respectively. The
increase in fosB mRNA expression was detected as early as 8 h and persisted for
25 days after infection. Forty-eight hours after infection with the antisense
construct (Ad.A.fosB) at 3 pfu/cell, very low levels of fosB mRNA were detected
by Northern blotting, in which the double-stranded fosB cDNA was labeled and used
as a hybridization probe. FosB protein was undetectable by Western blotting or
immunocytochemical analyses in the Ad.A.fosB infected cells. Cytopathical effects
were observed when PASMCs were infected with either Ad.S.fosB or Ad.A.fosB at
ratios of 10 pfu/cell or higher. Infection of serum-deprived PASMCs with
Ad.S.fosB or Ad.A.fosB alone at 3 pfu/cell did not affect cellular growth. These 
results show that adenoviral vectors containing sense or antisense fosB cDNA
expression units can be used to effectively modify fosB gene expression. Although
changes in fos-B gene expression did not affect cellular growth, this model
system offers a very effective method for elucidating the biological roles of
other gene products and studying the pathways of PASMC gene regulation and signal
transduction.

A defect in nurturing in mice lacking the immediate early gene fosB.

Brown JR(1), Ye H, Bronson RT, Dikkes P, Greenberg ME.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Neuroscience, Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston,
Massachusetts 02115, USA.

Although expression of the Fos family of transcription factors is induced by
environmental stimuli that trigger adaptive neuronal response, evidence that Fos 
family members mediate these responses is lacking. To address this issue, mice
were generated with an inactivating mutation in the fosB gene. fosB mutant mice
are profoundly deficient in their ability to nurture young animals but are normal
with respect to other cognitive and sensory functions. The nurturing defect is
likely due to the absence of FosB in the preoptic area, a region of the
hypothalamus that is critical for nurturing. These observations suggest that a
transcription factor controls a complex behavior by regulating a specific
neuronal circuit and indicate that nurturing in mammals has a genetic component.

Growth regulation by peroxisome proliferators: opposing activities in early and

Peroxisome proliferators (PPs) are a diverse group of nongenotoxic rodent liver
carcinogens. One potential mechanism for the carcinogenicity of PPs is epigenetic
modulation of growth-regulatory signal transduction pathways. We investigated the
effects of PPs on growth-regulatory gene expression and cell proliferation in
immortalized mouse liver cells, comparing PPs with other growth regulators and
tumor promoters of known activity. The PPs Wy-14643, mono-ethylhexyl phthalate,
clofibrate, and ciprofibrate ethyl-ester were found to be potent inducers of
immediate-early gene expression (including c-fos, c-jun, junB, egr-1, NUP475, and
to a lesser extent fosB, JE, and KC, with maximal expression seen 1 h after
treatment of serum-deprived quiescent cells. The gene induction was potently
inhibited by protein kinase inhibitor H7
[1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride] but not by H8
[N-¿2-(methyl-amino)ethyl¿-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride],
indomethacin, or nordihydroguaiaretic acid. Compared with other growth
regulators, the profile of PP-induced gene expression was most similar to that
induced by arachidonic acid and eicosatetraynoic acid. The induction of
immediate-early gene expression by PPs was followed by enhanced progression into 
S phase (DNA synthesis) when quiescent cells were treated with the PPs for only 1
h, washed, and then incubated without PPs. However, no stimulation of DNA
synthesis was seen when the PPs were continually present. Furthermore, the PPs
inhibited serum-induced DNA synthesis, even when they were added 6 h after serum 
stimulation (in late G1). Dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, a unique PP in being a 
steroid, had no detectable effect on immediate-early gene expression, did not
stimulate DNA synthesis when applied for only 1 h, but did inhibit serum-induced 
DNA synthesis. Thapsigargin and A23187 mimicked this mitoinhibitory activity of
PPs, suggesting that calcium mobilization by PPs might be involved. Our results
demonstrate that PPs can modulate cell proliferation either by a stimulatory
activity that functions in early G1, associated with activation of
immediate-early gene expression, or by an inhibitory activity that functions in
late G1; both activities could potentially play a role in tumor promotion by PPs.

The mechanism or mechanisms by which ras oncogenes induce morphological
transformation and anchorage-independent growth are poorly understood but are
thought to involve stable alterations in gene expression. We previously described
a genetically dominant, mutant rat fibroblast cell line (ER-1-2) that is
resistant to ras-induced anchorage-independent growth. We now describe a cell
line derived from ER-1-2 cells, termed ER-1-2T, that has apparently sustained a
second, dominant mutation that conferred on these cells the ability to form
colonies in soft agar. Analysis of these and control cell lines demonstrated that
deregulation of many of the genes commonly associated with the transformed
phenotype could be dissociated from anchorage-independent growth. After infection
with a ras-expressing retrovirus, both control and ER-1-2 cell lines
constitutively expressed elevated levels of the c-jun, junB, fosB, c-myc,
collagenase, ornithine decarboxylase, osteopontin, stromelysin, cathepsin L, and 
insulin-like growth factor 1 genes. These data indicate that signaling events
downstream of ras were largely intact in ER-1-2 cells and that the defect in
these cells lies either on a pathway separate from those that control stable,
ras-mediated expression of these genes or at a point in the cell-division cycle
distinct from those that control expression of the genes. In contrast, only
c-jun, junB, c-myc, and ornithine decarboxylase were expressed at a significantly
elevated level in ER-1-2T cells. Thus, deregulated expression of the genes
analyzed was not sufficient for anchorage-independent growth. Furthermore,
deregulation of most of them was also not necessary.

Visual stimulation regulates the expression of transcription factors and
modulates the composition of AP-1 in visual cortex.

It is believed that long-term changes in neuronal function are orchestrated by
transcription factors, such as AP-1 and ZIF 268, which are in turn regulated by
synaptic stimulation. To further our understanding of the functional effects of
such expression, we have examined the DNA-binding activities of both AP-1 and ZIF
268 by way of electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) on nuclear extracts
from visual cortices of rats treated with selective light exposure. Visual
stimulation after dark rearing increased the DNA-binding activities of both AP-1 
and ZIF 268 to their highest levels within 2 hr. ZIF 268 thereafter dropped to
levels similar to that observed in naive animals, whereas AP-1 DNA-binding
activity continued to remain elevated even after 24 hr of stimulation. The
components of the AP-1 complex, when assessed by EMSA-supershift analysis, showed
considerable variability under different conditions of exposure. FosB and JunD
were the major constituents of AP-1 in both naive and dark-reared animals. Brief 
visual stimulation (2 hr) added c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunB to this complex, whereas
prolonged stimulation (6-24 hr) reduced c-Fos and c-Jun levels significantly,
leaving only FosB, JunB, and JunD as the major components of AP-1. These results 
suggest that transcriptional control by AP-1 may be generated by selective
combinatorial interactions of different members of the Fos and Jun families and
that are guided by activity-dependent processes.

CRF stimulates expression of multiple fos and jun related genes in the AtT-20
corticotroph cell.

Autelitano DJ(1), Cohen DR.

(1)Baker Medical Research Institute, Prahran, Victoria, Australia.

Recent studies have shown that corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) stimulates
c-fos gene expression in the AtT-20 corticotroph cell line, and that
overexpression of c-Fos results in activation of POMC gene transcription. Since
transactivation by c-Fos requires dimerization with a Jun family member to form
the active transcription factor AP-1, we have examined the expression of multiple
fos and jun related genes and have correlated their expression with AP-1 DNA
binding activity in AtT-20 nuclear extracts after stimulation with CRF. Although 
basal expression of c-fos mRNA was extremely low, it was rapidly and transiently 
stimulated in AtT-20 cells following administration of either constant or a
single pulse of CRF. In contrast, basal expression of c-jun mRNA was slightly
higher and underwent little or no change in response to CRF. Specific
ribonuclease protection analysis showed that in addition to c-fos, mRNA
transcripts encoding fos B and jun B were rapidly stimulated in response to CRF, 
though levels of induced fos B mRNA were 20-40 times lower than c-fos or jun B,
respectively. Gel shift analysis demonstrated that CRF caused a sustained
increase in AP-1 DNA binding to both a canonical AP-1 element as well as to the
POMC exon-1 AP-1 site. Studies with specific antisera directed against c-Fos
revealed that although no c-Fos could be detected in AP-1 complexes in basal cell
extracts, c-Fos became a prominent component of AP-1 following CRF stimulation,
reaching maximal levels by 4 h. Despite the fact that AP-1 DNA binding activity
remained elevated for at least 24 h after CRF, c-Fos was most prominent during
the early phase of the response. Similarly, JunB was shown to be a major
component of AP-1 DNA binding activity in CRF-stimulated AtT-20 nuclear extracts 
that persisted for at least 24h after stimulation. Despite the obvious induction 
of fos B mRNA in response to CRF, FosB protein was not detected in DNA bound AP-1
complexes. These data demonstrate that CRF is a potent stimulus for corticotroph 
expression of c-fos, jun B and fos B, and suggest that the subsequent increase in
AP-1 may play a role in activation of gene expression and/or as a modulator of
glucocorticoid receptor function.

Oncology, Princeton, New Jersey 08543-4000, USA.

FosB, one of the members of the Fos family, is rapidly induced in many cell types
upon stimulation and has a stimulatory effect on the proliferation of cultured
cells. To understand the tissue distribution of FosB, we have studied its
expression pattern by immunohistochemistry in newborn and late embryonic stage
mice. These results show that FosB is widely expressed with the highest levels of
expression observed in both bony and cartilagenous regions of developing bone.
FosB is also detected within whisker follicles, liver, and epidermal tissue. To
study the role of FosB in mammalian development we generated embryonic stem (ES) 
cells, mice and mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) that are deficient for FosB. FosB
-/- mice are born at a normal frequency, are fertile and present no obvious
phenotypic or histologic abnormalities. FosB-deficient ES cells and MEFs
proliferate and enter the S phase normally and we do not find upregulation of
other fos family genes to compensate for the lack of FosB. However, we do find
that the induction of two AP-1 containing genes is reduced after stimulation of
FosB-deficient cells, demonstrating that FosB does indeed play a functional role 
in transcriptional regulation.

Differential induction of fos and jun family genes by thyrotropin in rat thyroid 
FRTL-5 cells.

Effect of thyrotropin (TSH) on the expression of the members of fos and jun
family genes in a rat thyroid cell line (FRTL-5) was examined by the reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. FRTL-5 cells were
maintained in a TSH-deprived medium for 5 days. After 1 mU/mL TSH addition, the
cells were harvested at intervals. Total RNA extracted from the cells was
subjected to RT-PCR. TSH induced a rapid and transient expression of c-fos, fosB,
and fra-1 with different kinetics. Increase in c-fos mRNA was most rapid with a
peak level at 30 min after TSH addition. The fosB mRNA reached a peak level at 60
min poststimulation with a rapid decline at 90 min. The fra-1 mRNA increased at
60 min followed by a gradual decrease until 120 min. The change in fra-2 mRNA
level was similar to that of fra-1. TSH induced similar changes in the levels of 
c-jun and junB mRNAs. They significantly increased within 30 min followed by a
sustained high level until 90 min. The differential induction of fos and jun
family genes suggests an important role of their gene products on the regulation 
of thyroid cell function by TSH.

Induction of chronic Fos-related antigens in rat brain by chronic morphine
administration.

Nye HE(1), Nestler EJ.

Author information:

Connecticut, USA.

Previous studies have shown that repeated exposure to cocaine or to several other
stimuli induces novel 35-37 kDa Fos-related antigens (chronic Fras) in specific
brain regions. Induction of these proteins is associated with prolonged increases
in AP-1 DNA binding activity that parallel the long half-life of the chronic Fras
in brain. In the current study, we characterized regulation of the chronic Fras
in response to prolonged exposure to morphine. After 5 days of morphine
treatment, we observed increased levels of the chronic Fras and of AP-1 binding
activity in rat striatum and nucleus accumbens, effects that were not seen in
most other brain regions that we studied. Concomitant administration of
naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist, prevented the induction of these
proteins. Two-dimensional gel analysis showed that the chronic Fras induced by
chronic morphine administration are identical to those induced after chronic
cocaine and other treatments. A time course study indicated that chronic Fra
induction was first apparent after 3 days of morphine treatment and peaked
between 5 and 7 days of treatment in both the striatum and nucleus accumbens.
Withdrawal studies demonstrated robust induction of several known acute Fras,
including c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2, and delta FosB, at 6 hr after naltrexone
precipitation of withdrawal in the striatum, nucleus accumbens, and several other
brain regions. Levels of these proteins returned to basal values by 72 hr. In
contrast, no further induction of the chronic Fras was evident after 6 hr of
withdrawal in the striatum and nucleus accumbens, but levels of the proteins
increased beyond their already elevated chronic morphine values after longer
periods (72 hr) of withdrawal, even though physical withdrawal symptoms had
resolved at this time point. Chronic Fras were also induced after these prolonged
withdrawal periods in several other brain regions, where the proteins were not
induced by chronic morphine alone. We discuss the possible roles played by the
chronic Fras in the adaptive responses of the brain to chronic opiate exposure
and opiate withdrawal.

Using an antibody that recognizes the products of all known members of the fos
family of immediate early genes, it was demonstrated that destruction of the
nigrostriatal pathway by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the medial
forebrain bundle produces a prolonged (>3 months) elevation of Fos-like
immunoreactivity in the striatum. Using retrograde tract tracing techniques, we
have previously shown that this increase in Fos-like immunoreactivity is located 
predominantly in striatal neurons that project to the globus pallidus. In the
present study, Western blots were performed on nuclear extracts from the intact
and denervated striatum of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats to determine the nature of
Fos-immunoreactive protein(s) responsible for this increase. Approximately 6
weeks after the 6-OHDA lesion, expression of two Fos-related antigens with
apparent molecular masses of 43 and 45 kDa was enhanced in the denervated
striatum. Chronic haloperidol administration also selectively elevated expression
of these Fos-related antigens, suggesting that their induction after dopaminergic
denervation is mediated by reduced activation of D2-like dopamine receptors.
Western blot immunostaining using an antibody which recognizes the N-terminus of 
FosB indicated that the 43 and 45 kDa Fos-related antigens induced by
dopaminergic denervation and chronic haloperidol administration may be related to
a truncated form of FosB known as deltaFosB. Consistent with this proposal,
retrograde tracing experiments confirmed that deltaFosB-like immunoreactivity in 
the deafferented striatum was located predominantly in striatopallidal neurons.
Gel shift experiments demonstrated that elevated AP-1 binding activity in
denervated striata contained FosB-like protein(s), suggesting that enhanced
deltaFosB levels may mediate some of the effects of prolonged dopamine depletion 
on AP-1-regulated genes in striatopallidal neurons. In contrast, chronic
administration of the D1-like receptor agonist CY 208243 to 6-OHDA-lesioned rats 
dramatically enhanced deltaFosB-like immunoreactivity in striatal neurons
projecting to the substantia nigra. Western blot immunostaining revealed that
deltaFosB and, to a lesser extent, FosB are elevated by chronic D1-like agonist
administration. Both the quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction and the ribonuclease protection assay demonstrated that deltafosB mRNA
levels were substantially enhanced in the denervated striatum by chronic D1-like 
agonist administration. Lastly, we examined the effects of chronic administration
ofD1-like and D2-like dopamine receptor agonists on striatal deltaFosB expression
in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) primate model of
Parkinson's disease. In monkeys rendered Parkinsonian by MPTP, there was a modest
increase in deltaFosB-like protein(s), while the development of dyskinesia
produced by chronic D1-like agonist administration was accompanied by large
increases in DeltaFosB-like protein(s). In contrast, administration of the
long-acting D2-like agonist cabergoline, which alleviated Parkinsonian symptoms
without producing dyskinesia reduced deltaFosB levels to near normal. Taken
together, these results demonstrate that chronic alterations in dopaminergic
neurotransmission produce a persistent elevation of deltaFosB-like protein(s) in 
both the rodent and primate striatum.

Defective thymocyte proliferation and IL-2 production in transgenic mice
expressing a dominant-negative form of CREB.

The basic/leucine zipper (bZip) transcription factor, CREB, binds to the CRE
element (TGANNTCA). The transcriptional activity of CREB requires phosphorylation
of the protein on a serine residue at position 119 (ref. 6). CREs are present in 
a number of T-cell genes but the precise role of CREB in T-cell differentiation
and function was unknown. Here we show that resting thymocytes contain
predominantly unphosphorylated (inactive) CREB, which is rapidly activated by
phosphorylation on Ser 119 following thymocyte activation. T-cell development is 
normal in transgenic mice that express a dominant-negative form of CREB
(CREBA119, with alanine at position 119) under the control of the T-cell-specific
CD2 promoter/enhancer. In contrast, thymocytes and T cells from these animals
display a profound proliferative defect characterized by markedly decreased
interleukin-2 production, G1 cell-cycle arrest and subsequent apoptotic death in 
response to a number of different activation signals. This proliferative defect
is associated with the markedly reduced induction of c-jun, c-fos, Fra-2 and FosB
following activation of the CREBA119 transgenic thymocytes. We propose that
T-cell activation leads to the phosphorylation and activation of CREB, which in
turn is required for normal induction of the transcription factor AP1 and
subsequent interleukin-2 production and cell-cycle progression.

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) generates circadian rhythms of behavior and
hormone secretion in mammals, and integrates responses to light and nonphotic
stimuli to synchronize such rhythms with the external environment. Previous
studies have demonstrated a close association between the induction of the
immediate early gene (IEG) c-fos in the SCN by light and phase shifts of
circadian rhythms induced by light, but nonphotic stimuli (e.g., arousal), which 
also cause phase shifts, do not increase c-fos expression in the SCN. Because
c-fos is now known to be a member of a large family of IEGs which can regulate
transcription and thus cellular function, the aim of the current study was to
determine whether induction of another member of this immediate early gene
family, fosB, is associated with photic and nonphotic phase shifts. An antiserum 
that recognizes a unique peptide sequence derived from FosB was produced so that 
the expression of fosB could be investigated in cells within the SCN by
immunocytochemical detection of its protein product. The regional distribution of
FosB-immunoreactive (ir) cells in the SCN of Syrian and Siberian hamsters was
broadly similar to that for c-Fos-ir cells. However, whereas c-fos expression in 
the SCN was constitutively low, but could be massively induced by light at
particular circadian phases, FosB-ir cells were present at all circadian phases
studied, irrespective of photic stimulation, and light only produced marginal
increases in the number of FosB-ir cells compared with nonstimulated controls.
Moreover, blockade of glutamatergic neurotransmission by pretreatment of hamsters
with the NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 significantly reduced photic induction of
c-Fos-ir cells, but did not influence the number of FosB-ir cells in the SCN.
Finally, an arousing nonphotic stimulus known to cause phase advances in
wheel-running behavior in Syrian hamsters did not alter significantly the number 
of FosB-ir cells in the SCN. These observations indicate that light and nonphotic
stimuli are not potent regulators of fosB expression in the SCN. However, because
fosB and c-fos can be present in the SCN at the same time after a light pulse,
these studies indicate the potential for interactions with each other and with
members of the Jun family in the regulation of the circadian timing system.

We have examined the patterns of expression of members of the fos and jun
families of transcription factors during murine postnatal intestinal development.
Northern analysis showed increases in fosB, c-fos, and junB mRNA levels in both
proximal jejunum and colon. These increases coincide with weaning a period of
major changes in intestinal cell proliferation and migration. Administration of
dexamethasone to suckling mice resulted in transient induction of c-fos mRNA
levels in all gut segments. Thus, modifications in expression of certain members 
of the fos and jun families in vivo correlate with major maturational changes
during murine intestinal development and support a role for these transcription
factors in the regulation of intestinal functions.

Activator protein 1 (AP1) family proteins have been implicated in the regulation 
of genes expressed in the epidermis. However, no comprehensive analysis of the
expression patterns of the known AP1 family proteins in the human epidermis or
any other terminally differentiating tissue has been performed. In the present
study we describe the localization of c-fos, fosB, Fra-1, Fra-2, c-jun, junB and 
junD in the normal human epidermis. Each is expressed in specific epidermal
layers. c-fos is localized in the nuclei of the upper spinous and granular layer 
cells. FosB is present in the nuclei in all layers. Fra-1 is absent from the
basal layer, but is present in all other layers. Fra-2 is detected in all layers,
but staining intensity is increased in the upper spinous layer. c-jun staining is
limited to the granular layer, while junB and junD are present in all layers. The
differentiation-dependent pattern of expression of the AP1 family members suggest
an important role for these proteins in specifying the temporal and spatial
pattern of gene expression during keratinocyte differentiation.

This review tries to survey the expression patterns of inducible transcription
factors (ITFs) of the Jun (c-Jun, JunB, JunD) and Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra) families
as well as of zinc finger proteins (Krox-20 and Krox-24) and their mRNAs
following ischemia, epileptic seizures, hypoglycemia, axotomy and(programmed)
neuronal death in the mammalian brain. Jun and Fos proteins or Jun/Fos-containing
transcription complexes are also termed as AP-I proteins or AP-1 complexes. So
far, however, the genes encoding for Jun, Fos and Krox proteins have been
included into the rather heterogeneous pool of immediate-early genes (IEGs).
Therefore, we suggest the term 'inducible transcription factors' (ITF) with
regard to their main functional features: (rapid) inducibility and control of
transcription. In the first part of the review, we summarize the current
knowledge on the organization and control of the jun, fos and krox promoters as
well as about the molecular down-stream effects of their proteins. In the
sections on general and focal ischemia, epileptic seizures and hypoglycemia. the 
review is focused on the formation of specific expression patterns that is the
individual temporo-spatial expression of different ITFs following the same
pathophysiological stimulus. Particular emphasis is put on the correlation of ITF
expression with vulnerability and resistance of specific neuronal subpopulations.
Furthermore, we have also reviewed the DNA-binding activity of AP-1 proteins in
the adult rat brain and the pool of putative effector proteins following the
above-mentioned stimulation paradigms. Subsequently, the less defined role of
ITFs in the process of (programmed) neuronal death is discussed. The last section
surveys the prolonged and selective expression of c-Jun in axotomized neurons and
its relation to the expression of nitric oxide synthase.

Elevated AP-1 transcription factor DNA binding activity at the onset of
functional plasticity during development of rat sensory cortical areas.

Author information: 
(1)Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Warsaw, Poland.

The patterns of three transcription factor DNA binding activities, namely AP-1,
Octamer and CREB, were examined in barrel and visual cortices of rat brain during
early postnatal development, when activity-dependent plasticity of neuronal
responses and connectivity was described. Main peak levels of AP-1 DNA binding
activity have been observed at 21 days postnatally in both cortical areas. In
addition, slightly elevated AP-1 levels were detected at 3-7 postnatal days in
the barrel and in the visual cortex. In contrast, Octamer DNA binding activities 
were at the highest levels in both areas at 7 days postnatally, and CREB DNA
binding activities were not appreciably modulated throughout the development. The
AP-1 protein complex at 21 days postnatally was composed of JunD, JunB, Fra-2,
FosB and to much lesser extent of c-Fos in both cortical areas. Treatment of 21
day old rats with MK-801, an NMDA receptor antagonist, provoked a dramatic
decrease in AP-1 DNA binding activities in the barrel cortex, but not in the
visual cortex. Elevated AP-1 DNA binding activity can be taken as a good
correlate of an onset of functional plasticity in the rat sensory cortex,
although in the two primary sensory cortices examined it seems to be regulated in
different ways.

Previous work has shown that c-Fos and several Fos-like proteins or Fras
(Fos-related antigens) are induced acutely in brain in response to a wide variety
of stimuli. In contrast, several stimuli induce apparently distinct Fos-like
proteins, termed chronic Fras, after chronic administration. We show that delta
FosB, a truncated splice variant of FosB, responds like the other acute Fras: it 
is induced rapidly and transiently in cerebral cortex after acute
electroconvulsive seizure (ECS) and in striatum after acute cocaine but does not 
accumulate after chronic ECS or cocaine treatment. Although the chronic Fras are 
immunochemically related to delta FosB, they can be distinguished from delta FosB
based on their temporal properties in that they are induced after chronic ECS and
cocaine treatments only. Moreover, the chronic Fras and delta FosB can be
distinguished by their migration patterns on one- and two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis. The chronic Fras, therefore, appear to be novel FosB-related
proteins. We also provide evidence that the chronic Fras heterodimerize primarily
with Jun-D and Jun-B, as opposed to c-Jun. The possibility that AP-1 complexes
containing the chronic Fras function as negative regulators of AP-1 mediated
transcription is discussed.

Stimulation of ionotropic glutamate receptors activates transcription factor
NF-kappa B in primary neurons.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Biochemistry, Albert-Ludwigs-University, Freiburg, Germany.

L-Glutamate is the most common excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and plays
a crucial role in neuronal plasticity as well as in neurotoxicity. While a large 
body of literature describes the induction of immediate-early genes, including
c-fos, fosB, c-jun, junB, zif/268, and krox genes by glutamate and agonists in
neurons, very little is known about preexisting transcription factors controlling
the induction of such genes. This prompted us to investigate whether stimulation 
of glutamate receptors can activate NF-kappa B, which is present in neurons in
either inducible or constitutive form. Here we report that brief treatments with 
kainate or high potassium strongly activated NF-kappa B in granule cells from rat
cerebellum. This was detected at the single cell level by immunostaining with a
monoclonal antibody that selectively reacts with the transcriptionally active,
nuclear form of NF-kappa B p65. The activation of NF-kappa B could be blocked
with the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, suggesting the involvement of
reactive oxygen intermediates. The data may explain the kainate-induced cell
surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, which
are encoded by genes known to be controlled by NF-kappa B. Moreover, NF-kappa B
activity was found to change dramatically in neurons during development of the
cerebellum between days 5 and 7 after birth.

Biphasic expression of the fos and jun families of transcription factors
following transient forebrain ischaemia in the rat. Effect of hypothermia.

Kamme F(1), Campbell K, Wieloch T.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory for Experimental Brain Research, University of Lund, Lund
University Hospital, Sweden.

Transient global ischaemia induces the expression of immediate early genes. Using
in situ hybridization, the expression of c-fos, fosB, fra-1, fra-2, c-jun and
junB was studied after 15 min of normothermic and hypothermic (33 degrees C)
transient forebrain ischaemia in the rat, induced by common carotid occlusion
combined with systemic hypotension. Two phases of induction of the immediate
early genes were observed. The early phase, peaking at 1-2 h of reperfusion, was 
dominated by marked expression in the dentate gyrus. The second phase, with
maximal expression at 12-36 h of reperfusion, was observed particularly in the
vulnerable CA1 and CA3 regions. Hypothermia increased the early induction of one 
of the genes studied, signifying a differential effect of hypothermia upon the
signal transduction mechanisms activating these genes. The late induction
occurred earlier after hypothermic than after normothermic ischaemia. The early
expression of immediate early genes is due to the rapid activation of cytosolic
response elements caused by the ischaemic insult. We suggest that the late
induction is a stress signal for activation of repair processes, analogous to the
cellular response seen after UV light-induced DNA damage. The relatively fast
induction of the immediate early genes following hypothermic ischaemia may

Membrane immunoglobulin receptor cross-linking induces fosB mRNA expression in
mature B lymphocytes: assembly of distinct FosB-containing nucleoprotein
complexes during B cell stimulation.

USA.

We demonstrate herein that anti-Ig stimulation of Bal-17 B cells leads to a rapid
and transient increase in fosB mRNA levels, with kinetics similar to those
previously reported for members of the jun gene family. The coupling of fosB
expression to known protein kinases that are activated following membrane
immunoglobulin receptor (mIg) cross-linking was evaluated. Inhibition of
src-protein tyrosine kinase activity by pretreatment of Bal-17 B cells with
herbimycin A prevented subsequent anti-Ig-dependent increases in fosB mRNA
levels. Moreover, inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) by pretreatment of Bal-17 
B cells with staurosporine, H7, or by phorbol ester-induced down-regulation of
PKC activity blocked anti-Ig-stimulated fosB gene expression. These findings
suggest that fosB expression is coupled to a mIg-mediated pathway that utilizes
activated src-protein tyrosine kinases and PKC. Immunoblotting of Bal-17 B cell
extracts with anti-FosB antiserum revealed that mIg cross-linking results in an
increase in FosB protein levels. Moreover, immunoprecipitation of nondenatured
Bal-17 B cell extracts indicated that FosB forms complexes in vivo with JunB and 
JunD and to a lesser extent with cJun. The anti-Ig-induced FosB/Jun complexes
bind to several distinct cis-acting DNA elements, including AP-1 and NF-AB, which
have been implicated in regulating nuclear gene expression during B cell
activation. Collectively, these results suggest that FosB plays a central role in
regulating gene expression during anti-Ig-mediated B cell activation.

Transcriptional activation of the fra-1 gene by AP-1 is mediated by regulatory
sequences in the first intron.

Constitutive expression of c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, or c-Jun in rat fibroblasts leads 
to up-regulation of the immediate-early gene fra-1. Using the posttranslational
FosER induction system, we demonstrate that this AP-1-dependent stimulation of
fra-1 expression is rapid, depends on a functional DNA-binding domain of FosER,
and is a general phenomenon observed in different cell types. In vitro
mutagenesis and functional analysis of the rat fra-1 gene in stably transfected
Rat-1A-FosER fibroblasts indicated that basal and AP-1-regulated expression of
the fra-1 gene depends on regulatory sequences in the first intron which comprise
a consensus AP-1 site and two AP-1-like elements. We have also investigated the
transactivating and transforming properties of the Fra-1 protein to address the
significance of fra-1 up-regulation. The entire Fra-1 protein fused to the
DNA-binding domain of Ga14 is shown to lack any transactivation function, and yet
it possesses oncogenic potential, as overexpression of Fra-1 in established rat
fibroblasts results in anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumor
development in athymic mice, fra-1 is therefore not only induced by members of
the Fos family, but its gene product may also contribute to cellular
transformation by these proteins. Together, these data identify fra-1 as a unique
member of the fos gene family which is under positive control by AP-1 activity.

C-fos mediates antipsychotic-induced neurotensin gene expression in the rodent
striatum.

Ontario, Canada.

The ubiquitous inducibility of the immediate-early gene c-fos in the central
nervous system has led to the search for downstream genes which are regulated by 
its product, Fos. Recent evidence suggests that c-fos induction by a single
injection of the classical antipsychotic haloperidol may contribute to the
subsequent increase in neurotensin gene expression in the rodent striatum.
Consistent with this proposal, in the present study haloperidol-induced Fos-like 
immunoreactivity and neurotensin/neuromedin N messenger RNA were found to be
expressed by the same population of striatal neurons. Moreover, inhibition of
haloperidol-induced c-fos expression by intrastriatal injection of antisense
phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides complimentary either to bases 109-126 or
127-144 of c-fos attenuated the subsequent increase in neurotensin/neuromedin N
messenger RNA. However, injection of a sense phosphorothioate
oligodeoxynucleotide corresponding to bases 127-144 of c-fos did not reduce
haloperidol-induced c-fos or neurotensin/neuromedin N expression. Furthermore,
constitutive expression of Jun-like immunoreactivity in the striatum was not
reduced by either the sense or antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides. 
Similarly, the sense and antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide failed
to reduce proenkephalin messenger RNA, which is located in the same striatal
neurons that express haloperidol-induced neurotensin/neuromedin N messenger RNA, 
which is located in the same striatal neurons that express haloperidol-induced
neurotensin/neuromedin N messenger RNA. Lastly, haloperidol-induced increases in 
nerve growth factor I-A-, JunB- and FosB-like immunoreactivity and fosB messenger
RNA were not decreased by intrastriatal injection of either the sense or
antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides. These results indicate that the
antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides attenuated haloperidol-induced
neurotensin/neuromedin N expression by selectively reducing c-fos expression and 
emphasize the potential importance of immediate-early gene induction in the
mechanism of action of this antipsychotic drug.

Antitumor promotion by phenolic antioxidants: inhibition of AP-1 activity through
induction of Fra expression.

Induction of phase 2 detoxification enzymes by phenolic antioxidants can account 
for prevention of tumor initiation but cannot explain why these compounds inhibit
tumor promotion. Phase 2 genes are induced through an antioxidant response
element (ARE). Although the ARE resembles an AP-1 binding site, we show that the 
major ARE binding and activating protein is not AP-1. Interestingly, AP-1 DNA
binding activity was induced by the phenolic antioxidant tert-butylhydroquinone
(BHQ), but the induction of AP-1 transcriptional activity by the tumor promoter
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) was inhibited by this compound. BHQ
induced expression of c-jun, junB, fra-1, and fra-2, which encode AP-1
components, but was a poor inducer of c-fos and had no effect on fosB. Like c-Fos
and FosB, the Fra proteins heterodimerize with Jun proteins to form stable AP-1
complexes. However, Fra-containing AP-1 complexes have low transactivation
potential. Furthermore, Fra-1 repressed AP-1 activity induced by either TPA or
expression of c-Jun and c-Fos. We therefore conclude that inhibitory AP-1
complexes composed of Jun-Fra heterodimers, induced by BHQ, antagonize the
transcriptional effects of the tumor promoter TPA, which are mediated by Jun-Fos 
heterodimers. Since AP-1 is an important mediator of tumor promoter action, these
findings may explain the anti-tumor-promoting activity of phenolic antioxidants.

Axotomy-induced regulation of c-Jun expression in regenerating rat retinal
ganglion cells.

Robinson GA(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Physiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC
27599, USA.

Antibodies to c-Jun, JunD, JunB, c-Fos, FosB and Krox-24 proteins were used to
examine the expression of these transcription factors in identified adult rat
retinal ganglion cells with regenerating axons in a peripheral nerve graft.
First, expression in ganglion cells 1 month after graft placement was compared to
expression in these neurons 5 to 6 months after grafting. Whereas strong c-Jun
expression was seen in most ganglion cells one month after grafting, most 5- to
6-month ganglion cells showed only basal expression. The maintained nucleolar
expression of FosB in both ganglion cell groups was the only other transcription 
factor seen. Second, transcription factor expression was examined in these short-
and long-term regenerating neurons after a second axotomy caused by graft
transection and compared to the effects of a single axotomy on expression in
non-regenerating ganglion cells. Only c-Jun was re-expressed in the regenerating 
ganglion cells after re-axotomy.

NMDA receptor-dependent and -independent immediate early gene expression induced 
by focal mechanical brain injury.

Belluardo N(1), Mudò G, Dell'Albani P, Jiang XH, Condorelli DF.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Human Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Catania,
Italy.

In the present study we analysed, by in situ hybridization, the effects of an
extremely localized mechanical brain injury, obtained by the simple needle
insertion (30 g) in rat hippocampus or cortex, on the expression of several
immediate early genes (c-fos, fosB, c-jun, junB, junD, zif/268). When the needle 
is deepened into the hippocampus through the cortex, a simultaneous ipsilateral
activation of all examined IEGs is observed in both the cerebral cortex and in
the dentate gyrus of hippocampus. Maximal effects are detected between 30 and 60 
min with the following rank order of induction: zif/268 > c-fos- > junB > fosB > 
c-jun > junD. On the other hand, when the penetration of the needle is limited to
the cerebral cortex the activation of the IEGs (c-fos, fosB, junB and zif/268)
spreads throughout the ipsilateral cortex but does not involve the hippocampal
region. Systemic administration of ketamine, a non-competitive antagonist of
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, blocks IEG expression induced by brain
injury in the cerebral cortex and in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Pretreatment 
with the anticonvulsant diazepam, the anaesthetic urethane, or the muscarinic
receptor antagonist scopolamine do not affect the injury-induced genomic
response. An important regional difference in the sensitivity to the blocking
effect of ketamine can be observed analysing the results regarding the zif/268
gene expression in the hippocampus. A clear induction of this gene by needle
insertion can be detected both in the dentate gyrus and in the hippocampal
layers. However, the dentate gyrus induction is completely blocked by the
ketamine pretreatment, while the induction in the hippocampal layers is not
affected by this NMDA antagonist. The zif/268 induction in the hippocampal layers
is not blocked even if the intracerebroventricular administration of a non-NMDA
glutamate receptor antagonist is associated to the systemic pretreatment with
ketamine. This result represents the first observation of injury-induced neuronal
genomic responses that are not critically dependent on the NMDA receptor
activity.

Stabilization of cyclin E and cdk2 mRNAs at G1/S transition in Rat-1A cells
emerging from the G0 state.

Oda S(1), Nishida J, Nakabeppu Y, Sekiguchi M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.

mRNAs for cyclin E and Cdk2 have a role in the commitment to DNA replication in
the cell cycle, and are induced in Rat-1A cells by serum stimulation. Cyclin E
and cdk2 genes are transcribed in quiescent cells, but their transcripts rapidly 
turn over and levels are kept low. The rate of transcription of the cdk2 gene is 
slightly increased after serum stimulation, while that of cyclin E is fairly
constant. At the G1/S transition of serum-stimulated cells, transient
stabilization of the two types of mRNAs occurs, an event which may lead to
induction of each mRNA. Artificial expression of an immediate-early protein delta
FosB results in proliferation of quiescent Rat-1A cells, and this is accompanied 
by an efficient induction of cyclin E and cdk2 mRNAs. In delta FosB-expressing
cells, two types of mRNAs are stabilized to the same extent seen in
serum-stimulated cells. The expression of cyclin E and cdk2 genes is upregulated 
by stabilization of their transcripts, at least in part. We propose that delta
FosB may have a role in regulation of progression of the cell cycle in
serum-stimulated Rat-1A cells by triggering stabilization of mRNAs for cyclin E
and Cdk2.

Receptor-specific induction of individual AP-1 components in B lymphocytes.

Huo L(1), Rothstein TL.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, Boston University Medical Center, MA 02118.

The inducible nuclear transcription factor complex, AP-1, typically consists of
heterodimers between Jun and Fos proteins. Although components are drawn from
families of related molecules, little is known about the physiologic regulation
of jun- and fos-related gene products. In particular, it is not known whether
expression of individual family members is stimulus-specific or whether the same 
signaling pathways are responsible for induction of all subunits. To clarify
these issues, AP-1 components were examined following activation of primary B
lymphocytes through two separate receptors, the surface Ig Ag receptor, and the
CD40 receptor for T cell influences. Both forms of stimulation led to expression 
of JunB and JunD mRNA and protein; however, induction of JunB mediated by anti-Ig
Ab was protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent, whereas induction mediated by CD40
ligand was resistant to PKC depletion. The two forms of stimulation diverged even
further with respect to Fos expression. Although both stimuli induced c-Fos,
expression of FosB was stimulus specific at both the mRNA and protein levels, in 
that this component was induced by anti-Ig but not by CD40 ligand. Stimulated
expression of c-Fos and FosB was in all cases PKC-independent. These results
provide evidence for receptor-specific differences in the expression of AP-1
components, primarily with respect to FosB. They also indicate that separate
intracellular pathways may be used for induction of jun and fos gene products and
that the same transcription factor (junB) may be triggered by two surface
receptors through separate pathways that differ in PKC dependence.

Basal expression of the inducible transcription factors c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos,
FosB, and Krox-24 in the adult rat brain.

Herdegen T(1), Kovary K, Buhl A, Bravo R, Zimmermann M, Gass P.

Jun, Fos, and Krox proteins are inducible transcription factors contributing to
the control of gene expression. The elucidation of their individual expression
patterns in the nervous system provides new insights into the ability of neurons 
to react with changes of gene expression to external stimulation under
physiological or pathological conditions. The expression of c-Jun, JunB, JunD,
c-Fos, FosB, and Krox-24 was investigated in the brain of untreated male
Sprague-Dawley and female BDIX rats by immunocytochemistry using specific
antibodies. JunD immunoreactivity (IR) labeled the highest number of neurons,
being present in almost all neurons of the brain. JunD was expressed at high
levels in those areas that also exhibit c-Jun, JunB, c-Fos, and FosB-IR, such as 
locus coeruleus, periolivary nuclei (ncl.), pontine and central gray, lateral
lemniscal ncl., inferior and superior colliculi, leaflet of geniculate ncl.,
midline nuclei of thalamus, dorsomedial and paraventricular ncl. of hypothalamus,
ncl. supraopticus, dorsolateral part of caudate putamen and lateral septal ncl.
In contrast to the high number of JunD-positive neurons, c-Jun, JunB, c-Fos, and 
FosB proteins were detected in rather low numbers of neurons in these brain
areas; the rank of the number of immunopositive neurons was c-Fos > JunB > c-Jun 
> FosB. Particularly high levels of expression were observed for c-Jun in
medullary motoneurons, medial geniculate ncl., arcuate ncl., and dentate gyrus,
and for JunB in the CA-1 area of the hippocampus and islands of Calleja. The zinc
finger protein Krox-24 was expressed in many neurons of these brain areas, with
only discrete Jun- and Fos-IR; additionally, many intensely labeled nuclei were
present in spinal ncl. of the trigeminal ventromedial ncl. of the hypothalamus
and the CA-1 area of the hippocampus. In the cerebellum, nuclear labeling was
detected only for c-Jun, JunD, and Krox-24 in granule cells. JunD-IR was also
found in glial cells of gray matter and fiber tracts, whereas glial c-Jun-IR was 
observed only in fiber tracts. Apart from a weak JunD-IR, some areas did not
express Jun, Fos, and Krox proteins such as cuneate and gracile ncl.,
venterobasal complex of thalamus, globus pallidum, and Purkinje cells of the
cerebellum. Our data indicate that inducible transcription factors of the fos,
jun, and krox gene families show patterns of individual expression in untreated
animals, thereby reflecting different mechanisms and/or thresholds for induction 
under physiological conditions.

Block of c-Fos and JunB expression by antisense oligonucleotides inhibits
light-induced phase shifts of the mammalian circadian clock.

Light-induced phase shifts of circadian rhythmic locomotor activity are
associated with the expression of c-Jun, JunB, c-Fos and FosB transcription
factors in the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus, as shown in the present study. In
order to explore the importance of c-Fos and JunB, the predominantly expressed
AP-1 proteins for the phase-shifting effects of light, we blocked the expression 
of c-Fos and JunB in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of male rats, housed under
constant darkness, by intracerebroventricular application of 2 microliters of 1
mM antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (ASO) specifically directed
against c-fos and junB mRNA. A light pulse (300 lux for 1 h) at circadian time 15
induced a significant phase shift (by 125 +/- 15 min) of the circadian locomotor 
activity rhythm, whereas application of ASO 6 h before the light pulse completely
prevented this phase shift. Application of control nonsense oligodeoxynucleotides
had no effect. ASO strongly reduced the light-induced expression of c-Fos and
JunB proteins. In contrast, light pulses with or without the control nonsense
oligodeoxynucleotides evoked strong nuclear c-Fos and JunB immunoreactivity in
the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus. These results demonstrate for the first time
that inducible transcription factors such as c-Fos and JunB are an essential part
of fundamental biological processes in the adult mammalian nervous system, e.g.
of light-induced phase shifts of the circadian pacemaker.

Angiotensin II induces a complex activation of transcription factors in the rat
brain: expression of Fos, Jun and Krox proteins.

Lebrun CJ(1), Blume A, Herdegen T, Seifert K, Bravo R, Unger T.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmacology, University of Heidelberg, Germany.

We investigated the effects of intracerebroventricular injection of angiotensin
II on neuronal immediate early gene-encoded protein synthesis in the brain of
conscious rats. The expression of seven immediate early gene-encoded
transcription factors (c-Fos, FosB, c-Jun, JunB, JunD, Krox-20 (Egr-2) and
Krox-24 (NGFI-A, Egr-1, Zif/268) was assessed simultaneously. Angiotensin II (1, 
10, 100 ng) induced a dose-dependent expression of c-Fos and Krox-24 in the
subfornical organ, the median preoptic area and in the paraventricular nucleus
and supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus, regions known to be involved in the
central osmoregulatory and neuroendocrine actions of angiotensin II. FosB
expression was induced four hours after icv injection of the highest dose of
angiotensin II in the median preoptic area and paraventricular nucleus, c-Jun
expression was restricted to the median preoptic area, subfornical organ and
paraventricular nucleus, and JunB was only induced in the median preoptic area
and subfornical organ. In these above mentioned regions, JunD exhibited a high
basal staining, which was not visibly altered by angiotensin II. Krox-20 was not 
induced by angiotensin II. Intracerebroventricular injections of isotonic saline 
did not induce immediate early gene expression in any of the above brain areas.
The angiotensin II-AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan, applied
intracerebroventricular five minutes prior to angiotensin II, prevented the
angiotensin II-induced immediate early gene protein expression. Losartan alone
had no effects on immediate early gene expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors are critical for mediating the effects of

The mechanisms by which activation of excitatory amino acid receptors is coupled 
to the regulation of gene transcription were studied using cultured hippocampal
neurons from neonatal rats. Voltage recording, calcium imaging, specific RNA
analysis and immunocytochemistry were carried out on sister cultures. This
allowed analysis of the expression of functional glutamate receptor subtypes,
examination of their role in controlling intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i),
and determination of their relative contributions to the transcriptional
regulation of six immediate early genes c-fos, fosB, c-jun, junB, zif/268 (also
termed Egr-1; NGFI-A; Krox-24) and nur/77 (also termed NGFI-B). Expression of all
six immediate early genes was induced in hippocampal neurons by glutamate
treatment. Nuclear run-on assays demonstrated that this induction occurred at the
transcriptional level. Activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of
glutamate receptor was necessary and sufficient for the transcriptional response.
Non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, while present in cultured hippocampal
neurons, contributed relatively little to the regulation of transcription.
Calcium imaging showed that glutamate-induced changes in [Ca2+]i were almost
entirely mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, rather than by L-type
voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Previous studies have shown that stimulation 
with selective agonists of either N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors,
non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, or L-type calcium channels can lead to an
increase in [Ca2+]i and c-fos expression. Here we demonstrate that in our
hippocampal culture system glutamate controls [Ca2+]i and induces immediate early
gene transcription primarily by activating N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.

An inhibitor domain in c-Fos regulates activation domains containing the HOB1
motif.

Brown HJ(1), Sutherland JA, Cook A, Bannister AJ, Kouzarides T.

Author information: 
(1)Wellcome/CRC Institute, Cambridge, UK.

The c-Fos protein has three activation modules at its C-terminus, two of which
contain motifs (HOB1 and HOB2) which are also present in the activation domains
of c-Jun. Here we show the existence of two additional activation modules at the 
N-terminus of c-Fos, one of which contains a second HOB1 motif (HOB1-N). The
N-terminus also contains an inhibitor domain (ID1) which silences HOB1 activity. 
GAL4 fusion experiments showed that ID1 can specifically silence HOB1-containing 
activation domains from c-Fos or c-Jun when linked in cis, but will not affect
other distinct activation domains. The c-Fos related protein, FosB, also contains
an inhibitor domain. Mutagenic and deletion analyses identify an inhibitor motif 
(IM1) conserved between c-Fos and FosB, which is required for inhibitor function.
Mutagenesis of IM1 enhances the ability of c-Fos to activate an AP1 bearing
promoter. Finally, squelching experiments suggest that c-Fos ID1 binds a limiting
protein involved in inhibition. These results demonstrate the existence of a new 
class of inhibitor domain within transcriptional activators, which acts in a
sequence specific manner to inhibit a subset of activation domains.

Various kinds of stressors induce immediate early genes (IEGs) in discrete brain 
regions. We recently reported the reduced response of Fos expression in the
hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVH) when rats are repeatedly exposed to
immobilization (IMO) stress. In this study, using in situ hybridization
histochemistry, we further extended the research to other IEGs, and the results
showed that prior exposure to IMO for 6 days suppressed the induction of fosB,
junB and NGFI-B, but NGFI-A, mRNAs in response to a challenge IMO on day 7,
suggesting that repeated stress has different effects on the transcription of
NGFI-A and the other IEGs, in the PVH.

Following chronic cocaine treatment, we have found a long-lasting increase in
AP-1 binding in the rat nucleus accumbens and striatum, two important targets of 
the behavioral effects of cocaine. This increase develops gradually over several 
days and remains at 50% of maximal levels 7 days after the last cocaine exposure.
Supershift experiments, along with one- and two-dimensional Western blots,
indicate that this chronic AP-1 complex contains at least four Fos-related
antigens (FRAs), some of which display delta FosB-like immunoreactivity, that are
induced selectively by chronic, but not acute, cocaine treatment. The same
chronic FRAs were also induced by several different types of chronic treatments
in a region-specific manner in the brain. Thus, the chronic FRAs and associated
chronic AP-1 complex could mediate some of the long-term changes in gene
expression unique to the chronic-treated state as opposed to the acute-treated
and normal states.

Differential regulation of c-fos, fosB, c-jun, junB, bcl-2 and bax expression in 
rat skin following single or chronic ultraviolet irradiation and in vivo
modulation by antisense oligodeoxynucleotide superfusion.

Gillardon F(1), Eschenfelder C, Uhlmann E, Hartschuh W, Zimmermann M.

Author information: 
(1)II. Physiologisches Institut der Universität, Heidelberg, Germany.

Single ultraviolet (u.v.) irradiation of mammalian cells in culture evokes the
transcriptional activation of various proto-oncogenes, among them members of the 
fos/jun family which are known to play an important role in cell proliferation
and differentiation. u.v. exposure of mammalian skin results in growth arrest and
cell death followed by hyperproliferation of epidermal cells. To obtain
information in vivo about a possible relationship between u.v.-induced
proto-oncogene expression and cellular alterations, we have analysed the
expression of c-fos, fosB, c-jun, junB, bcl-2 and bax in rat epidermis after
single and chronic u.v. irradiation. We present data demonstrating that the
transcripts of these genes are constitutively expressed in the epidermis and that
expression is differentially modulated by u.v. exposure. Single u.v. irradiation 
causes a rapid and sustained increase in c-jun, junB and c-fos mRNA and a decline
in bcl-2 transcripts, whereas expression of bax remained unchanged. c-Fos and
c-Jun immunoreactivity was localized throughout the epidermal cell layers 1.5 h
after single irradiation, but restricted to basal cells at 48 h suggesting an
involvement in both u.v.-induced apoptosis and hyperproliferation. 48 h after
chronic exposure a significantly higher induction and a totally different pattern
of epidermal proto-oncogene expression was detectable which may be associated
with malignancy. Superfusion of rat skin with c-fos antisense
oligodeoxynucleotides inhibited the increase in c-Fos immunolabeled epidermal
cells 1.5 h after single u.v. irradiation demonstrating that antisense
oligodeoxynucleotides are capable of penetrating mammalian skin and modulating
the u.v. response in vivo. However, suppression of the early c-Fos activation did
not significantly affect the formation of sunburn cells in the u.v.-exposed
epidermis. Thus, c-Fos does not seem to play a major role in u.v.-induced
apoptosis or other members of the fos/jun family may compensate for a loss in
c-Fos.

Jun and Fos related gene products bind to and modulate the GPE I, a strong
enhancer element of the rat glutathione transferase P gene.

The rat glutathione transferase P gene has a strong enhancer element, termed GPE 
I, which is composed of a dyad of palindromicly oriented TPA (phorbol
12-O-tetradecanoate 13-acetate) responsive element (TRE)-like sequences. TRE is a
binding sequence of the transcription factor AP-1, which consists of several
closely related proteins belonging to the Jun and Fos family. The gel retardation
experiments show that all the heterodimers formed between the Jun and Fos related
gene products bind to the GPE I as well as to the TRE. In spite of the fact that 
the GPE I has a stronger activity than the TRE, the binding affinities of these
heterodimers to the GPE I are much lower than to the TRE. Co-transfection studies
of the reporter construct containing the GPE I and expression constructs of each 
of the Jun and Fos family cDNAs indicate that FosB and delta FosB repress
transcription through the GPE I enhancer. These results suggests that some of
Jun/Fos family may regulate the rat GST-P gene expression through the GPE I in
vivo.

Transcription factor AP-1 and the glucocorticoid receptor activate gene
expression through interaction with specific DNA elements located in the
promoter/enhancer region of responsive genes. Recently, it was reported that AP-1
and the glucocorticoid receptor are able to mutually repress each others
transcriptional activity. Both, Fos and Jun consist of small families of genes
coding for structurally related proteins. The inhibition of the glucocorticoid
receptor activity by AP-1 was shown for c-Fos and c-Jun. We extended these
studies by investigating the effects of JunD, JunB and FosB on the activity of
the glucocorticoid receptor. We present evidence that co-transfection of a JunD
expression vector and a glucocorticoid hormone-dependent gene construct
containing 4 GREs (p4GRE(-37)Tk-CAT) results in a strong promoter activation by a
hormone-independent mechanism. The effect seems to be restricted to JunD (and to 
some extent FosB) whereas c-Fos, c-Jun or JunB do not mediate a significant
stimulation of the p4GRE (-37)Tk-CAT construct in similar transfection assays.
The JunD mediated activation of the p4GRE(-37)Tk-CAT is independent of the normal
glucocorticoid response since a similar activation is observed in CV-1 cells
deficient in functional glucocorticoid receptor. Finally, we show that in NIH 3T3
cells the JunD mediated transactivation through TRE elements is inhibited by
dexamethasone.

The role of Jun transcription factor expression and phosphorylation in neuronal
differentiation, neuronal cell death, and plastic adaptations in vivo.

1. To investigate the role of the Jun transcription factors in neuronal
differentiation, programmed neuronal cell death, and neuronal plasticity, we used
phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (S-ODN) to inhibit selectively the
expression of c-Jun, JunB, and JunD. 2. We have shown previously that in contrast
to c-Jun, the JunB and JunD transcription factors are negative regulators of cell
growth in various cell lines. Here we confirm this finding in primary human
fibroblasts. 3. c-Jun and JunB are counterplayers not only with respect to
proliferation, but also in cell differentiation. Since JunB expression is
essential for neuronal differentiation, we analyzed possible posttranslational
modifications of JunB after induction of PC-12 cell differentiation by nerve
growth factor (NGF). 4. JunB was strongly phosphorylated after induction of PC-12
cell differentiation with NGF but not after stimulation of cell proliferation
with serum. Thus, while cell proliferation is associated with c-Jun
phosphorylation, cell differentiation is correlated with JunB phosphorylation.
This supports the finding that c-Jun and JunB play antagonistic roles in both
proliferation and differentiation. 5. The JunB transcription factor together with
the c-Fos transcription factor is also induced in vivo in the suprachiasmatic
nucleus (SCN) of rat brain after a light stimulus that induces resetting of the
circadian clock. 6. Using antisense oligonucleotides injected into the third
ventricle, we selectively cosuppressed the two transcription factors in vivo as
shown by immunohistochemistry. Expression of c-Jun, JunD, and FosB was not
affected. Inhibition of JunB and c-Fos expression prevented the light-induced
phase shift of the circadian rhythm. In contrast, rats injected with a randomized
control oligonucleotide showed the same phase shift as untreated animals. 7. In
primary rat hippocampal cultures, anti-c-jun S-ODN selectively inhibited neuronal
cell death and promoted neuronal survival. This indicates a causal role of c-Jun 
in programmed neuronal cell death. 8. These findings demonstrate the essential
role of inducible transcription factors in the reprogramming of cells to a
different functional state. Jun transcription factors play an essential role not 
only in fundamental processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and
programmed neuronal cell death, but also in such complex processes as plastic
adaptations in the mature brain. The inhibition of neuronal cell death by
anti-c-jun S-ODN shows the great therapeutic potential of selective antisense
oligonucleotides.

Regulation of Fra-1 and Fra-2 phosphorylation differs during the cell cycle of
fibroblasts and phosphorylation in vitro by MAP kinase affects DNA binding
activity.

Gruda MC(1), Kovary K, Metz R, Bravo R.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Biology, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research 
Institute, Princeton, New Jersey 08543-4000.

The Fos family of transcription factors, c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1 and Fra-2, are
rapidly induced in quiescent fibroblasts following serum or growth factor
stimulation. The Fos proteins show distinct patterns of expression during cell
growth with only Fra-1 and Fra-2 maintained at significant levels in growing
cells, suggesting that the different family members direct unique functions for
cell growth. Post-translational modification of Fos proteins has been observed
following serum stimulation, which may allow an additional level of regulation.
Our studies show that the synthesis and post-translational modification of Fra-1 
and Fra-2 in Swiss 3T3 cells is serum-dependent during G1 following the
transition from G0 and during asynchronous growth but is serum-independent during
S phase and mitosis. Post-translational modification of Fra-1 and Fra-2 causes a 
significant shift in their gel mobility which is eliminated by alkaline
phosphatase treatment. Several kinases can phosphorylate Fra-1 and Fra-2 in
vitro, including cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC),
cyclin-dependent kinase 1-cdc2 (cdc2), and mitogen activated protein (MAP)
kinase. From these, MAP kinase is the only one that causes a shift in gel
mobility similar to that observed in vivo. One dimensional phosphopeptide maps of
Fra-1 and Fra-2 phosphorylated by MAP kinase in vitro are similar to those of in 
vivo labeled Fra-1 and Fra-2, suggesting that MAP kinase may also phosphorylate
Fra-1 and Fra-2 in vivo. We have also determined that phosphorylation of Fra-1
and Fra-2 by MAP kinase increases their DNA binding activity.

A C-terminal domain in FosB, absent in FosB/SF and Fra-1, which is able to
interact with the TATA binding protein, is required for altered cell growth.

Metz R(1), Kouzarides T, Bravo R.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Biology, Bristol-Myers-Squibb Pharmaceutical Research 
Institute, Princeton, NJ 08543-4000.

Transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes is thought to occur through interactions
between specific transcription factors and the general transcription machinery.
We show that the regulatory protein FosB, but not FosB/SF or Fra-1, specifically 
and stably associates with the TATA box binding protein (TBP) and the
multiprotein complex TFIID. The binding to TBP is specified by the last 55
C-terminal amino acids of FosB, requiring a small amino acid sequence, termed the
'TBP binding motif' (TBM). Deletion of the TBM affects transcriptional activity
slightly, but it is adjacent to a proline-rich sequence which constitutes the
major transactivation domain. However, both regions are required for the
transformation of Rat-1A cells by FosB. Transfection experiments demonstrate that
inhibition of transactivation due to excess levels of Gal4-FosB (squelching) can 
be partially relieved by the co-expression of TBP, which establishes that TFIID
is a functional target of FosB. Since TBP binding is not exhibited by FosB/SF or 
Fra-1, we suggest that the activity mediated by the TBP interaction is one
differentiating characteristic that distinguishes the FosB functions from those
of FosB/SF and Fra-1.

Suppression of c-myc or fosB-induced cell transformation by the transcription
factor IRF-1.

Tanaka N(1), Ishihara M, Taniguchi T.

Author information: 
(1)Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology, Osaka University, Japan.

The transcriptional activator IRF-1 and its antagonistic repressor IRF-2 are
regulators of the interferon (IFN) system and of cell growth. Overexpression of
IRF-2 leads to transformation of NIH3T3 cells, and the concomitant overexpression
of IRF-1 reverts this transformed phenotype. Here we report that c-myc- or
fosB-transformed rat embryonic fibroblast cells can be reverted by the
introduction of the IRF-1 gene. Thus, the anti-oncogenic function of IRF-1 is not
limited to only IRF-2 overexpressing cells, suggesting the broad role of IRF-1 as
a tumor suppressor.

Immediate early gene expression in axotomized and regenerating retinal ganglion
cells of the adult rat.

Robinson GA(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Physiology (CB 7545), University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill 27599-7545.

To determine if axotomy-induced immediate early gene (IEG) expression accompanies
regenerative efforts in central nervous system (CNS) neurons,
immunohistochemistry using antibodies to c-Jun, JunD, JunB, c-Fos, FosB and
Krox-24 proteins was used to examine gene expression in identified adult rat
retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) under two conditions: (1) after axotomy alone, and 
(2) 1 month after replacement of the optic nerve with an autologous peripheral
nerve graft to allow axonal regrowth. Strong RGC c-Jun expression was induced 1
day, but not 3 h, after axotomy in most RGCs and was maintained in surviving
cells throughout the 3-week study period. Axotomy also induced a limited number
of RGCs to express Krox-24, but only transiently. c-Fos expression was also seen 
in a limited number of control RGCs, however, it was not induced by axotomy.
Nucleolar FosB immunoreactivity in axotomized RGCs persisted 1 day after axotomy,
but was subsequently lost. One month after axotomy and peripheral nerve graft
placement, identified RGCs with regrown axons showed only nuclear c-Jun and
nucleolar FosB expression. These findings support a role for IEG expression in
the regeneration process of CNS neurons.

Clozapine and haloperidol produce a differential pattern of immediate early gene 
expression in rat caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, lateral septum and islands 
of Calleja.

School of Medicine, New Zealand.

Acute administration of the typical neuroleptic haloperidol (HAL, 2 mg/kg)
induced the immediate-early gene proteins (IEGPs) c-Fos, Fos-related antigens
(FRAs), FosB, JunB, JunD and Krox24 in the striatum and nucleus accumbens of the 
rat brain. In contrast, acute administration of the atypical antipsychotic drug
clozapine (CLOZ, 30 mg/kg) induced only FRAs, JunB and Krox24 IEGPs in the
striatum, and c-Fos, FRAs, and Krox24 IEGPs in the nucleus accumbens. c-Jun was
not induced by acute administration of HAL or CLOZ in the rat brain. Differential
induction of IEGs by HAL and CLOZ was also observed in the lateral septal nucleus
and the islands of Calleja complex of the rat brain. These differences in IEG
induction by HAL and CLOZ may be related to the different clinical profiles of
the two drugs. Specifically, CLOZ induces FRAs in the islands of Calleja and
lateral septum and this action may be involved in its therapeutic effects on the 
negative symptoms of schizophrenia, whereas HAL produces a coordinate induction
of Fos and JunB in striatal neurons and this dimer combination may be involved in
producing the extrapyramidal side-effects of typical neuroleptics.

Glutamate receptor-driven activation of transcription factors in primary neuronal
cultures.

We have used primary neuronal cultures prepared from fetal cerebral hemispheres
to investigate the effects of different glutamate receptor agonists and
antagonists on the expression of transcription factor encoding genes, such as
c-fos, fosB, c-jun, junB, junD, c-myc, and zif/268. The addition of glutamate
(100 microM) to the culture medium rapidly activated c-fos, fosB, c-jun, junB and
zif/268 gene expression, reaching the maximal level at 30-60 minutes for zif/268 
and at 60 minutes for the other genes. The onset of fosB mRNA accumulation was
slightly delayed in comparison to the other genes. No clear induction was found
for junD and c-myc. Different glutamate receptor agonists, such as NMDA, kainate,
quisqualate, trans-(+/-)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (t-ACPD) and
alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) were able to
increase c-fos, c-jun, and zif-268 mRNA levels with rapid and transient kinetics 
similar to those observed after glutamate treatment. Similar results were
obtained for junB and fosB after kainate and quisqualate stimulation.
Pretreatment with MK-801, a non competitive NMDA antagonist, produced an almost
complete inhibition of glutamate-driven expression of transcription factor genes,
thus suggesting that NMDA receptor plays a major role in glutamate induced-gene
expression. On the contrary the kainate/AMPA receptor antagonist, DNQX, did not
influence glutamate induced-gene expression. Under the conditions used in the
present study, NMDA was effective in inducing the simultaneous activation of
several IEGs even when added to the culture medium containing millimolar
concentration of magnesium. When experiments were performed in Krebs solution,
NMDA was effective in stimulating zif/268 and c-fos mRNAs only in the absence of 
Mg2+, while glutamate activated c-fos and zif/268 both in the presence and
absence of magnesium ions. As expected, NMDA effect was fully inhibited by
MK-801. The level of AP-1 DNA binding activity, as measured by electrophoretic
mobility shift assay, increased after addition of glutamate and NMDA to cultured 
neurons and such increase was antagonized by the pretreatment with MK-801.

An autonomous N-terminal transactivation domain in Fos protein plays a crucial
role in transformation.

Jooss KU(1), Funk M, Müller R.

Author information: 
(1)Institut für Molekularbiologie und Tumorforschung (IMT), Philipps-Universität 
Marburg, Germany.

To date, three functional domains have been defined in c-Fos and v-Fos proteins
and have been shown to play a role in transactivation: the leucine zipper
mediating hetero-dimerization, the basic DNA contact site, and a C-terminally
located transactivation domain (C-TA) harbouring the HOB1 and HOB2 motifs. While 
the bZip region, consisting of the leucine zipper and the DNA contact site, is
indispensable for transformation, the C-TA domain is not required and is actually
altered by internal deletions in the FBR-MuSV. We now show that the N-terminal
regions of c-Fos and v-Fos contain a second transactivation domain (N-TA). A
functionally crucial motif within the N-TA domain, termed NTM, was pinpointed to 
a approximately 25 amino acid stretch around positions 60-84 which is highly
conserved in FosB. Analysis of LexA fusion proteins showed that the N-TA domains 
of both c-Fos and FosB function in an autonomous fashion in both fibroblasts and 
yeast. Most importantly, deletion of the NTM motif impairs the transforming
properties of v-Fos. Apart from the bZip region, the N-TA domain is the only
functional domain required for transformation by v-Fos, at least when its
expression is driven by the strong FBR-MuSV-LTR promoter.

T1 is a c-Fos- and FosB-responsive gene which is induced by growth factors
through multiple signal transduction pathways.

Kalousek MB(1), Trüb T, Schuermann M, Klemenz R.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, University Hospital, Zürich, Switzerland.

Stimulation of quiescent cells with growth factors triggers changes in gene
expression through multiple signal transduction pathways. One of these changes in
Swiss 3T3 cells is the strong accumulation of T1 mRNA which encodes a secreted
glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Proliferating cells continued to 
express T1 mRNA at a lower level, whereas growth arrest induced either by serum
deprivation or by contact inhibition was paralleled by the disappearance of the
T1 mRNA. T1 mRNA synthesis in response to serum and platelet-derived growth
factor stimulation is mediated through protein kinase C-dependent and protein
kinase C-independent pathways. Activation of protein kinase A also led to T1 gene
expression. Ongoing protein synthesis is a prerequisite for T1 gene induction by 
growth factors which defines T1 as a delayed early serum-responsive gene. The
ability of the immediate early transcription factors c-Fos and FosB to directly
induce the T1 gene was demonstrated in a conditional expression system in the
absence of protein synthesis. Furthermore, all known inducers of the T1 gene also
lead to c-fos gene activation. Thus we show that the T1 gene is regulated by
signals which are transduced through multiple pathways and provide evidence that 
the Fos proteins play an important role in the integration of these pathways.

Immediate-early gene expression in response to hypertrophic and proliferative
stimuli in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla

Remodeling of the pulmonary vascular tree in pulmonary hypertension is associated
with hypertrophy and proliferation of smooth muscle cells. Since the stimuli and 
signaling pathways for these processes are not well understood, we used a rat
pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell line (PAC1) to examine the effects of
thrombin and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) on cellular growth and
immediate-early gene expression. Over 72 h, thrombin (1 unit/ml) caused
hypertrophy as reflected by a 102 +/- 12% increase in protein synthesis and a 49 
+/- 11% increase in protein content per cell, but no change in cell number. PDGF 
(2.5 ng/ml) stimulated proliferation as evidenced by an increase in cell number
(doubling in 5 days), but no significant change in protein content per cell.
Immediate-early gene expression was examined by Northern blotting: both thrombin 
and PDGF induced egr-1, c-fos, c-jun, junB, and fra-1 mRNAs within 15 min; the
response was maximal at 30-60 min (increases ranging from 2.9- to 9.3-fold over
control serum-deprived cells) and returned to base-line levels within 2-4 h.
Neither agent affected junD mRNA levels. However, thrombin but not PDGF, caused
an increase in fosB mRNA levels (7.7 +/- 4.0-fold higher than control, n = 12, p 
< 0.0005). The immediate-early gene response to both agonists was generally
dependent on extracellular Ca2+, Na2+/H+ exchange, and protein kinase C
activation, but not on cAMP. The exception was c-jun mRNA, the levels of which
were not affected by inhibition of protein kinase C, but decreased significantly 
by prevention of cAMP formation. Thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores
were necessary for the response to thrombin, but not to PDGF. These results
demonstrate that thrombin is a hypertrophic agent and that PDGF is a
proliferative agent in PAC1 cells. These two agonists stimulate increases in a
variety of immediate-early gene mRNAs, but only thrombin induces fosB mRNA.

Agonist-selective regulation of polyphosphoinositide metabolism in pulmonary
artery smooth muscle cells.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmacology, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla
92093.

Using a rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell line (PAC1), detailed analysis of
polyphosphoinositide (PPI) metabolism reveals receptor type-selective patterns in
the formation of inositol phosphates and 3-hydroxyphosphorylated PPIs. Responses 
to several agonists that stimulate hypertrophy or proliferation were examined,
and distinct categories of response profile were observed. Thrombin and
angiotensin II stimulated the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol (PI)
4,5-bisphosphate and the formation of several cytosolic species of inositol
phosphates without the activation of PI 3-hydroxykinase. The response to thrombin
was distinctive because a very large production of inositol 1,4-bisphosphate was 
accompanied by hydrolysis of PI 4-phosphate. The response to platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF) was distinguished by the production of the PI
3-hydroxykinase product, PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate, and the appearance of PI
3-hydroxykinase activity in immunoprecipitates. PDGF treatment of PAC1 cultures
did not produce accumulation of detectable amounts of inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate, although a small sustained elevation in the level of
inositol monophosphate and a gradual accumulation of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate
were observed. Characterization of these distinctive responses permitted us to
correlate agonist-regulated PPI metabolism with induction of immediate-early
genes and stimulation of hypertrophy or proliferation of PAC1 cultures (Rothman, 
A., Wolner, B., Button, D., and Taylor, P. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 6399-6404).
Thrombin-stimulated PPI turnover and the production of a high level of inositol
bisphosphate may be early signals linked to the induction of fosB and PAC1 cell
hypertrophy, whereas the activation of PI 3-hydroxykinase and the accumulation of
PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate in response to PDGF appear to be associated with
mitogenesis.

Expression of nitric oxide synthase and colocalisation with Jun, Fos and Krox
transcription factors in spinal cord neurons following noxious stimulation of the
rat hindpaw.

Herdegen T(1), Rüdiger S, Mayer B, Bravo R, Zimmermann M.

Author information: 
(1)II. Institute of Physiology, University of Heidelberg, FRG.

Expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) was investigated in neurons of lumbar
spinal cord of adult rats following subcutaneous injection of formalin (FOR) in
one hindpaw. NOS was visualized immunocytochemically using a specific antibody
and by the NADPH-diaphorase reaction (NDP). In the untreated rat, NOS
immunoreactivity (IR) and NDP were present in neurons of the superficial dorsal
horn (sDH) predominantly in layers II-III, and in the deep dorsal horn (dDH)
predominantly in layer X. Twenty-four hours following FOR, the numbers of neurons
labelled for NOS and NDP and the density of NDP containing nerve fiber
varicosities significantly increased in sDH of the ipsilateral L3-L4 segments.
NOS-IR and NDP gave a rather congruent distribution of labelled neurons in the
dorsal horn. In contrast, distinct NOS-IR but not NDP was visible in large
diameter motoneurons and in the lateral spinal nucleus. Double labelling
demonstrated that in sDH most of the NDP-reactive neurons show a close spatial
relationship to fibers and varicosities immunoreactive for substance P and CGRP. 
These neuropeptides are considered mediators of synaptic input from nociceptive
primary afferents. Colocalization of NDP with c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, FosB and 
Krox-24 transcription factors was investigated in neurons of lumbar spinal cord. 
c-Jun, JunB, c-Fos and Krox-24 reached their maximal levels of expression 2 h
after FOR and returned to basal levels after 10 h. FosB and JunD reached their
maximal expression after 5 h, persisted up to 10 h and were still visible in
60%-70% of the maximal number of labelled nuclei after 24 h. This persistent
expression of transcription factors might contribute to the up-regulation of NOS 
expression between 10 h and 24 h. In a low number of NDP neurons, suprabasal
immunoreactivity of JunB, c-Fos and Krox-24 proteins was visible up to 10 h, and 
of JunD and FosB up to 24 h in sDH neurons; c-Jun was not expressed in NDP
labelled neurons of sDH, but, similar as JunD, showed basal colocalization in
preganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons. In dDH, colocalization of 
Jun, Fos and Krox-24 proteins in few neurons was only observed following a second
FOR stimulus given 24 h after the first one. Double-staining also demonstrated
that many Jun, Fos and Krox labelled neurons are in close proximity to NDP
labelled nerve fibers suggesting a functional relationship between expression of 
immediate-early gene encoded transcription factors and presence of nitric oxide
in the rat spinal cord.

Fos family members successively occupy the tyrosine hydroxylase gene AP-1 site
after nerve growth factor or epidermal growth factor stimulation and can repress 
transcription.

Gizang-Ginsberg E(1), Ziff EB.

Author information: 
(1)Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biochemistry, New York
University Medical Center, New York 10016.

Nerve growth factor induces the neuronal-like differentiation of PC12 cells, and 
epidermal growth factor promotes PC12 viability and is weakly mitogenic. Despite 
these differences, both growth factors induce indistinguishable patterns of
transient delayed transcription of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene and the
expression of proteins encoded by Fos gene family members. Thus, TH expression is
sensitive to signaling pathways common to these two growth factors. We show that 
c-fos and fosB successively occupy an AP-1 site-like element of the TH promoter
after nerve growth factor treatment. Furthermore, under conditions of transient
transfection, Fos family proteins may synergize with c-jun to transrepress TH
gene transcription through the TH-fat-specific element. We show that the target
of repression is the AP-1 site-like element that lies within the TH-fat-specific 
element. We demonstrate that this site is also a major positive acting site for
TH control. These results suggest a model in which the long term effect of c-fos 
family protein expression is to limit the expression of the TH gene. We consider 
the novel properties of this element in providing temporal and cell type-specific
regulation of TH transcription.

The Fos family of proteins now includes seven members: the retroviral proteins
FBR-v-Fos and FBJ-v-Fos and the cellular proteins c-Fos, FosB, FosB2, Fra1, and
Fra2. Four proteins (FBR-v-Fos, FBJ-v-Fos, c-Fos, and FosB) transform established
rodent fibroblast cell lines, while three (FosB2, Fra1, and Fra2) do not. As all 
family members display sequence-specific DNA-binding activity as part of a
heterodimeric complex with Jun proteins, other features must account for the
differences in transforming potential. We demonstrate here that all transforming 
members have a C-terminal transactivation domain that is lacking in
nontransforming members. The nontransforming proteins Fra1 and Fra2 can be
converted to transforming proteins by fusion of a transactivation domain from
either FosB or VP16. We also demonstrate that differences in the basic
region-leucine zipper domain affecting either the affinity or sequence
specificity of DNA binding are not determinants of the difference in transforming
potential among members of the Fos family. The results further define the
functional requirements for transformation by Fos proteins and suggest that the
subunit composition of AP1 complexes is an important determinant of mitogenic
signalling capability.

Expression of nuclear proto-oncogenes in isoproterenol-induced cardiac
hypertrophy.

Brand T(1), Sharma HS, Schaper W.

Author information: 
(1)Max-Planck-Institute, Department of Experimental Cardiology, Bad Nauheim,
Germany.

Rat hearts infused with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol were examined
for the expression of several nuclear proto-oncogenes (c-fos, fosB, c-jun, junB, 
and junD) and the immediate early gene Egr-1. During the first 24 h after the
start of infusion, a strong but transient expression of c-fos was observed.
Expression of c-jun and junD were not elevated whereas junB was. By using
specific antagonists to the alpha- (prazosin) and beta-adrenergic receptor
(propranolol), a beta-adrenoceptor-specific blockade of the
isoproterenol-mediated nuclear response was demonstrated. In situ hybridization
localized c-fos expression to cardiac myocytes. Labelling was distributed focally
in the left and right ventricles, and was strong and homogeneous in the atria. In
contrast to beta-adrenergic stimulation, alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation with
phenylephrine and norepinephrine caused the induction of c-jun and Egr-1 in
addition to the proto-oncogenes induced by isoproterenol. Thus distinct programs 
of early response gene expression were expressed in response to alpha- versus
beta-adrenergic stimulation.

Transcriptional activation and transformation by chimaeric Fos-estrogen receptor 
proteins: altered properties as a consequence of gene fusion.

Schuermann M(1), Hennig G, Müller R.

Author information: 
(1)Institut für Molekularbiologie und Tumorforschung (IMT), Philipps-Universität 
Marburg, Germany.

We have generated a series of conditionally active Fos and FosB proteins by
fusion with a C-terminal fragment of the human estrogen receptor (ER) which
harbours the ligand binding site and the overlapping hormone-inducible
transactivation domain TAF-2. The chimaeric Fos-ER proteins showed
estrogen-inducible activation of TRE (TPA-responsive element)-directed
transcription and hormone-dependent transformation of fibroblasts. These
properties of the fusion proteins were independent of the transregulatory and
transforming properties of their normal non-fused counterparts c-Fos, v-Fos,
FosB-L and FosB-S. Thus c-Fos-ER and FosB-S-ER were strong transforming proteins 
in the presence of hormone, although c-Fos and FosB-S possess only marginal
oncogenic properties. In addition, all fusion proteins showed increased
transactivation in the presence of estrogen, again most noticeable in the case of
c-Fos-ER and FosB-S-ER. The ER-fusion thus basically eliminated the differences
in the transactivating potential seen among the various native Fos proteins. Our 
data therefore provide evidence: (i) that the hormone binding domain of the human
estrogen receptor, apart from delivering hormonal control to a heterologous
protein, can have profound effects on the activity of certain transcription
factors, particularly on proteins with weak oncogenic and/or transregulatory
potential, and (ii) that the transforming potential of c-Fos and FosB-S can be
dramatically elevated by increasing their transactivating properties.

SnoI, a novel alternatively spliced isoform of the ski protooncogene homolog,
sno.

Pearson-White S(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, University of Virginia Medical Center,
Charlottesville 22908.

We have cloned and sequenced a novel human isoform of sno, snoI for insertion.
SnoI contains 1330 nucleotides inserted in place of 7 nucleotides of the snoN
mRNA. Sno is a member of the ski protooncogene family, which has been implicated 
in muscle development. The two previously known sno alternatively spliced
isoforms are snoN (684 amino acids), and snoA (415 amino acids); snoI encodes a
truncated isoform of 399 amino acids (44,298 MW). Southern blot experiments show 
that snoI contains a third alternative exon from the sno gene; a single sno gene 
can express all three isoforms of sno by alternative splicing. All three isoforms
contain the region that is most similar to the ski proto-oncogene. The
relationship between snoI and snoN is analogous to that between delta fosB and
fosB, where a truncated form of the fosB transcription factor is produced by
alternative splicing. We find conservation of human snoI-specific sequences in
several mammalian species, in monkey, dog, cow, rabbit and pig, but not in
rodents, whereas the common portion of the sno gene is conserved in all
vertebrate species tested. SnoN, snoA, and ski mRNAs accumulate in many human
tissues including skeletal muscle; the snoI alternative mRNA accumulates more
specifically in skeletal muscle. SnoI is also expressed in rhabdomyosarcoma
tumor, a tumor that contains differentiated skeletal muscle. The tissue-specific 
alternative splicing of human snoI, an mRNA in the ski/sno gene family, and the
presence of sno mRNAs in muscle are consistent with a proposed role for the sno
oncogene in muscle gene regulation.

Osteoblasts are target cells for transformation in c-fos transgenic mice.

Grigoriadis AE(1), Schellander K, Wang ZQ, Wagner EF.

Author information: 
(1)Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna, Austria.

We have generated transgenic mice expressing the proto-oncogene c-fos from an
H-2Kb class I MHC promoter as a tool to identify and isolate cell populations
which are sensitive to altered levels of Fos protein. All homozygous H2-c-fosLTR 
mice develop osteosarcomas with a short latency period. This phenotype is
specific for c-fos as transgenic mice expressing the fos- and jun-related genes, 
fosB and c-jun, from the same regulatory elements do not develop any pathology
despite high expression in bone tissues. The c-fos transgene is not expressed
during embryogenesis but is expressed after birth in bone tissues before the
onset of tumor formation, specifically in putative preosteoblasts, bone-forming
osteoblasts, osteocytes, as well as in osteoblastic cells present within the
tumors. Primary and clonal cell lines established from c-fos-induced tumors
expressed high levels of exogenous c-fos as well as the bone cell marker genes,
type I collagen, alkaline phosphatase, and osteopontin/2ar. In contrast,
osteocalcin/BGP expression was either low or absent. All cell lines were
tumorigenic in vivo, some of which gave rise to osteosarcomas, expressing
exogenous c-fos mRNA, and Fos protein in osteoblastic cells. Detailed analysis of
one osteogenic cell line, P1, and several P1-derived clonal cell lines indicated 
that bone-forming osteoblastic cells were transformed by Fos. The regulation of
osteocalcin/BGP and alkaline phosphatase gene expression by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3 was abrogated in P1-derived clonal cells, whereas glucocorticoid
responsiveness was unaltered. These results suggest that high levels of Fos
perturb the normal growth control of osteoblastic cells and exert specific
effects on the expression of the osteoblast phenotype.

Proliferative activation of quiescent Rat-1A cells by delta FosB.

Nakabeppu Y(1), Oda S, Sekiguchi M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.

Fos and Jun transcription factors are induced during the normal course of the
proliferative response of quiescent cells to serum or to growth factors. We have 
shown that delta FosB, an alternatively spliced form of FosB, is formed as
rapidly as FosB in serum-stimulated Rat-1A cells. Although delta FosB lacks the
C-terminal region of FosB carrying the transactivation function, constitutive
expression of delta FosB transforms Rat-1A cells as does expression of FosB. The 
transforming ability of delta FosB suggests that delta FosB may lead to
proliferative activation of quiescent cells without activating AP-1-responsive
genes. To address this question, FosB or delta FosB was expressed as a fusion
protein with the ligand binding domain of the human estrogen receptor (ER) in
Rat-1A cells. After estrogen treatment, the fusion protein accumulates in nuclei 
and forms stable complexes with Jun proteins. We have shown that ER-delta FosB or
to a lesser extent ER-FosB triggers quiescent Rat-1A cells to transit G1,
initiate DNA replication, and ultimately undergo cell division at least once.
Since ER-FosB, but not ER-delta FosB, induced expression of the AP-1-responsive
transin/stromelysin gene, we concluded that the N-terminal region and the DNA
binding domain of FosB or delta FosB itself have the potential to regulate cell
proliferation and that the transactivation function carried by the C-terminal
region of FosB is not essential for the proliferative activation of quiescent
cells.

Suppression of the growth factor-mediated induction of c-fos and down-modulation 
of AP-1-binding activity are not required for cellular senescence.

Lucibello FC(1), Brüsselbach S, Sewing A, Müller R.

Author information: 
(1)Institut für Molekularbiologie und Tumorforschung (IMT), Philipps-Universität 
Marburg, Germany.

It has been suggested that the impaired response of the c-fos gene to serum
growth factors and the concomitant loss of AP-1 activity may be a crucial step in
the process of cellular senescence. In the present study, we provide evidence
arguing against such a conclusion. Data obtained in five independent experiments 
showed that both c-fos RNA and protein expression were similar in 'young' and in 
senescent serum-stimulated WI-38 cells, suggesting that the previously reported
suppression of c-fos induction is not an obligatory event in the process of
cellular senescence. Likewise, expression of fra-1, c-jun and junB continued to
be high in serum-stimulated senescent cells, while induction of fosB was reduced 
approximately fivefold. Among all genes tested fosB thus seems to be the most
suitable marker for the detection of senescent cells. Stimulated senescent cells 
showed only a approximately twofold reduction of AP-1-binding activity, and
senescent cells continuously exposed to serum exhibited normal AP-1-binding
activity. These observations support the conclusion that a down-modulation of
AP-1 is not crucial for human fibroblasts to enter the senescent state.

Proto-oncogene FosB: the amino terminus encodes a regulatory function required
for transformation.

Wisdom R(1), Verma IM.

Author information: 
(1)Molecular Biology and Virology Laboratory, Salk Institute, San Diego,
California 92186-5800.

Overexpression of some members of the Fos gene family, including FosB, leads to
transformation of established rodent fibroblasts. We have previously shown that
transformation by FosB requires the presence of a C-terminal transcriptional
activation domain. We now report that transformation by FosB also requires an
intact DNA-binding domain composed of the functionally bipartite basic region and
leucine zipper as well as sequences present in the N terminus that serve a
regulatory function. Deletion of the N-terminal sequences results in proteins
impaired in transcriptional activation and transformation. This region does not
itself function as a transcriptional activation domain but instead regulates the 
transactivation functions present in the FosB-Jun complex. The requirement for
this N-terminal region can be abolished by the presence of a strong constitutive 
activation domain. The primary sequence of the region that we have defined is
highly conserved in the Fos family of proteins, suggesting functional
conservation.

Localization of Fos and Jun proteins in rat aortic smooth muscle cells after
vascular injury.

The availability of specific reagents to measure gene activity has provided
important tools and potential new directions for the study of smooth muscle cell 
(SMC) proliferation in vivo. In this report, we have measured steady-state mRNA
levels of several fos and jun family members in aortic tissue by Northern
blotting after vascular injury. In addition, protein products of these genes were
analyzed by immunocytochemistry. Within 15 minutes of balloon injury, mRNA levels
of c-fos, fosB, c-jun, junB, and junD were elevated severalfold. In contrast,
fos-related antigen (fra-1) mRNA showed a delayed onset of expression. The
expression kinetics of these immediate early genes was similar to those in
cultured cells stimulated to undergo proliferation by growth factors, suggesting 
that such SMC gene activation in vivo reflects permeation of blood-derived growth
factors into the vessel wall or intravascular release of preformed growth
factors. Translation of fos and jun genes into immunoreactive products was
demonstrated 2 hours after balloon injury with antisera to Fos and Jun proteins. 
Treating rats with cycloheximide abolished this immunoreactivity. The
distribution of Fos and Jun products was concentrated in SMC nuclei at the
luminal border of the rat aorta. Such focal expression may have consequences for 
the initiation of SMC DNA synthesis and migration after vascular injury.
Furthermore, the expression of Fos and Jun proteins in SMC after vascular balloon
injury may be used as an index of SMC activation under a variety of experimental 
settings.

primary astroglial cultures.

Stella AM.

Author information:

We have characterized the genomic response of astroglial cells to excitatory
amino acids by using selective agonists and antagonists for the various receptor 
subtypes and by analyzing different primary response genes, such as members of
the Fos (c-fos and fosB) and Jun (c-jun, junB, and junD) families, zif/268, and
c-myc. A rapid and transient elevation of mRNA levels for c-fos, fosB, c-jun,
junB, and zif/268 was observed after addition of glutamate to cultured
astrocytes, whereas junD and c-myc expression was not affected. The level of AP-1
DNA binding activity, as measured by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay,
also increased after addition of glutamate to cultured astrocytes.
Glutamate-induced c-fos expression was not affected by the N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptor antagonists MK-801 and D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate, by the
kainate/alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5- methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptor
antagonist 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), or by the broad-spectrum
antagonist kynurenate. Kainate and AMPA were also effective in inducing primary
response gene expression, and their actions were antagonized by kynurenate and
DNQX but not by MK-801. 1S,3R-1-Aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid, a
selective agonist for the metabotropic glutamate receptor, induced primary
response gene expression, but its action was not antagonized by different
glutamate antagonists, including L-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionate. In conclusion, 
our data suggest that cultured astrocytes express both kainate/AMPA ionotropic
receptors and metabotropic receptors coupled to the rapid and coordinated
activation of different classes of transcriptional factor genes.

Heterodimerization with c-Fos is not required for cell transformation of chicken 
embryo fibroblasts by Jun.

Hughes M(1), Sehgal A, Hadman M, Bos T.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Eastern Virginia Medical School,
Norfolk 23501.

c-Jun belongs to a family of proteins that require dimerization for activity.
Dimerization occurs through a leucine-rich region near the carboxy terminus
called the leucine zipper. Jun can form dimeric complexes with other Jun family
as well as Fos family members. The relative proportion of these different dimeric
complexes is determined by the relative abundance of each family member at a
particular time. Overexpression of v-Jun or c-Jun alone will lead to cell
transformation of chicken embryo fibroblasts, albeit with varying efficiencies.
Upon overexpression, v-Jun or c-Jun presumably becomes the predominant AP-1
component in the cell. Theoretically, this should lead to a larger proportion of 
homodimers than heterodimers. It is not clear what role, if any, the other Jun
and Fos family proteins play during cell transformation. We have examined the
ability of Jun to induce cell transformation in chicken embryo fibroblasts in the
absence of interaction with other Jun or Fos family proteins. To this end, we
have constructed a chicken v-Jun mutant that is incapable of heterodimerization. 
This was accomplished by replacing the leucine zipper region of Jun with that of 
the yeast transcription factor GCN4. This chimeric protein, VJ-GLZ, retains all
of the DNA binding and transcriptional activation domains of v-Jun. As expected, 
in vitro translated VJ-GLZ was found to be incapable of forming heterodimers with
c-Fos, FosB, and JunD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Proto-oncogene expression in porcine myocardium subjected to ischemia and

and Clinical Research, Bad Neuheim, FRG.

The molecular basis of myocardial adaptation to ischemia and reperfusion is
poorly understood. It is thought that nuclear proto-oncogenes act as third
messengers, converting cytoplasmic signal transduction into long-term changes of 
gene expression. We studied the expression of six nuclear proto-oncogenes (Egr-1,
c-fos, fosB, c-jun, junB, and c-myc) in myocardium subjected to ischemia and
reperfusion in anesthetized pigs. Stunning was achieved by two 10-minute left
anterior descending coronary artery occlusions separated by 30 minutes of
reperfusion. Hearts were excised after the first occlusion, after the first
reperfusion, and at 30, 120, 150, and 210 minutes of reperfusion after the second
occlusion. Total RNA was prepared from stunned as well as normally perfused
myocardial tissue and subjected to Northern blotting. The response of the six
nuclear proto-oncogenes varied.fosB gene expression was never detected. The c-myc
gene was expressed, but its level was unchanged by ischemia. c-jun expression was
slightly increased by ischemia (3.1 +/- 0.6-fold). The c-fos, Egr-1, and junB
genes were highly induced, being fivefold to sevenfold higher in experimental
than in control tissue. In three animals pretreated with the beta 1-antagonist
metoprolol and then subjected to the above experimental protocol, the induction
of proto-oncogenes was similar to that in nonblocked controls. Our results show
that the myocardial adaptive response to ischemic stress includes the induction
of at least four transcription factors that may be further operative in repair
processes and angiogenesis.

Existence of different Fos/Jun complexes during the G0-to-G1 transition and
during exponential growth in mouse fibroblasts: differential role of Fos
proteins.

Kovary K(1), Bravo R.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Biology, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research 
Institute, Princeton, New Jersey 08543-4000.

We have determined the different Fos/Jun complexes present in Swiss 3T3 cells
either following serum stimulation of quiescent cells or during exponential
growth by immunoprecipitation analyses. We have shown that while c-Fos is the
major Fos protein associated with the Jun proteins (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) soon
after serum stimulation, at later times Fra-1 and Fra-2 are the predominant Fos
proteins associated with the different Jun proteins. During exponential growth,
the synthesis of Fra-1 and Fra-2 is maintained at a significant level, in
contrast to c-Fos and FosB, which are expressed at very low or undetectable
levels. Consequently, Fra-1 and Fra-2 are the main Fos proteins complexed with
the Jun proteins in asynchronously growing cells. To determine whether the Fos
proteins are differentially required during the G0-to-G1 transition and
exponential growth for the entrance into S phase, we microinjected
affinity-purified antibodies directed against c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2. We
have found that while the activities of c-Fos and FosB are required mostly during
the G0-to-G1 transition, Fra-1 and Fra-2 are involved both in the G0-to-G1
transition and in asynchronous growth.

The dyad palindromic glutathione transferase P enhancer binds multiple factors
including AP1.

Diccianni MB(1), Imagawa M, Muramatsu M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, University of Tokyo Faculty of Medicine, Japan.

Glutathione Transferase P (GST-P) gene expression is dominantly regulated by an
upstream enhancer (GPEI) consisting of a dyad of palindromically oriented
imperfect TPA (12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate)-responsive elements (TRE). 
GPEI is active in AP1-lacking F9 cells as well in AP1-containing HeLa cells.
Despite GPEI's similarity to a TRE, c-jun co-transfection has only a minimal
effect on transactivation. Antisense c-jun and c-fos co-transfection experiments 
further demonstrate the lack of a role for AP1 in GPEI mediated trans-activation 
in F9 cells, although endogenously present AP1 can influence GPEI in HeLa cells. 
Co-transfection of delta fosB with c-jun, which forms an inactive c-Jun/delta
FosB heterodimer that binds TRE sequences, inhibits GPEI-mediated transcription
in AP1-lacking F9 cells as well as AP1-containing HeLa cells. These data suggest 
novel factor(s) other than AP1 are influencing GPEI. Binding studies reveal
multiple nucleoproteins bind to GPEI. These factors are likely responsible for
the high level of GPEI-mediated transcription observed in the absence of AP1 and 
during hepatocarcinogenesis.

Induction of AP-1 transcription factor components during T-cell activation by
interleukin 1 and phorbol esters.

Yoza BK(1), Brooks JW, Mizel SB.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Wake Forest University Medical
Center, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27103.

We have examined the effect of interleukin 1 (IL-1) and phorbol esters
[12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)] on the expression of various
components of the AP-1 transcription factor complex during T-cell activation. We 
previously found that a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene driven by
the collagenase TPA responsive element was expressed upon stimulation of T-cells 
by TPA and that this expression was enhanced when IL-1 was added as a
costimulant; IL-1 alone had no effect on TPA responsive element-chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase expression. In this study, we have found that stimulation of
T-cells by IL-1 and TPA is accompanied by activation of a subset of immediate
early genes that comprise the AP-1 transcription factor complex. junB and fosB
were rapidly induced following stimulation with TPA. Although the levels of other
fos-related mRNAs were also elevated, their maximal induction was delayed by
approximately 5 h. IL-1 alone had little or no effect, but enhanced TPA induced
transcription and steady-state levels of these mRNAs. The expression of fos and
jun during T-cell activation was accompanied by increased specific binding of
JunB, FosB, and fos-related antigen containing complexes to the TPA responsive
element. These findings indicate that the synergistic effect of IL-1 and TPA on
AP-1 mediated gene expression is due, in part, to the ability of IL-1 to enhance 
the expression of genes encoding specific AP-1 transcription factor
components.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Biphasic increase in c-jun mRNA is required for induction of AP-1-mediated gene
transcription: differential effects of muscarinic and thrombin receptor
activation.

Trejo J(1), Chambard JC, Karin M, Brown JH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla
92093.

Activation of either muscarinic cholinergic or thrombin receptors increases
phosphoinositide turnover, Ca2+ mobilization, and redistribution of protein
kinase C and induces rapid transient increases in c-fos mRNA and c-jun mRNA in
1321N1 cells. To determine whether the increases in c-fos and c-jun mRNA induced 
by carbachol and thrombin are sufficient to stimulate AP-1-mediated
transactivation, 1321N1 cells were transfected with a reporter carrying two
copies of the tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate response element and the firefly
luciferase gene. Thrombin was significantly more effective than carbachol at
stimulating AP-1-mediated transactivation. To identify the factors underlying the
difference in AP-1 activity induced by carbachol and thrombin, members of the fos
and jun families which encode components of AP-1 were examined. Carbachol and
thrombin have similar effects on expression of c-fos, fosB, fra-2, junB, and
junD, both acutely and over a 24-h time course. However, whereas carbachol leads 
only to transient induction of c-jun (maximal at 0.5 h), thrombin induces a
biphasic increase in c-jun mRNA--an initial peak at 0.5 h and a second,
more-prolonged increase at 12 h. Thrombin but not carbachol also induces a late
increase in fra-1 mRNA, which peaks at 12 h. The secondary increase in c-jun mRNA
is associated with marked increases in c-Jun protein levels and AP-1 DNA-binding 
activity. The late induction of c-jun and fra-1 mRNA can be prevented by adding
the antagonist hirudin 30 min after thrombin, which results in loss of
thrombin-stimulated increases in c-Jun protein, AP-1 DNA-binding activity, and
AP-1-mediated transactivation. These findings suggest that rapid and transient
conduction of c-fos and c-jun mRNA is insufficient to induce prominent changes in
gene transcription, while the sustained increase in c-jun mRNA and perhaps the
late induction of fra-1 mRNA are required for generation of AP-1 DNA-binding
activity and transactivation through AP-1.

Regulation of immediate early gene expression and AP-1 binding in the rat nucleus
accumbens by chronic cocaine.

Hope B(1), Kosofsky B, Hyman SE, Nestler EJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, Connecticut
Mental Health Center, New Haven 06508.

Chronic treatment of rats with cocaine leads to long-term biochemical changes in 
the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region implicated in mediating the
reinforcing effects of cocaine and other drugs of abuse. Immediate early genes
(IEGs) and their protein products appear to play an important role in transducing
extracellular stimuli into altered patterns of cellular gene expression and,
therefore, into long-term changes in cellular functioning. We therefore examined 
changes in the mRNA levels for the IEGs c-fos, c-jun, fosB, junB, and zif268 in
the NAc of rats treated acutely and chronically with cocaine. A single cocaine
injection increased the mRNA levels of all of the IEGs examined. Following
chronic cocaine treatment, however, IEG expression had returned to control levels
and was not significantly increased following a further acute challenge with
cocaine, suggesting desensitization in the ability of cocaine to induce these
IEGs. Similarly, levels of Fos-like immunoreactivity, which are increased in the 
NAc by acute cocaine, were reduced to control levels in chronic cocaine-treated
rats. Fos, Jun, and a number of related proteins activate or repress
transcription of genes by binding to DNA response elements called AP-1 sites. As 
would be expected from the RNA data and immunohistochemistry, acute cocaine
administration increased AP-1 binding activity in the NAc, an effect that
reverted completely to control levels within 8-12 hr. In contrast, AP-1 binding
activity in the NAc of animals treated chronically with cocaine remained elevated
at acute levels 18 hr after the last chronic injection, a time at which c-fos and
c-jun mRNA levels and Fos-like immunoreactivity had returned to control values.
An additional acute cocaine challenge did not further increase AP-1 binding. The 
data suggest that chronic cocaine treatment leads to a persistent increase in

The weak, fine-tuned binding of ubiquitous transcription factors to the Il-2
enhancer contributes to its T cell-restricted activity.

The T lymphocyte-specific enhancers of the murine and human Interleukin 2 (Il-2) 
genes harbour several binding sites for ubiquitous transcription factors. All
these sites for the binding of AP-1, NF-kB or Oct-1 are non-canonical sites, i.e.
they differ in one or a few base pairs from consensus sequences for the optimal
binding of these factors. Although the factors bind weakly to these sites, the
latter are functionally important because their mutation to non-binding sites
results in a decrease of inducible activity of the Il-2 enhancer. Conversion of
three sites to canonical binding sites of Octamer factors, AP-1 and NF-kB results
in a drastic increase in enhancer activity and the induction of the Il-2 enhancer
in non-T cells, such as B cell lines, murine L cells and human HeLa cells. The
introduction of two or three canonical sites into the enhancer leads to a further
increase of its activity. Il-2 enhancer induction is also observed in B cells
when the concentration of AP-1 and Oct factors increases as a result of
cotransfections with FosB and Octamer expression plasmids. When Il-2 enhancer
constructs carrying canonical factor binding sites were injected into Xenopus
oocytes the strong binding of ubiquitous factors substantially overcomes the
silencing effect of negatively acting factors present in resting primary T
lymphocytes. These results suggest a fine-tuned interplay between ubiquitous and 
lymphoid-specific factors binding to and transactivating the Il-2 enhancer and
show that the binding affinity of ubiquitous factors to the enhancer contributes 
to its cell-type specific activity. Moreover, we believe that a dramatic increase
of transcriptional activity brought about by single point mutations at strategic 
important factor binding sites may also have relevance to the activation of
nuclear oncogenes.

Establishment of an osteogenic cell line derived from adult mouse bone marrow
stroma by use of a recombinant retrovirus.

(1)University of Antwerp, UIA, Department of Biochemistry, Belgium.

In order to characterize fibroblastic colony-forming units (CFU-F) from murine
bone marrow in relation to osteogenesis, adherent cells of 7-day-old BALB/c mouse
bone marrow cultures were infected with a recombinant retrovirus (N2/ delta fosB)
containing the bacterial neomycin resistance gene. One of the G418-resistant
clones, MN7, was selected for further analysis on the basis of its high
expression of the bone-specific alkaline phosphatase. The cells have now been in 
culture for more than 1 year and maintain a stable phenotype. The osteogenic
nature of the immortalized clone MN7 was demonstrated as follows: (1)
Mineralization was detected by 85Sr uptake and with the Von Kossa staining method
only after in vitro cultivation on a collagen type I matrix. (2) Osteoblastic
phenotype markers, including the synthesis of type I collagen, osteonectin, and
the bone-specific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase were expressed in vitro. (3) 
MN7 cells responded to bone effectors such as parathyroid hormone and
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. (4) Intraperitoneal injection of MN7 cells into
1-day-old BALB/c mice produced typical osteosarcomas in all animals. We conclude 
that MN7, derived entirely in vitro from a stromal CFU-F colony, represents a
stable murine osteosarcoma cell line expressing the osteoblastic phenotype and
provides the first direct evidence needed to establish adult mouse
marrow-derived, nonhematopoietic stromal cells as osteoprogenitors.

Transformation by FosB requires a trans-activation domain missing in FosB2 that
can be substituted by heterologous activation domains.

Wisdom R(1), Yen J, Rashid D, Verma IM.

Author information: 
(1)Molecular Biology and Virology Laboratory, Salk Institute, San Diego,
California 92186-5800.

Two functionally distinct proteins derived from the FosB gene by alternative
splicing have recently been described. FosB protein transforms fibroblasts
efficiently, whereas FosB2 protein, a carboxy-terminally truncated form of FosB, 
does not, despite the fact that both proteins can participate in high-affinity,
sequence-specific DNA binding as part of a heterodimeric complex with c-Jun
protein. We show here that the functional difference between these proteins is
the result of the presence of a potent proline-rich transcriptional activation
domain in the carboxy-terminal amino acids unique to FosB. This conclusion is
supported by three lines of evidence: (1) Mutations in the carboxy-terminal
region of FosB that impair transcriptional activation also reduce transforming
potential, despite the fact that DNA binding as part of a complex with c-Jun is
not affected; (2) the carboxy-terminal region unique to FosB functions as an
activation domain when fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4; and (3)
transforming potential can be conferred on FosB2 by fusing any of several
different well-characterized trans-activation domains. These results identify an 
additional functional requirement for transformation by Fos proteins and have
implications for the mechanism(s) of mitogenic signaling by the AP-1
transcription complex.

A total of 116,118 basepairs (bp) derived from three cosmids spanning the ERCC1
locus of human chromosome 19q13.3 have been sequenced with automated
fluorescence-based sequencers and analysed by polymerase chain reaction
amplification and computer methods. The assembled sequence forms two contigs
totalling 105,831 bp, which contain a human fosB proto-oncogene, a gene encoding 
a protein phosphatase, two genes of unknown function and the
previously-characterized ERCC1 DNA repair gene. This light band region has a high
average density of 1.4 Alu repeats per kilobase. Human chromosome light bands
could therefore contain up to 75,000 genes and 1.5 million Alu repeats.

Analysis of the AP-1 sites in the IL-2 promoter.

Jain J(1), Valge-Archer VE, Rao A.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Tumour Virology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.

We have investigated the role of the two AP-1 sites, located at approximately
-150 and -180 bp relative to the transcription start site, in induction of the
IL-2 promoter through the TCR/CD3 complex. We show that only the proximal (-150
bp) AP-1 site is functional in vitro, as judged by its ability to bind nuclear
proteins from T cells stimulated with Ag or anti-CD3 epsilon. The inducible
nuclear proteins binding to this site have the characteristics of AP-1, as judged
by their kinetics of induction, the ability to compete and be competed
efficiently by a metallothionein AP-1 site oligonucleotide, and their reaction
with antibodies to Fos and Jun proteins. Mutations in the proximal AP-1 site
greatly diminish or abrogate induction of the IL-2 promoter, indicating that the 
site is also functional in vivo. Although the distal (-180 bp) AP-1 site is
incapable of direct binding to nuclear proteins from activated T cells, a
mutation in this site diminishes IL-2 promoter induction, suggesting that this
site may also be functional in vivo. Cotransfection of a 5' IL-2-chloramphenicol 
acetyltransferase plasmid with c-Fos and/or c-Jun enhances the induction of
IL-2-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity, confirming that the IL-2
promoter contains a functional AP-1 site. Both AP-1 sites may be targets for
c-Fos action, as inferred from the results of experiments in which c-Fos was
cotransfected with internal deletion mutants of the IL-2 promoter lacking either 
AP-1 site. Northern analysis indicates that mRNAs for at least six members of the
Fos/Jun family (c-fos, fosB, fra-1, c-jun, junB, and junD) are expressed in
activated Ar-5 cells; thus the AP-1 sites of the IL-2 promoter may bind different
dimeric Fos/Jun complexes at different times after T cell activation, perhaps
mediating both positive and negative regulation of the IL-2 promoter.

We have determined the genomic structure of the fosB gene and shown that it
consists of 4 exons and 3 introns at positions also found in the c-fos gene. By
deletion analysis we have characterized a region upstream of the TATA box which
is the promoter region of the gene. Several consensus sequences have been
identified, including an SRE and AP-1 binding site whose relative positions are
identical to those in the 5' upstream region of the c-fos gene. We have also
shown that FosB and c-Fos can downregulate the activity of the fosB promoter to a
similar extent. The fosB gene is located in the [A1-B1] region of mouse
chromosome 7.

12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate--induced levels of AP-1 proteins: a 46-kDa

Cancer Research and Development Center, MD 21702.

Neoplastic transformation and transcriptional activation by activator protein-1
(AP-1) complex are stimulated by tumor-promoting agents in promotion-sensitive
(P+) but not promotion-resistant (P-) mouse epidermal JB6 cells in culture. This 
implicates AP-1 as a specific regulator of signal transduction pathways in the
promotion phase of neoplastic transformation. We therefore hypothesized that the 
defective P- responsiveness may be due to limiting levels of AP-1 protein
components in those cells. In this investigation, steady-state levels of AP-1
protein components were measured by immunoprecipitating proteins from
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-treated P+ and P- cells to discern
what may limit the AP-1 response. Whereas the AP-1 proteins junB, junD, and fosB 
did not show differential basal or TPA-inducible levels in P+ and P- cells, a
46-kDa species precipitated by anti-fra-1 antibody was TPA-inducible in P- cells 
but not in P+ cells, and c-jun protein was present at higher levels in
TPA-treated and untreated P+ cells than in P- cells. These data raise the
possibility that the 46-kDa fra-1-related protein may be a negative modulator of 
AP-1 activity and suggest that elevated levels of this 46-kDa species and
limiting levels of c-jun may significantly impair AP-1 function or transformation
response in P- cells or both.

Both products of the fosB gene, FosB and its short form, FosB/SF, are
transcriptional activators in fibroblasts.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Biology, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research 
Institute, Princeton, New Jersey 08543-4000.

We demonstrate that a member of the fos family, the fosB gene, gives rise to two 
transcripts by alternative splicing of exon 4, generating two proteins, FosB of
338 amino acids and a short form, FosB/SF, which contains the DNA binding and
dimerization domains but not the 101 amino acids of the C terminus. FosB/SF
activates an AP-1-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct in NIH 3T3 cells,
as determined by transient and stable transfections, although more weakly than
does FosB. In contrast to FosB, FosB/SF has lost its ability to repress the dyad 
symmetry element of the c-fos gene. FosB/SF when expressed in excess to FosB can 
downmodulate the activity of FosB. Constitutive expression of high levels of
FosB/SF in NIH 3T3 cells has no significant inhibitory effect in the induction of
cell proliferation or cell cycle progression, indicating that FosB/SF is not a
negative regulator of cell growth. This conclusion is further confirmed by the
observation that the majority of the Jun molecules are complexed with FosB/SF in 
the FosB/SF-overexpressing cells.

The distribution of the fosB gene, coding for fosfomycin resistance, in 105
fosfomycin-resistant isolates of Staphylococcus from various geographical areas, 
was studied by Southern blot hybridization. Nucleotide sequences related to fosB 
were detected in 36 strains belonging to five species. Plasmids bearing fosB were
often of a size similar to that of pIP1842 (2.54 kb) in S. epidermidis, most
often small (2.4 to 4.1 kb) in other species including S. aureus where a 2.7-kb
plasmid was found in 16 out of the 18 strains studied. The fosB gene was
geographically dispersed since it was present in six different locations in
France and also in Japan. The weak hybridization observed with plasmid DNA of
certain strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. saprophyticus, 
and S. warneri may indicate gene heterogeneity for fosfomycin resistance in
Staphylococcus spp.

We have established Rat-1A cell lines constitutively expressing c-Fos and the two
products of the fosB gene, FosB and its short form, FosB/SF. The expressed
proteins in the different stable transfectants have been characterized by
immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation analysis. Our results demonstrate that
constitutive expression of FosB, like the constitutive expression of c-Fos and,
to a lesser extent, FosB/SF, results in cells that grow to increased saturation
densities and have the ability to grow in an anchorage-independent manner. Most
important is the finding that expression of these proteins augments the
tumorigenic potential of Rat-1A cells. These results show that both forms of FosB
have a stimulatory effect on cell proliferation.

The jun and fos protein families are both required for cell cycle progression in

Institute, Princeton, New Jersey 08543-4000.

The expression of different members of the Jun and Fos families of transcription 
factors is rapidly induced following serum stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts. 
To determine whether these proteins are required for cell cycle progression, we
microinjected affinity-purified antibodies directed against c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1,
c-Jun, JunB, and JunD, and antibodies that recognize either the Fos or the Jun
family of proteins, into Swiss 3T3 cells and determined their effects in cell
cycle progression by monitoring DNA synthesis. We found that microinjection of
anti-Fos and anti-Jun family antibodies efficiently blocked the entrance to the S
phase of serum-stimulated or asynchronously growing cells. However, the
antibodies against single members of the Fos family only partially inhibited DNA 
synthesis. In contrast, all three Jun antibodies prevented DNA synthesis more
effectively than did any of the anti-Fos antibodies.

Alternative splicing of fosB transcripts results in differentially expressed
mRNAs encoding functionally antagonistic proteins.

Mumberg D(1), Lucibello FC, Schuermann M, Müller R.

Author information: 
(1)Institut für Molekularbiologie und Tumorforschung (IMT), Philipps-Universität 
Marburg, Germany.

We show that serum-stimulated fibroblasts transiently express two different forms
of fosB mRNA, which are generated by alternative splicing of the transcript from 
a single gene. In addition to the known long form (fosB-L), encoding a protein of
338 amino acids (FosB-L), a second shorter form (fosB-S) with a deletion of 140
bp was detected. This deletion creates a stop codon 3' to the leucine repeat,
giving rise to a protein of 237 amino acids (FosB-S) lacking the carboxyl
terminus of FosB-L. Only the long FosB form efficiently induces transformation in
mouse and rat fibroblast cell lines and trans-represses the c-fos promoter. Both 
of these functions are suppressed by coexpressed FosB-S. Upon serum stimulation, 
maximum expression of the oncogenic fosB-L form precedes the expression of the
antagonistic fosB-S form, indicating a new mechanisms regulating the action of
members of the Fos family. However, FosB-L and FosB-S do not differ in all
trans-regulatory properties: Trans-activation of a 5x TRE-CAT reporter construct 
in HeLa and NIH-3T3 cells was found with both FosB forms. These observations
suggest a correlation between fosB-induced transformation and trans-repression,
thus pointing to different mechanisms involved in transformation by fosB and
c-fos/v-fos.

An alternative spliced form of FosB is a negative regulator of transcriptional
activation and transformation by Fos proteins.

Author information: 
(1)Molecular Biology and Virology Laboratory, Salk Institute, San Diego, CA
92186-5800.

Two forms of FosB transcript and their products can be identified in mouse NIH
3T3 cells following serum induction. The larger RNA codes for a 338-amino acid
protein, whereas the smaller RNA results from the removal of an additional 140
nucleotides from FosB mRNA by alternative splicing. This alternative splicing
event places a stop codon following the "leucine zipper" region and results in a 
shorter protein (FosB2) of 237 amino acids that lacks 101 amino acids at the
carboxyl terminus. FosB2 is able to form heterodimers with c-Jun and bind to an
AP-1 site but is not able to activate the transcription of promoters containing
AP-1 sites. Furthermore, FosB2 can not only suppress the transcriptional
activation by c-Fos and c-Jun of promoters containing an AP-1 site but also
interferes with the transforming potential of viral and cellular Fos proteins. We
propose that FosB2 protein functions as a trans-negative regulator.

Expression of different Jun and Fos proteins during the G0-to-G1 transition in

Kovary K(1), Bravo R.

Author information:

Pharmaceutical Research, Princeton, New Jersey 08543-4000.

We have characterized the expression of c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, and FosB
proteins following serum stimulation of quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells by
immunoprecipitation analyses. The synthesis of the three Jun proteins rapidly
increases following stimulation, remaining at a significant level for at least 8 
h. JunB protein presents the highest expression of all. FosB, like c-Fos, is
transiently induced. Pulse-chase experiments show that all of the proteins except
JunD are short-lived. We have shown that c-Fos and FosB form complexes in vivo
with the different Jun proteins and that JunB complexes are predominant. In vitro
association and competition experiments show that the affinities between the
different Fos and Jun proteins are similar. This finding, together with the in
vivo observations described above, suggests that the proportion of the different 
Jun/Fos heterodimers is governed by the concentration of the different
components. The Fos and Jun proteins are phosphoproteins, and some remain
relatively highly phosphorylated in their heterodimeric form.

fosB is a transforming gene encoding a transcriptional activator.

Schuermann M(1), Jooss K, Müller R.

Author information: 
(1)Institut für Molekularbiologie und Tumorforschung (IMT) Philipps-Universität
Marburg, Federal Republic of Germany.

The fosB gene encodes a nuclear protein that shows a high degree of homology with
c-Fos in several of the known functionally crucial domains, e.g., the leucine
zipper and the DNA-binding site, but shows considerable divergence in other
regions. Here, we report that FosB, when placed under the control of a
constitutive promoter, exhibits clear transforming properties in focus assays
using mouse NIH3T3 or rat 208F fibroblasts. The transforming potential of FosB is
considerably stronger than that of a corresponding c-fos construct and resembles 
that of viral fos genes. Using chimeric fos/fosB constructs we show that the
C-terminal half of FosB is responsible for these stronger transforming
properties, apparently by giving rise to significantly higher levels of protein
as compared with the corresponding c-fos sequence. Surprisingly, substitution of 
the N-terminus of Fos with that of FosB decreases its transforming potential.
These differences in the transforming potential are not related to DNA or protein
expression, but rather seem to reflect differences in the molecular function(s)
encoded in the N-terminal halves of Fos and FosB protein. Both, fosB- and v-fos
transformed cells show increased expression of a number of endogenous genes,
including c-jun, transin, alpha 1(III) collagen and tissue plasminogen activator.
Transactivation by FosB and v-fos of the c-jun and alpha 1(III) collagen gene
promoters and of a 3 x TRE-tk chimeric promoter could be shown in transient CAT
assays. v-Fos, but not FosB-transformed cells, also show elevated levels of
urokinase and plasminogen activator inhibitor mRNAs, pointing to potential
differences in the gene regulatory properties of the two Fos family members.

Concomitant induction of signal transduction pathways and genetic instability by 
the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate.

Boesen JJ(1), Lohman PH, Simons JW.

Author information: 
(1)MGC-Department of Radiation Genetics and Chemical Mutagenesis, State
University of Leiden, The Netherlands.

The hypothesis that activation of the signal transduction pathways by
environmental stress may lead to genetic instability was tested. Mouse T-lymphoma
cells, GRSL13, were treated with the tumor promoter
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The induction of transcription of
c-fos, fosB, c-jun, junB and collagenase was studied as well as the mutation rate
in the progeny of treated cells. It was found that mRNA levels of fosB, junB and 
collagenase, all known to be involved in the growth factor signal transduction
pathway, were enhanced. No transcription of c-fos and c-jun was observed in
control and TPA-treated cells. These results suggest that transcription of c-fos 
is not a prerequisite for the induction of transcription of collagenase. The
degree of induction of the signal transduction pathway was dependent on culture
conditions of the treated cells, growing cells having less response than
stationary cells. The mutation rate was significantly enhanced in the progeny of 
TPA-treated cells from 4.2 X 10(-7) to 9.8 X 10(-7)/cell/generation. Fluctuation 
analysis showed that TPA leads to a temporary enhancement of the mutation rate up
to the eighth generation after treatment. The enhancement of the mutation rate is
less apparent in growing cells than in stationary cells (1.8- and 2.9-fold
respectively) which, because the signal transduction pathways are less induced in
growing cells than in stationary cells, is in agreement with the hypothesis that 
induction of the signal transduction pathway leads to genetic instability.

A naturally occurring truncated form of FosB that inhibits Fos/Jun
transcriptional activity.

Nakabeppu Y(1), Nathans D.

Author information: 
(1)Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 
Baltimore, Maryland 21205.

Fos and Jun transcription factors are induced by a variety of extracellular
signaling agents. We describe here an unusual member of the Fos family that is
also induced, namely, a truncated form of FosB (delta FosB) missing the
C-terminal 101 amino acids of FosB. delta FosB retains the dimerization and
DNA-binding activities of FosB but has lost the ability in transfection assays to
activate a promoter with an AP-1 site and to repress the c-fos promoter. Rather, 
delta FosB inhibits gene activation by Jun or Jun + Fos and inhibits repression
of the c-fos promoter by FosB or c-Fos, presumably by competing with full-length 
Fos proteins at the steps of dimerization with Jun and binding to DNA. In
stimulated cells delta FosB may act to limit the transcriptional effects of Fos
and Jun proteins.

Stage and tissue-specific expression of fosB during mouse development.

Redemann-Fibi B(1), Schuermann M, Müller R.

Author information: 
(1)Institut für Molekularbiologie und Tumorforschung (IMT), Phillips-Universität 
Marburg, Federal Republic of Germany.

The product of the fos-related fosB gene shares many properties with c-Fos such
as inducibility by growth factors, complex formation with members of the Jun
family and cooperative binding with Jun to the TPA response element (TRE). To
investigate whether in contrast to these functional similarities, the two genes
might be differentially regulated, we have analysed the expression of fosB during
mouse development by in situ hybridization. A spatially restricted accumulation
of fosB mRNA in the visceral yolk sac and the nervous system was observed during 
late gestation. The highest levels of fosB mRNA were found in the cortex and the 
dorsal columns of the spinal cord. Moreover, stage-specific expression was seen
in sensory organs such as retina and vibrissae, where the levels of fosB RNA
either increased (retina) or decreased (vibrissae) between days 15 and 18. Our
results suggest that fosB may have a specific function in the development of
ectoderm-derived tissues. Expression of fosB during prenatal development differs 
markedly from the known expression pattern of c-fos, pointing to different
tissue-specific functions for c-fos and fosB.

The myeloid interleukin-3 (IL-3) dependent cell line, FDC-P1, enters the G0 stage
of the cell cycle after IL-3 deprivation for 24 hr. The expression of 13
protooncogenes and immediate-early genes was compared with 4 "control" genes
after the addition of either IL-3 or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) to
IL-3-deprived cells. mRNA transcripts encoding c-myc and the T-cell receptor
c-gamma gene were induced to high levels only after IL-3 addition, whereas c-fos,
fos-B, c-jun, jun-B, Krox-20, and Krox-24 were induced transiently only after PMA
addition. The remaining genes (fra-1, p53, jun-D, c-Ha-ras, c-Ki-ras, c-raf,
beta-actin, ornithine decarboxylase, and histone 2B) were detected after culture 
with either IL-3 or PMA. When cells were serum- and IL-3-deprived, c-fos, fos-B, 
c-jun, jun-B, Krox-20, and Krox-24 were detected after exposure to either serum
or PMA. Moreover, culture with cycloheximide and PMA resulted in superinduction
of these genes, whereas cycloheximide and IL-3 addition did not. mRNAs encoding
these genes had half-lives of 10-20 min after PMA treatment, whereas that of
beta-actin was longer (greater than 2 hr), suggesting that short mRNA half-lives 
contributed to the transient nature of these genes. Although c-fos, fos-B, c-jun,
jun-B, Krox-20, and Krox-24 expression can be detected in IL-3-dependent cells
after exposure to either PMA or serum, these genes were not detected after IL-3
addition, which allows cell-cycle progression. These results document the
existence of IL-3 and PMA-responsive genes and demonstrate that IL-3 and protein 
kinase C agonists can induce distinct patterns of gene expression.

Mutual transrepression of Fos and the glucocorticoid receptor: involvement of a
functional domain in Fos which is absent in FosB.

In this study, we show that Fos protein can repress transactivation by the
glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In addition, we demonstrate that GR is capable of
inhibiting, in a hormone-dependent fashion, Fos-mediated transactivation of AP-1 
dependent transcription. Moreover, repression of the serum response element by
Fos is abolished by the GR in the presence of hormone. Transrepression of
glucocorticoid mediated induction involves a region of Fos, located between amino
acids 40 and 111, to which no function has been previously assigned, and which is
poorly conserved among Fos, FosB and Fra-1. In agreement with this finding, FosB 
is not capable of transrepressing GR activation of transcription, representing
the first functional difference between Fos and FosB. We have mapped the domain
of the GR which is required for repression of AP-1 dependent transcription, to
the region of central DNA binding domain. Our results suggest that Fos and the GR
may form transcriptionally inactive complexes and point to a regulatory
interrelationship between different signal transduction pathways.

Isolation and characterization of fra-2, an additional member of the fos gene
family.

Antiserum raised against a Fos peptide (amino acids Lys-127 to Arg-140 of chicken
c-Fos) recognizes a 46-kDa Fos-related protein in cell lysates of
growth-stimulated chicken embryo fibroblasts. Induction of the 46-kDa protein is 
transient but is slightly prolonged relative to c-Fos following growth
stimulation. Using a mixed oligonucleotide probe encoding the peptide antigen, we
have cloned the chicken genomic locus that encodes this protein and have
determined its gene structure. This locus consists of four exons, each of which
has some homology with the corresponding exons of the chicken c-fos gene, and it 
expresses a 6-kilobase mRNA after growth stimulation. The deduced amino acid
sequence of the gene (323 amino acids) contains a "leucine zipper" and includes
five distinct regions that exhibit strong sequence homology to the recently
identified fos-related antigens Fra-1 (rat) and FosB (mouse) as well as c-Fos.
Since the other regions of the gene have little homology to any of these three
proteins, this gene was named "fra-2." When the fra-2 gene was overexpressed by
an avian retrovirus vector, it caused transformation of chicken embryo
fibroblasts. The fra-2 gene product formed a complex in cells with the c-Jun
protein, indicating that c-fos and fra-2 share biological and biochemical
functions.

Mapping of functional domains in Fos and Jun proteins using epitope-specific
antibodies.

Marburg, Federal Republic of Germany.

A panel of epitope-specific antibodies, directed against c-Fos, c-Jun, and FosB
derived oligopeptide sequences, was generated and used to study the interaction
of Fos and Jun proteins and the binding of the Fos/Jun complex to the AP1-binding
site (TRE). Our results strongly support results previously obtained by
site-directed mutagenesis experiments. The leucine zipper is the major site of
interaction between Fos and Jun. Antibodies directed against this domain of Fos
bound free Fos protein efficiently, but were unable to recognize Fos within the
Fos/Jun complex. In contrast, all other Fos epitope-specific antibodies showed
similar reactivity with both free and complexed Fos. Antibodies directed against 
sequences adjacent to the leucine zipper inhibited formation of the complex. This
may suggest that amino acids in the vicinity of the leucine zipper may also play 
some role in the formation of the protein complex. Binding of Fos/Jun to the TRE 
was inhibited only by antibodies directed against the basic regions in Fos or Jun
previously suggested to represent the DNA binding sites. The fact that very
similar results were obtained by two totally different strategies, i.e.,
mutagenesis experiments and domain mapping using epitope-specific antibodies,
lends strong support to the proposed domain structure of Fos and Jun family
members.

Nucleotide sequence of the fosB gene conferring fosfomycin resistance in
Staphylococcus epidermidis.

France.

We have determined the nucleotide sequence of gene fosB of plasmid pIP1842, which
confers resistant to fosfomycin in Staphylococcus epidermidis BM2641. The
resistance gene was identified as a coding sequence of 417 bases pairs
corresponding to a protein with a calculated Mw of 16,345 daltons. This value is 
in good agreement with that of 15,000, estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis of a bacterial cell-free coupled transcription-translation
system. The fosB gene product exhibits 48% sequence homology with the fosfomycin 
resistance protein FOSA of Enterobacteriaceae. The substitutions are scattered
throughout indicating that the two corresponding genes have diverged from a
common ancestor. Downstream from fosB is located an open reading frame that was
partially sequenced. The deduced amino-acid sequence was 50% homologous to REP
alpha 1, a protein involved in the replication of the Enterococcus faecalis
plasmid pAM alpha 1.

Leucine zippers of fos, jun and GCN4 dictate dimerization specificity and thereby
control DNA binding.

The products of the fos and jun protooncogenes form a stable heterodimer which
binds to the TPA-responsive element (TRE) TGACTCA with high affinity. These two
proteins, together with the yeast GCN4 protein, belong to a growing family of
transcription factors, including FosB, Fra1, JunB and JunD, whose members share a
highly conserved DNA-binding domain. This domain is composed of two structures: a
basic motif, which is thought to bind directly to DNA; and a leucine zipper,
which provides a dimerization interface. Although this domain is highly conserved
in Fos, Jun and GCN4, each of these three proteins has very different relative
affinities for the TRE. To understand these differences, we used
'domain-swapping' experiments designed to test the relative contributions of the 
basic motif and the leucine zipper to TRE-binding affinity. Here we show that
fos, jun and GCN4 have different affinities for the TRE due to differences in the
hetero- or homo-dimerization capacity of their leucine zipper domains; the basic 
motifs of these three proteins have comparable DNA binding potential. These
results indicate that leucine zippers control the types of protein complexes
which can associate with a TRE and regulate gene expression.
