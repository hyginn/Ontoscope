In schizophrenia, cognitive overload is thought to reflect an inability to
suppress non-salient information, a process which is studied using prepulse
inhibition (PPI) of the startle response. PPI is reduced in schizophrenia and
routinely tested in animal models and preclinical trials of antipsychotic drugs. 
However, the underlying neuronal circuitry is not well understood. We used a
novel genetic screen in larval zebrafish to reveal the molecular identity of
neurons that are required for PPI in fish and mice. Ablation or optogenetic
silencing of neurons with developmental expression of the transcription factor
genomic screen homeobox 1 (gsx1) produced profound defects in PPI in zebrafish,
and PPI was similarly impaired in Gsx1 knockout mice. Gsx1-expressing neurons
reside in the dorsal brainstem and form synapses closely apposed to neurons that 
initiate the startle response. Surprisingly, brainstem Gsx1 neurons are primarily
glutamatergic despite their role in a functionally inhibitory pathway. As Gsx1
has an important role in regulating interneuron development in the forebrain,
these findings reveal a molecular link between control of interneuron
specification and circuits that gate sensory information across brain regions.

In the cerebellum, all GABAergic neurons are generated from the Ptf1a-expressing 
ventricular zone (Ptf1a domain). However, the machinery to produce different
types of GABAergic neurons remains elusive. Here we show temporal regulation of
distinct GABAergic neuron progenitors in the cerebellum. Within the Ptf1a domain 
at early stages, we find two subpopulations; dorsally and ventrally located
progenitors that express Olig2 and Gsx1, respectively. Lineage tracing reveals
the former are exclusively Purkinje cell progenitors (PCPs) and the latter
Pax2-positive interneuron progenitors (PIPs). As development proceeds, PCPs
gradually become PIPs starting from ventral to dorsal. In gain- and
loss-of-function mutants for Gsx1 and Olig1/2, we observe abnormal transitioning 
from PCPs to PIPs at inappropriate developmental stages. Our findings suggest
that the temporal identity transition of cerebellar GABAergic neuron progenitors 
from PCPs to PIPs is negatively regulated by Olig2 and positively by Gsx1, and
contributes to understanding temporal control of neuronal progenitor identities.

Neural stem cells (NSCs) typically show efficient self-renewal and selective
differentiation. Their invasion potential, however, is not well studied. In this 
study, Sox2-positive NSCs from the E14.5 rat cortex were found to be non-invasive
and showed only limited migration in vitro. By contrast, FGF2-expanded NSCs
showed a strong migratory and invasive phenotype in response to the combination
of FGF2 and BMP4. Invasive NSCs expressed Podoplanin (PDPN) and p75NGFR (Ngfr) at
the plasma membrane after exposure to FGF2 and BMP4. FGF2 and BMP4 together
upregulated the expression of Msx1, Snail1, Snail2, Ngfr, which are all found in 
neural crest (NC) cells during or after epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), 
but not in forebrain stem cells. Invasive cells downregulated the expression of
Olig2, Sox10, Egfr, Pdgfra, Gsh1/Gsx1 and Gsh2/Gsx2. Migrating and invasive NSCs 
had elevated expression of mRNA encoding Pax6, Tenascin C (TNC), PDPN, Hey1,
SPARC, p75NGFR and Gli3. On the basis of the strongest upregulation in
invasion-induced NSCs, we defined a group of five key invasion-related genes:
Ngfr, Sparc, Snail1, Pdpn and Tnc. These genes were co-expressed and upregulated 
in seven samples of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) compared with normal human
brain controls. Induction of invasion and migration led to low expression of
differentiation markers and repressed proliferation in NSCs. Our results indicate
that normal forebrain stem cells have the inherent ability to adopt a glioma-like
invasiveness. The results provide a novel in vitro system to study stem cell
invasion and a novel glioma invasion model: tumoral abuse of the developmental
dorsoventral identity regulation.

Mice lacking the Dlx1 and Dlx2 homeobox genes (Dlx1/2 mutants) have severe
deficits in subpallial differentiation, including overexpression of the Gsx1 and 
Gsx2 homeobox genes. To investigate whether Gsx overexpression contributes to the
Dlx1/2 mutant phenotypes, we made compound loss-of-function mutants. Eliminating 
Gsx2 function from the Dlx1/2 mutants rescued the increased expression of Ascl1
and Hes5 (Notch signaling mediators) and Olig2 (oligodendrogenesis mediator). In 
addition, Dlx1/2;Gsx2 mutants, like Dlx1/2;Ascl1 mutants, exacerbated the Gsx2
and Dlx1/2 patterning and differentiation phenotypes, particularly in the lateral
ganglionic eminence (LGE) caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE), and septum, including
loss of GAD1 expression. On the other hand, eliminating Gsx1 function from the
Dlx1/2 mutants (Dlx1/2;Gsx1 mutants) did not severely exacerbate their phenotype;
on the contrary, it resulted in a partial rescue of medial ganglionic eminence
(MGE) properties, including interneuron migration to the cortex. Thus, despite
their redundant properties, Gsx1 and -2 have distinct interactions with Dlx1 and 
-2. Gsx2 interaction is strongest in the LGE, CGE, and septum, whereas the Gsx1
interaction is strongest in the MGE. From these studies, and earlier studies, we 
present a model of the transcriptional network that regulates early steps of
subcortical development.

Homeobox genes Gsx1 and Gsx2 differentially regulate telencephalic progenitor
maturation.

Homeobox genes Gsx1 and Gsx2 (formerly Gsh1 and Gsh2) are among the earliest
transcription factors expressed in neuronal progenitors of the lateral ganglionic
eminence (LGE) in the ventral telencephalon. Gsx2 is required for the early
specification of LGE progenitor cells and recently has been shown to specify
different LGE neuronal subtypes at distinct time points. In Gsx2 mutants, Gsx1
compensates, at least in part, for the loss of Gsx2 in the specification of LGE
neuronal subtypes. Because no specific phenotype has been described in Gsx1
mutants, it is unclear what role this factor plays in the development of the
ventral telencephalon. Here, we used a gain-of-function approach to express
either Gsx1 or Gsx2 throughout the telencephalon and found that Gsx1 functions
similarly to Gsx2 in the specification of LGE identity. However, our results show
that Gsx1 and Gsx2 differentially regulate the maturation of LGE progenitors.
Specifically, Gsx2 maintains LGE progenitors in an undifferentiated state,
whereas Gsx1 promotes progenitor maturation and the acquisition of neuronal
phenotypes, at least in part, through the down-regulation of Gsx2. These unique
results indicate that the two closely related Gsx genes similarly regulate LGE
patterning but oppositely control the balance between proliferation and
differentiation in the neuronal progenitor pool.

The Pdx1 or Ipf1 gene encodes an important homeodomain-containing protein with
key roles in pancreas development and function. Mutations in human PDX1 are
implicated in developmental defects and disease of the pancreas. Extensive
research, including genome sequencing, has indicated that Pdx1 is the only member
of its gene family in mammals, birds, amphibians, and ray-finned fish, and with
the exception of teleost fish, this gene forms part of the ParaHox gene cluster
along with Gsx1 and Cdx2. The ParaHox cluster, however, is a remnant of a 4-fold 
genome duplication; the three other ParaHox paralogues lack a Pdx-like gene in
all vertebrate genomes examined to date. We have used bacterial artificial
chromosome cloning and synteny analysis to show that the ancestor of living jawed
vertebrates in fact had more ParaHox genes, including two Pdx genes (Pdx1 and
Pdx2). Surprisingly, the two Pdx genes have been retained in parallel in two
quite distantly related lineages, the cartilaginous fish (sharks, skates, and
chimeras) and the Indonesian coelacanth, Latimeria menadoensis. The Pdx2 gene has
been lost independently in ray-finned fish and in tetrapods.

BACKGROUND: The homeobox gene Gsx2 (formerly Gsh2) is known to regulate
patterning in the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) of the embryonic
telencephalon. In its absence, the closely related gene Gsx1 (previously known as
Gsh1) can partially compensate in the patterning and differentiation of ventral
telencephalic structures, such as the striatum. However, the cellular and
molecular mechanisms underlying this compensation remain unclear.
RESULTS: We show here that in the Gsx2 mutants Gsx1 is expressed in only a subset
of the ventral telencephalic progenitors that normally express Gsx2. Based on the
similarities in the expression of Gsx1 and Ascl1 (Mash1) within the Gsx2 mutant
LGE, we examined whether Ascl1 plays an integral part in the Gsx1-based recovery.
Ascl1 mutants show only modest alterations in striatal development; however, in
Gsx2;Ascl1 double mutants, striatal development is severely affected, similar to 
that seen in the Gsx1;Gsx2 double mutants. This is despite the fact that Gsx1 is 
expressed, and even expands, in the Gsx2;Ascl1 mutant LGE, comparable to that
seen in the Gsx2 mutant. Finally, Notch signaling has recently been suggested to 
be required for normal striatal development. In spite of the fact that Notch
signaling is severely disrupted in Ascl1 mutants, it actually appears to be
improved in the Gsx2;Ascl1 double mutants.
CONCLUSION: These results, therefore, reveal a non-proneural requirement of Ascl1
that together with Gsx1 compensates for the loss of Gsx2 in a subset of LGE
progenitors.
