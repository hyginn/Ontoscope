Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer-binding protein 3 (Hivep3)
suppresses osteoblast differentiation by inducing proteasomal degradation of the 
osteogenesis master regulator Runx2. In this study, we tested the possibility of 
cooperation of Hivep1, Hivep2, and Hivep3 in osteoblast and/or chondrocyte
differentiation. Microarray analyses with ST-2 bone stroma cells demonstrated
that expression of any known osteochondrogenesis-related genes was not commonly
affected by the three Hivep siRNAs. Only Hivep3 siRNA promoted osteoblast
differentiation in ST-2 cells, whereas all three siRNAs cooperatively suppressed 
differentiation in ATDC5 chondrocytes. We further used microarray analysis to
identify genes commonly down-regulated in both MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts and ST-2
cells upon knockdown of Hivep3 and identified asparagine-linked glycosylation 2
(Alg2), which encodes a mannosyltransferase residing on the endoplasmic
reticulum. The Hivep3 siRNA-mediated promotion of osteoblast differentiation was 
negated by forced Alg2 expression. Alg2 suppressed osteoblast differentiation and
bone formation in cultured calvarial bone. Alg2 was immunoprecipitated with
Runx2, whereas the combined transfection of Runx2 and Alg2 interfered with Runx2 
nuclear localization, which resulted in suppression of Runx2 activity.
Chondrocyte differentiation was promoted by Hivep3 overexpression, in concert
with increased expression of Creb3l2, whose gene product is the endoplasmic
reticulum stress transducer crucial for chondrogenesis. Alg2 silencing suppressed
Creb3l2 expression and chondrogenesis of ATDC5 cells, whereas infection of
Alg2-expressing virus promoted chondrocyte maturation in cultured cartilage
rudiments. Thus, Alg2, as a downstream mediator of Hivep3, suppresses
osteogenesis, whereas it promotes chondrogenesis. To our knowledge, this study is
the first to link a mannosyltransferase gene to osteochondrogenesis.

BACKGROUND: To clarify the involvement of HIVEP3 and SOX9 coexpression in
prostate cancer (PCa).
METHODS: A small interfering RNA was used to knockdown SOX9 expression in a PCa
cell line and to analyze the effects of SOX9 inhibition on the expression of
HIVEP3 in vitro. Then, HIVEP3 and SOX9 expression patterns in the human PCa
tissues were detected using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis and immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: We found that the downregulation of SOX9 could inhibit the expression of
HIVEP3 in the PCa cells in vitro. In addition, both HIVEP3 and SOX9 messenger RNA
expression levels in the PCa tissues were significantly higher than those in the 
noncancerous prostate tissues (P=0.006 and P<0.001, respectively). Moreover, the 
immunohistochemical staining scores of HIVEP3 in the PCa tissues with PSA failure
were significantly higher than those without (P=0.042); the increased SOX9
protein expression was more frequently found in the PCa tissues with a high
Gleason score (P=0.045) and a high clinical stage (P=0.012). The tumors showing
the HIVEP3-high/SOX9-high expression more frequently had PSA failure (P=0.024).
When the patients with an HIVEP3 overexpression combined with the SOX9
overexpression, this group had a worse biochemical recurrence-free survival
(P<0.001). Furthermore, the multivariate analysis showed that the HIVEP3/SOX9
coexpression was an independent predictor of an unfavorable biochemical
recurrence-free survival.
CONCLUSION: Our data offer the convincing evidence for the first time that a
combined analysis of HIVEP3 and SOX9 may help to predict the tumor progression
and prognosis of PCa patients. In particular, the overexpression of HIVEP3 in PCa
might partly explain the poor prognosis of patients with an upregulation of SOX9.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies indicate that as many as six genes within the PARK10
region (RNF11, UQCRH, HIVEP3, EIF2B3, USP24, ELAVL4) might modify susceptibility 
or age at onset in Parkinson's disease (PD).
METHODS: We sought to identify new PD susceptibility genes and to validate
previously nominated candidate genes within the PARK10 region using a two-stage
design. We used data from a large, publicly-available genome-wide association
study (GWAS) in the discovery stage (n = 2000 cases and 1986 controls) and data
from three independent studies for the replication stage (total n = 2113 cases
and 2095 controls). Marker density was increased by imputation using HapMap 3 and
1000 Genomes reference panels, and over 40,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) were used in the final analysis. The association between each SNP and PD
was modeled using logistic regression with an additive allele dosage effect and
adjusted for sex, age, and axes of geographical variation.
RESULTS: Although the discovery stage yielded promising findings for SNPs in
several novel genes, including DAB1, none of the results were validated in the
replication stage. Furthermore, in meta-analyses across all datasets no genes
within PARK10 reached significance after accounting for multiple testing.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that common variation in the PARK10 region is not
associated with PD risk. However, additional studies are needed to assess the
role of PARK10 in modifying age at onset and to determine whether rare variants
in this region might affect PD susceptibility.

Mice deficient in Schnurri-3 (SHN3; also known as HIVEP3) display increased bone 
formation, but harnessing this observation for therapeutic benefit requires an
improved understanding of how SHN3 functions in osteoblasts. Here we identified
SHN3 as a dampener of ERK activity that functions in part downstream of WNT
signaling in osteoblasts. A D-domain motif within SHN3 mediated the interaction
with and inhibition of ERK activity and osteoblast differentiation, and knockin
of a mutation in Shn3 that abolishes this interaction resulted in aberrant ERK
activation and consequent osteoblast hyperactivity in vivo. Additionally, in vivo
genetic interaction studies demonstrated that crossing to Lrp5(-/-) mice
partially rescued the osteosclerotic phenotype of Shn3(-/-) mice;
mechanistically, this corresponded to the ability of SHN3 to inhibit ERK-mediated
suppression of GSK3ß. Inducible knockdown of Shn3 in adult mice resulted in a
high-bone mass phenotype, providing evidence that transient blockade of these
pathways in adults holds promise as a therapy for osteoporosis.

Effect of lyso-phosphatidylcholine and Schnurri-3 on osteogenic
transdifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells to calcifying vascular cells
in 3D culture.

BACKGROUND: In vitro cell culture is a widely used technique for investigating a 
range of processes such as stem cell behavior, regenerative medicine, tissue
engineering, and drug discovery. Conventional cell culture is performed in Petri 
dishes or flasks where cells typically attach to a flat glass or plastic surface 
as a cell monolayer. However, 2D cell monolayers do not provide a satisfactory
representation of in vivo conditions. A 3D culture could be a much better system 
for representing the conditions that prevail in vivo.
METHODS AND RESULTS: To simulate 3D conditions, vascular smooth muscle cells
(VSMCs) were loaded with gold-polyvmer-iron oxide hydrogel, enabling levitation
of the cells by using spatially varying magnetic fields. These magnetically
levitated 3D cultures appeared as freely suspended, clustered cells which
proliferated 3-4 times faster than cells in conventional 2D cultures. When the
levitated cells were treated with 10nM lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), for 3days, 
cell clusters exhibited translucent extensions/rods 60-80µm wide and 200-250µm
long. When 0.5µg/µl Schnurri-3 was added to the culture containing LPC, these
extensions were smaller or absent. When excited with 590-650nm light, these
extensions emitted intrinsic fluorescence at >667nm. When the 3D cultures were
treated with a fluorescent probe specific for calcium hydroxyapatite
(FITC-HABP-19), the cell extensions/rods emitted intensely at 518nm, the <U+03BB>max for
FITC emission. Pellets of cells treated with LPC were more enriched in calcium,
phosphate, and glycosaminoglycans than cells treated with LPC and Schnurri-3.
CONCLUSIONS: In 3D cultures, VSMCs grow more rapidly and form larger
calcification clusters than cells in 2D cultures. Transdifferentiation of VSMC
into calcifying vascular cells is enhanced by LPC and attenuated by Schnurri-3.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The formation of calcified structures in 3D VSMC cultures
suggests that similar structures may be formed in vivo.

BACKGROUND: Genetic differences between Indian and Chinese rhesus macaques
contribute to the phenotypic variance of clinical trials, including infection
with SIVmac. The completion of the rhesus genome has facilitated the discovery of
several thousand markers.
METHODS: We developed a genome-wide SNP map for rhesus macaques containing 3869
validated markers with an average distance of 0.88 Mb and used the program VarLD 
to identify genomic areas with significant differences in linkage disequilibrium 
(LD) between Indian-derived and Chinese rhesus macaques.
RESULTS: Forty-one statistically significant differences in LD between Chinese
and Indian-origin rhesus were detected on chromosomes 1, 4, 5 and 11. The region 
of greatest LD difference was located on the proximal end of chromosome one,
which also contained the genes ELAVL4, MAST2 and HIVEP3.
CONCLUSION: These genomic areas provide entry to more detailed studies of gene
function. This method is also applicable to the study of differences in
biomarkers between regional populations of other species.

Harsh tropical environments impose serious challenges on poorly adapted species. 
In beef cattle, tropical adaptation in the form of temperature and disease
resistance, coupled with acclimatization to seasonal and limited forage, comes at
a cost to production efficiency. Prominent among these costs is delayed onset of 
puberty, a challenging phenotype to manipulate through traditional breeding
mechanisms. Recently, system biology approaches, including gene networks, have
been applied to the genetic dissection of complex phenotypes. We aimed at
developing and studying gene networks underlying cattle puberty. Our starting
material comprises the association results of ~50,000 SNP on 22 traits, including
age at puberty, and 2 cattle breed populations: Brahman (n = 843) and Tropical
Composite (n = 866). We defined age at puberty as the age at first corpus luteum 
(AGECL). By capturing the genes harboring mutations minimally associated (P <
0.05) to AGECL or to a set of traits related with AGECL, we derived a gene
network for each breed separately and a third network for the combined data set. 
At the intersection of the 3 networks, we identified candidate genes and pathways
that were common to both breeds. Resulting from these analyses, we identified an 
enrichment of genes involved in axon guidance, cell adhesion, ErbB signaling, and
glutamate activity, pathways that are known to affect pulsatile release of GnRH, 
which is necessary for the onset of puberty. Furthermore, we employed network
connectivity and centrality parameters along with a regulatory impact factor
metric to identify the key transcription factors (TF) responsible for the
molecular regulation of puberty. As a novel finding, we report 5 TF (HIVEP3, TOX,
EYA1, NCOA2, and ZFHX4) located in the network intersecting both breeds and
interacting with other TF, forming a regulatory network that harmonizes with the 
recent literature of puberty. Finally, we support our network predictions with
evidence derived from gene expression in hypothalamic tissue of adult cows.

Genome-wide analysis of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells of minimal change nephrotic syndrome patients.

BACKGROUND: Studies of the epigenome have attracted some interest in nephrology. 
However, to date, our knowledge about the alterations in histone modification in 
minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) is unknown. This study aimed to
investigate the variations in histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with MCNS.
METHODS: H3K4me3 variations were analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, 
from 15 MCNS patients and 15 healthy subjects, using the ChIP-chip approach. ChIP
real-time PCR is used to validate the microarray results. In addition, mRNA
expression and DNA methylation status can also be further analyzed by
quantitative (q) RT-PCR and methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation-q PCR, respectively.
RESULTS: 848 increased and 231 decreased H3K4me3 probes displaying significant
H3K4me3 differences were found in MCNS patients compared with healthy subjects.
The results of ChIP real-time PCR coincided well with the microarray. Expression 
analysis by qRT-PCR revealed positive correlations between mRNA and H3K4me3
levels. DNA methylation alterations were found on selected positive genes (IL4R, 
HIVEP3, HPSE2, CDH13 and PRKD2). In addition, we also found that there is an
inverse relationship between H3K4me3 and promoter DNA methylation in MCNS
patients.
CONCLUSION: Our studies indicate that there are significant alterations of
H3K4me3 in MCNS patients. These significant H3K4me3 candidates may help to
explain the immunological disturbance involved in MCNS patients.

The human orthologue of murine Mpzl3 with predicted adhesive and immune functions
is a potential candidate gene for immune-related hereditary hair loss.

Racz P, Mink M, Ordas A, Cao T, Szalma S, Szauter KM, Csiszar K.

We have recently reported a mutation within the conserved immunoglobulin V-type
domain of the predicted adhesion protein Mpzl3 (MIM 611707) in rough coat (rc)
mice with severe skin abnormalities and progressive cyclic hair loss. In this
study, we tested the hypothesis that the human orthologue MPZL3 on chromosome
11q23.3 is a candidate for similar symptoms in humans. The predicted conserved
MPZL3 protein has two transmembrane motifs flanking an extracellular Ig-like
domain. The R100Q rc mutation is within the Ig-domain recognition loop that has
roles in T-cell receptors and cell adhesion. Results of the rc mouse study, 3D
structure predictions, homology with Myelin Protein Zero and EVA1, comprehensive 
database analyses of polymorphisms and mutations within the human MPZL3 gene and 
its cell, tissue expression and immunostaining pattern indicate that homozygous
or compound heterozygous mutations of MPZL3 might be involved in immune-mediated 
human hereditary disorders with hair loss.

Schnurri-3 is an essential regulator of osteoblast function and adult bone mass.

Skeletal remodelling is a cyclical process where under normal physiological
conditions, bone formation occurs at sites where bone resorption has previously
taken place. Homeostatic remodelling of the skeleton is mediated by osteoclasts, 
giant multinucleated cells of haematopoietic origin that are responsible for bone
resorption and osteoblasts, which originate from mesenchymal stem cells, and
synthesise the matrix constituents on bone-forming surfaces.1 Proliferation,
differentiation and bone remodelling activities of these cells involve a complex 
temporal network of growth factors, signalling proteins and transcription
factors. Dysregulation of any one component may disrupt the remodelling process
and contribute to the pathogenesis of common skeletal disorders, like
osteoporosis and Paget's disease. Rare single gene disorders resulting in
elevated bone mass due to osteoclast defects are collectively termed
osteopetrosis. Rarer still are single gene disorders, collectively termed
osteosclerosis, in which elevated bone mass is due to intrinsically elevated
osteoblast activity.2 While we have learned much about the molecular control of
skeletal formation and remodelling from these mutations, additional genes that
regulate bone mass have yet to be characterised.

Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA. yiju.li@duke.edu

Two recent association mapping studies in Parkinson disease (PD) reported three
candidate genes for the PARK10 locus: EIF2B3 as a modifier of age-at-onset of PD 
(min P= 0.0004) and HIVEP3 as a PD risk gene (P < or = 0.006) (Oliveira et al.
2005); and LOC200008 (CDCP2) identified by the whole genome association (WGA)
study of PD of Maraganore et al. (2005). However, evaluation of the on-line PD
WGA results revealed two significant SNPs in HIVEP3 in the two datasets, Tier 1
and Tier 2, used by Maraganore et al. (P < or = 0.008 for Tier 1 and P=0.03 for
Tier 2 dataset). Here, we revisited both the HIVEP3 and CDCP2 loci by examining
47 SNPs, mostly tagging, in an expanded PD family dataset (293 multiplex and 467 
singleton families). A discordant sibpair (DSP) dataset (one DSP per family),
with similar data structure as the WGA Tier 1 dataset, was also tested. We
confirmed our and other previous negative findings for CDCP2. However, five
significant SNPs in HIVEP3 (min P=0.004) were observed, although the two
significant HIVEP3 SNPs from the PD WGA study were not significant in our
datasets. Even though the sets of significant HIVEP3 markers differ between
studies, these findings strongly support HIVEP3 as a candidate for PARK10.
Further testing of HIVEP3 by other groups is encouraged.

Vascular development of the brain requires beta8 integrin expression in the
neuroepithelium.

Proctor JM(1), Zang K, Wang D, Wang R, Reichardt LF.

Author information: 
(1)Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Physiology, University of
California, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.

We showed previously that loss of the integrin beta8 subunit, which forms
alphavbeta8 heterodimers, results in abnormal vascular development in the yolk
sac, placenta, and brain. Animals lacking the integrin beta8 (itgbeta8) gene die 
either at midgestation, because of insufficient vascularization of the placenta
and yolk sac, or shortly after birth with severe intracerebral hemorrhage. To
specifically focus on the role of integrins containing the beta8 subunit in the
brain, and to avoid early lethalities, we used a targeted deletion strategy to
delete itgbeta8 only from cell types within the brain. Ablating itgbeta8 from
vascular endothelial cells or from migrating neurons did not result in cerebral
hemorrhage. Targeted deletion of itgbeta8 from the neuroepithelium, however,
resulted in bilateral hemorrhage at postnatal day 0, although the phenotype was
less severe than in itgbeta8-null animals. Newborn mice lacking itgbeta8 from the
neuroepithelium had hemorrhages in the cortex, ganglionic eminence, and thalamus,
as well as abnormal vascular morphogenesis, and disorganized glia. Interestingly,
adult mice lacking itgbeta8 from cells derived from the neuroepithelium did not
show signs of hemorrhage. We propose that defective association between vascular 
endothelial cells and glia lacking itgbeta8 is responsible for the leaky
vasculature seen during development but that an unidentified compensatory
mechanism repairs the vasculature after birth.

We previously reported a linkage region on chromosome 1p (LOD = 3.41) for genes
controlling age at onset (AAO) in Parkinson disease (PD). This region overlaps
with the previously reported PARK10 locus. To identify the gene(s) associated
with AAO and risk of PD in this region, we first applied a genomic convergence
approach that combined gene expression and linkage data. No significant results
were found. Second, we performed association mapping across a 19.2-Mb region
centered under the AAO linkage peak. An iterative association mapping approach
was done by initially genotyping single-nucleotide polymorphisms at an average
distance of 100 kb apart and then by increasing the density of markers as needed.
Using the overall data set of 267 multiplex families, we identified six
associated genes in the region, but further screening of a subset of 83 families 
linked to the chromosome 1 locus identified only two genes significantly
associated with AAO in PD: the gamma subunit of the translation initiation factor
EIF2B gene (EIF2B3), which was more significant in the linked subset and the
ubiquitin-specific protease 24 gene (USP24). Unexpectedly, the human
immunodeficiency virus enhancer-binding protein 3 gene (HIVEP3) was found to be
associated with risk for susceptibility to PD. We used several criteria to define
significant results in the presence of multiple testing, including criteria
derived from a novel cluster approach. The known or putative functions of these
genes fit well with the current suspected pathogenic mechanisms of PD and thus
show great potential as candidates for the PARK10 locus.

Schnurri-3 (KRC) interacts with c-Jun to regulate the IL-2 gene in T cells.

Oukka M(1), Wein MN, Glimcher LH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Harvard School of Public
Health, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

The activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor is a key participant in the
control of T cell proliferation, cytokine production, and effector function. In
the immune system, AP-1 activity is highest in T cells, suggesting that a subset 
of T cell-specific coactivator proteins exist to selectively potentiate AP-1
function. Here, we describe that the expression of Schnurri-3, also known as
kappa recognition component (KRC), is induced upon T cell receptor signaling in T
cells and functions to regulate the expression of the interleukin 2 (IL-2) gene. 
Overexpression of KRC in transformed and primary T cells leads to increased IL-2 
production, whereas dominant-negative KRC, or loss of KRC protein in KRC-null
mice, results in diminished IL-2 production. KRC physically associates with the
c-Jun transcription factor and serves as a coactivator to augment AP-1-dependent 
IL-2 gene transcription.

The large zinc finger protein KRC binds to the signal sequences of V(D)J
recombination and the kappaB motif. Disruption of KRC expression in cell lines
resulted in increased cell proliferation, anchorage independence of growth, and
uncoupling of nuclear division and cell division. In this report, the function of
KRC was studied in a RAG2-deficient blastocyst complementation animal model.
KRC-deficient embryonic stem cells were generated by homologous recombination and
were introduced into RAG2(-/-) blastocysts to generate KRC(-/-);RAG2(-/-)
chimeric mice. The lymphoid compartments of chimeras examined at 5 weeks of age
were developed, suggesting that KRC is not essential for V(D)J recombination
development. However, by 6 months of age, there was a marked deficit in
CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes in the chimeras, suggesting that KRC may be involved in
T-lymphocyte survival. Additionally, one chimera developed anomalies, including
postaxial polydactyly, hydronephrosis, and an extragonadal malignant teratoma.
DNA analysis showed that the teratoma was derived from KRC(-/-) embryonic stem
cells. The teratoma had compound tissue organization and was infiltrated with B
lymphocytes. Subsequently, several immortalized KRC-deficient cell lines were
established from the teratoma. In this study, growth anomalies and neoplasia were
observed in animals and cells deficient in KRC, and other studies have shown
allelic loss occurring at the chromosomal region of the human KRC counterpart in 
various tumors. We propose that KRC may be a previously unidentified
tumor-suppresser gene.

The kappa B transcriptional enhancer motif and signal sequences of V(D)J
recombination are targets for the zinc finger protein HIVEP3/KRC: a site
selection amplification binding study.

BACKGROUND: The ZAS family is composed of proteins that regulate transcription
via specific gene regulatory elements. The amino-DNA binding domain (ZAS-N) and
the carboxyl-DNA binding domain (ZAS-C) of a representative family member, named 
kappaB DNA binding and recognition component (KRC), were expressed as fusion
proteins and their target DNA sequences were elucidated by site selection
amplification binding assays, followed by cloning and DNA sequencing. The fusion 
proteins-selected DNA sequences were analyzed by the MEME and MAST computer
programs to obtain consensus motifs and DNA elements bound by the ZAS domains.
RESULTS: Both fusion proteins selected sequences that were similar to the kappaB 
motif or the canonical elements of the V(D)J recombination signal sequences (RSS)
from a pool of degenerate oligonucleotides. Specifically, the ZAS-N domain
selected sequences similar to the canonical RSS nonamer, while ZAS-C domain
selected sequences similar to the canonical RSS heptamer. In addition, both KRC
fusion proteins selected oligonucleoties with sequences identical to heptamer and
nonamer sequences within endogenous RSS.
CONCLUSIONS: The RSS are cis-acting DNA motifs which are essential for V(D)J
recombination of antigen receptor genes. Due to its specific binding affinity for
RSS and kappaB-like transcription enhancer motifs, we hypothesize that KRC may be
involved in the regulation of V(D)J recombination.

ZAS: C2H2 zinc finger proteins involved in growth and development.

Wu LC(1).

Author information:

College of Medicine and Public Health, Columbus 43210, USA. wu.39@osu.edu

A ZAS gene encodes a large protein with two separate C2H2 zinc finger pairs that 
independently bind to specific DNA sequences, including the kappaB motif. Three
paralogous mammalian genes, ZAS1, ZAS2, and ZAS3, and a related Drosophila gene, 
Schnurri, have been cloned and characterized. The ZAS genes encode
transcriptional proteins that activate or repress the transcription of a variety 
of genes involved in growth, development, and metastasis. In addition, ZAS3
associates with a TNF receptor-associated factor to inhibit NF-kappaB- and JNK/
SAPK-mediated signaling of TNF-alpha. Genetic experiments show that ZAS3
deficiency leads to proliferation of cells and tumor formation in mice. The data 
suggest that ZAS3 is important in controlling cell growth, apoptosis, and
inflammation. The potent vasoactive hormone endothelin and transcription factor
AP2 gene families also each consist of three members. The ZAS, endothelin, and
transcription factor AP2 genes form several linkage groups. Knowledge of the
chromosomal locations of these genes provides valuable clues to the evolution of 
the vertebrate genome.

KRC fusion proteins bind to the kappaB enhancer motif and to the signal sequences
of V(D)J recombination. Here we have characterized endogenous KRC in mouse
embryos and lymphoma cell lines. Starting from midgestation, neuronal- and
lymphoid-restricted expression of KRC was observed from the dorsal root ganglia, 
trigeminal ganglion, thymus, and cerebral cortex. Several B-cell lines produced
an alternatively spliced KRC transcript of 4.5 kb and a 115-kDa DNA-binding
protein isoform. Additionally, that KRC transcript was induced by
lipopolysaccharide, a potent activator of cells in immunity and inflammation. In 
genetic-engineered B cells stably transfected with inducible expression vectors
for the recombination activating genes RAG1, RAG2, or both, the avidity of KRC to
DNA was markedly decreased when RAG1 and RAG2 were overexpressed. We hypothesize 
that KRC may function in developing thymocytes and neurons, where its role might 
be transcription regulation or DNA recombination.

The cytokine TNFalpha launches cascades of gene activation that control
inflammation and apoptosis through NFkappaB and JNK/SAPK signal transduction
pathways. Here we describe a function for the zinc finger transcription factor
kappa recognition component (KRC) in regulating patterns of gene activation in
response to proinflammatory stimuli. We demonstrate that KRC overexpression
inhibits while antisense or dominant-negative KRC enhances NFkappaB-dependent
transactivation and JNK phosphorylation and consequently, apoptosis and cytokine 
gene expression. The effect of KRC is mediated through its interaction with the
adaptor protein TRAF2, which intersects both pathways. KRC is a hitherto
unrecognized participant in the signal transduction pathway leading from the TNF 
receptor to gene activation and may play a critical role in inflammatory and
apoptotic responses.

Somatic V(D)J recombination of the immune receptor genes is mediated by the
recombination signal sequence (RSS) and the recombination-activating genes RAG1
and RAG2. Previously, proteins binding specifically to the RSS have been
characterized in nuclear extracts of T and B lymphocytes. Further elucidation of 
the role of those RSS-binding proteins in V(D)J recombination, however, has been 
hampered by the fact that their identities have not been established. Here, we
show that the major RSS-binding protein present in the nuclear extracts of B
lymphocytes is an Mr 135,000 species. Notably, its affinity for the RSS decreased
when RAG1 and RAG2 were induced. In immunoblot analyses and gel supershift
assays, we showed that KRC antisera react with the Mr 135,000 RSS-binding
protein. We previously cloned KRC from a thymocyte expression library using
32P-RSS as a ligand and showed that KRC fusion proteins bind specifically to the 
RSS and to the kappaB enhancer motif. The lymphoid expression and DNA-binding
characteristics suggest that KRC may be involved in lymphocyte development.

A key step in T cell development involves the positive selection of cells that
recognize antigen presented by self-major histocompatibility complex. Yet, the
signals that are activated by T cell receptor engagement and lead to cell
survival remain unclear. We show here that mice lacking the transcription factor 
Schnurri-2 (Shn-2), a large metal-finger protein, had severely defective positive
selection of CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Drosophila Shn acts as a cofactor of Smad
homolog and is required for Decapentaplegic signaling. Vertebrates have at least 
three Shn orthologs (Shn-1, Shn-2 and Shn-3), which are thought to act as nuclear
targets in the bone morphogenetic protein-transforming growth factor-beta-activin
signaling pathways. These data raised the possibility that the Smad-Shn-2 complex
is involved in the thymic selection of T cells.

Characterization of Sp1, AP-1, CBF and KRC binding sites and minisatellite DNA as
functional elements of the metastasis-associated mts1/S100A4 gene intronic
enhancer.

The mts1/S100A4 gene encodes a small acidic calcium-binding protein that is
expressed in a cell-specific manner in development, tumorigenesis and certain
tissues of adult mice. A composite enhancer that is active in murine mammary
adenocarcinoma cells was previously identified in the first intron of the
mts1/S100A4 gene. Here we present a detailed analysis of the structure and
function of this enhancer in the Mts1/S100A4-expressing CSML100 and
non-expressing CSML0 mouse adenocarcinoma cell lines. In CSML100 cells the
enhancer activity is composed of at least six cis-elements interacting with Sp1
and AP-1 family members and CBF/AML/PEBP2 and KRC transcription factors. In
addition, a minisatellite-like DNA sequence significantly contributes to the
enhancer activity via interaction with abundant proteins, which likely have been 
described previously under the name minisatellite-binding proteins. Extensive
mutational analysis of the mts1/S100A4 enhancer revealed a cooperative function
of KRC and the factors binding minisatellite DNA. This is the first example of an
enhancer where two nuclear factors earlier implicated in different recombination 
processes cooperate to activate transcription. In Mts1/S100A4-negative CSML0
cells the strength of the enhancer was 7- to 12.5-fold lower compared to that in 
CSML100 cells, when referred to the activities of three viral promoters. In CSML0
cells the enhancer could be activated by exogenous AP-1 and CBF transcription
factors.

Structure of the human zinc finger protein HIVEP3: molecular cloning, expression,
exon-intron structure, and comparison with paralogous genes HIVEP1 and HIVEP2.

Hicar MD(1), Liu Y, Allen CE, Wu LC.

Author information:

Medicine and Public Health, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.

Here we report the cloning and characterization of HIVEP3, the newest member in
the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer-binding protein family that
encodes large zinc finger proteins and regulates transcription via the kappaB
enhancer motif. The largest open reading frame of HIVEP3 contains 2406 aa. and is
approximately 80% identical to the mouse counterpart. The HIVEP3 gene is located 
in the chromosomal region 1p34 and is at least 300 kb with 10 exons. RNA studies 
show that multiple HIVEP3 transcripts are differentially expressed and regulated.
Additionally, transcription termination occurs in the ultimate exon, exon 10, or 
in exon 6. Therefore, HIVEP3 may produce protein isoforms that contain or exclude
the carboxyl DNA binding domain and the leucine zipper by alternative RNA
splicing and differential polyadenylation. Sequence homologous to HIVEP3 exon 6
is not found in mouse nor are the paralogous genes HIVEP1 and HIVEP2. Zoo-blot
analysis suggests that sequences homologous to the human exon 6 are present only 
in primates and cow. Therefore, a foreign DNA harboring a termination exon likely
was inserted into the HIVEP3 locus relatively recently in evolution, resulting in
the acquisition of novel gene regulatory mechanisms as well as the generation of 
structural and functional diversity.

The large zinc finger protein KRC regulates transcription of target genes via the
kappaB gene enhancer element. As an attempt to investigate the cellular function 
of KRC, we have established cell lines stably transfected with KRC expression
vectors. Introduction of a vector directing expression of a transcript antisense 
to KRC mRNAs in several mammalian cell lines resulted in accelerated
proliferation. Furthermore, in HeLa cells, downregulation of KRC conferred
anchorage-independent growth and promoted cell cycle progression without an
intervening cytokinesis, culminating in the formation of multinucleated giant
cells. Ultimately these cells died.

A kappaB-like sequence, Sb, is integral to the composite enhancer located in the 
first intron of the metastasis-associated gene, S100A4/mts1. Oligonucleotides
containing this sequence form three specific complexes with nuclear proteins
prepared from S100A4/mts1-expressing CSML100 adenocarcinoma cells. Protein
studies show the Sb-interacting complexes include NF-kappaB/Rel proteins, p50.p50
and p50.p65 dimers. Additionally, the Sb sequence was bound by an unrelated
approximately 200-kDa protein, p200. Site-directed mutagenesis in conjunction
with transient transfections indicate that p200, but not the NF-kappaB/Rel
proteins, transactivates S100A4/mts1. To identify candidate genes for p200,
double-stranded DNA probes containing multiple copies of Sb were used to screen a
randomly primed lambdagt11 cDNA expression library made from CSML100 poly(A)(+)
RNA. Two clones corresponding to the DNA-binding proteins KRC and Alf1 were
identified. KRC encodes a large zinc finger protein that binds to the kappaB
motif and to the signal sequences of V(D)J recombination. In vitro DNA binding
assays using bacterially expressed KRC fusion proteins, demonstrate specific
binding of KRC to the Sb sequence. In addition, introduction of KRC expression
vectors into mammalian cells induces expression of S100A4/mts1 and reporter genes
driven by S100A4/mts1 gene regulatory sequences. These data indicate that KRC
positively regulates transcription of S100A4/mts1.

Erratum in
    Nucleic Acids Res 1999 Nov 15;27(22):following 4531.

The DNA binding protein KRC (forkappaB binding andrecognitioncomponent of the
V(D)J recombination signal sequence) belongs to a family of large zinc finger
proteins that bind to the kappaB motif and contains two widely separated DNA
binding structures. In addition to the kappaB motif, KRC fusion proteins bind to 
the signal sequences of V(D)J recombination to form highly ordered complexes.
Here, we report that KRC may be regulated by post-translational modifications.
Specific protein kinases present in the nucleus of pre-B cells phosphorylated a
KRC fusion protein at tyrosine and serine residues. Such protein modifications
increased DNA binding, thereby providing a mechanism by which KRC responds to
signal transduction pathways. KRC is a substrate of epidermal growth factor
receptor kinase and P34cdc2 kinase in vitro. Our results suggest that activation 
of the KRC family of transcription factors may provide a mechanism by which
oncogenic tyrosine kinases regulate genes with kappaB-controlled gene regulatory 
elements.

KRC transcripts: identification of an unusual alternative splicing event.

Avenue, Columbus OH 43210, USA.

Mouse KRC is a large zinc finger protein that binds to the kappaB motif of gene
transcription and to the recognition signal sequences for the somatic
recombination of the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene segments. The mouse 
KRC gene is more than 70 kilobases (kb) in size, and contains at least seven
exons, with the largest transcript being approximately 9.5 kb. Multiple
differentially spliced transcripts of KRC were identified in thymus and brain,
which would result in the production of multiple KRC protein isoforms with
different N-termini and number of DNA binding domains. Alternative splicing
events leading to the production of these multiple transcripts have been
elucidated. Of particular interest are the exclusions in some transcripts of
sequences from a gigantic exon of 5487 base pairs (bp), or from an exon of 176
bp. Both potentially deleted exons code for zinc finger motifs that are essential
components of the N-terminal and C-terminal DNA binding domains, respectively.
Another intriguing phenomenon found in some KRC transcripts is the skipping of a 
459 bp fragment within the gigantic exon that would code for the N-terminal DNA
binding domain. Bacterial fusion proteins derived from this fragment bind
specifically to KRC target DNAs. Apparently, distinct alternative splicing events
could eliminate the N-terminal DNA binding domain of KRC.

The mouse DNA binding protein Rc for the kappa B motif of transcription and for

interaction domains and belongs to a new family of large transcriptional
proteins.

Rc is a DNA binding protein with dual specificities for the V(D)J recombination
signal sequences and for the B motif of the immunoglobulin kappa chain gene
enhancer. The largest Rc transcript present in lymphoid cells/tissues is
approximately 9 kb. Molecular cloning and sequence determination for 8822 bp of
mouse Rc cDNA revealed an open reading frame of 2282 amino acids and long 5'- and
3'-untranslated regions. The derived amino acid sequence contains multiple DNA
and protein interaction domains. Composite ZAS structures with tandem zinc
fingers, an acidic motif, and a Ser/Thr-rich segment are located near the
N-terminal and the C-terminal regions. The middle region of Rc contains a lone
zinc finger, an acidic motif, a Ser-rich region, a nucleus localization signal,
and GTPase motifs. Cloning and characterization of a mouse Rc gene show that the 
Rc cDNA corresponds to seven exons located in a genomic region spanning 70 kb.
Exon 2 is exceptionally large, with 5487 bp. cDNA cloning and Northern blot
analyses revealed multiple Rc transcripts, probably generated by alternative
splicings. Sequence comparisons show that Rc belongs to a ZAS protein family that
is involved in gene transcription and/or DNA recombination. The major
histocompatibility complex class I gene enhancer binding proteins MBP1 and MBP2
are other representatives of this ZAS protein family.

The V(D)J recombination signal sequence and kappa B binding protein Rc binds DNA 
as dimers and forms multimeric structures with its DNA ligands.

State University, Columbus 43210.

The murine DNA binding protein Rc binds to the heptamer motif of the V(D)J
recombination signal sequences and to the kappa B motif of the immunoglobulin
enhancer. Bacterial fusion proteins for Rc and DNA ligands of Rc form multiple
protein-DNA complexes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Large
complexes formation is favored by an increased Rc concentration. In order to
determine the architecture of these complexes, the apparent molecular weights of 
the protein-DNA complexes were first determined by their gel mobilities. The data
suggest that Rc binds to its DNA ligands as dimers, tetramers, and multiples of
tetramers. The inference that Rc binds DNA as dimers was substantiated by the
formation of chimeric complexes when two electrophoretically distinguishable Rc
proteins were employed in EMSA. Methylation interference experiments show that
there are no contiguous protein binding sites evident in the DNA of the larger
complexes. Apparently, multimerization occurs via protein-protein interactions.
Such interaction was demonstrated by the formation of Rc dimers and tetramers in 
a chemical crosslinking experiment. Significantly, the multimerization of
DNA-bound Rc could be involved in bringing the variable region gene segments
together for the somatic V(D)J recombination.

Author information: 
(1)Medical Research Council, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK.

The somatic V(D)J recombination for the assembly of the Ig and TCR genes is
mediated by the recombination signal sequences (Rss) and the V(D)J recombinase. A
cDNA clone was isolated from a lambda gt11 expression library made from mouse
thymocyte poly(A)+ RNA, using the Rss as a ligand. The deduced amino acid
sequence of the putative protein, designated Recognition component (Rc), reveals 
a pair of Cys2-His2 zinc fingers followed by a Glu- and Asp-rich acidic domain.
In addition, there are five copies of the Ser/Thr-Pro-X-Arg/Lys sequence, which
are putative DNA binding units. The zinc finger-acidic domain structures present 
in Rc are also found in several enhancer binding proteins, such as those for the 
kappa B motif of the Ig kappa light chain enhancer or related sequences.
Bacterial fusion proteins for Rc bind preferentially to the Rss heptamer and to
the kappa B motif. The dual affinities of Rc for the Rss heptamer and the kappa B
motif suggest a possible link between Ig transcription and somatic recombination.
The formation of multiple 'gel-shifted' DNA-protein complexes for Rc and its DNA 
ligand suggests that these complexes tend to multimerize.
