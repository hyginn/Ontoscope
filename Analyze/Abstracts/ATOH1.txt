Localization of sound sources is a central aspect of auditory processing. A
unique feature of mammals is the smooth, tonotopically organized extension of the
hearing range to high frequencies (HF) above 10kHz, which likely induced positive
selection for novel mechanisms of sound localization. How this change in the
auditory periphery is accompanied by changes in the central auditory system is
unresolved. I will argue that the major VGlut2(+) excitatory projection neurons
of sound localization circuits (dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), lateral and medial
superior olive (LSO and MSO)) represent serial homologs with modifications, thus 
being paramorphs. This assumption is based on common embryonic origin from an
Atoh1(+)/Wnt1(+) cell lineage in the rhombic lip of r5, same cell birth, a
fusiform cell morphology, shared genetic components such as Lhx2 and Lhx9
transcription factors, and similar projection patterns. Such a parsimonious
evolutionary mechanism likely accelerated the emergence of neurons for sound
localization in all three dimensions. Genetic analyses indicate that auditory
nuclei in fish, birds, and mammals receive contributions from the same progenitor
lineages. Anatomical and physiological differences and the independent evolution 
of tympanic ears in vertebrate groups, however, argue for convergent evolution of
sound localization circuits in tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and
mammals). These disparate findings are discussed in the context of the genetic
architecture of the developing hindbrain, which facilitates convergent evolution.
Yet, it will be critical to decipher the gene regulatory networks underlying
development of auditory neurons across vertebrates to explore the possibility of 
homologous neuronal populations.

HMG domain transcription factor, Sox2, is a critical gene for the development of 
cochlear hair cells, the receptor cells for hearing, but this has been ascribed
to expansion of the progenitors that become hair cells. Here, we show that Sox2
activated Atoh1, a transcription factor important for hair cell differentiation, 
through an interaction with the 3' enhancer of Atoh1. Binding to consensus
sequences in the Atoh1 enhancer was dependent on the level of Sox2, and the
extent of enhancer binding correlated to the extent of activation. Atoh1
activation by Sox2 was required for embryonic hair cell development: deletion of 
Sox2 in an inducible mutant, even after progenitor cells were fully established, 
halted development of hair cells, and silencing also inhibited postnatal
differentiation of hair cells induced by inhibition of <U+03B3>-secretase. Sox2 is thus 
required in the cochlea to both expand the progenitor cells and initiate their
differentiation to hair cells.

Determination of cell fate within the prosensory domain of the developing
cochlear duct relies on the temporal and spatial regulation of the bHLH
transcription factor Atoh1. Auditory hair cells and supporting cells arise in a
wave of differentiation that patterns them into discrete rows mediated by
Notch-dependent lateral inhibition. However, the mechanism responsible for
selecting sensory cells from within the prosensory competence domain remains
poorly understood. We show in mice that rather than being upregulated in rows of 
cells, Atoh1 is subject to transcriptional activation in groups of prosensory
cells, and that highly conserved sites for Hes/Hey repressor binding in the Atoh1
promoter are needed to select the hair cell and supporting cell fate. During
perinatal supporting cell transdifferentiation, which is a model of hair cell
regeneration, we show that derepression is sufficient to induce Atoh1 expression,
suggesting a mechanism for priming the 3' Atoh1 autoregulatory enhancer needed
for hair cell expression.

BACKGROUND: Mucosal barrier dysfunction is considered a critical component of
Crohn's disease (CD) pathogenesis after the identification of susceptibility
genes. However, the precise mechanism underlying mucosal barrier dysfunction has 
not yet been elucidated. We therefore aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism 
underlying the expression of human a-defensin 6 (HD6) in patients with CD.
METHODS: HD6 expression was induced by the transfection of an atonal homolog 1
(Atoh1) transgene and was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction. The HD6 promoter region targeted by Atoh1 and ß-catenin was determined 
by reporter analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.
HD5/HD6/Atoh1/ß-catenin expression in noninflamed jejunal samples collected by
balloon endoscopy from 15 patients with CD and 9 non-inflammatory bowel disease
patients were assessed by immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: Both promoter activity and gene expression of HD6 was significantly
upregulated by the Atoh1 transgene in human colonic cancer cell line. We
identified a TCF4 binding site and an E-box site, critical for the regulation of 
HD6 transcriptional activity by directly binding of Atoh1 in the 200-bp HD6
promoter region. The treatment with ß-catenin inhibitor also decreases HD6
promoter activity and gene expression. Moreover, HD6 expression, but not HD5
expression, was found to be decreased in noninflamed jejunal regions from
patients with CD. In HD6-negative crypts, nuclear accumulation of ß-catenin was
impaired.
CONCLUSIONS: HD6 expression was found to be regulated by cooperation between
Atoh1 and ß-catenin within the HD6 promoter region. Downregulation of HD6 in
noninflamed mucosa may contribute to mucosal barrier dysfunction of patients with
CD.

Once inner ear hair cells (HCs) are damaged by drugs, noise or aging, their
apical structures including the stereociliary arrays are frequently the first
cellular feature to be lost. Although this can be followed by progressive loss of
HC somata, a significant number of HC bodies often remain even after
stereociliary loss. However, in the absence of stereocilia they are
nonfunctional. HCs can sometimes be regenerated by Atoh1 transduction or Notch
inhibition, but they also may lack stereociliary bundles. It is therefore
important to develop methods for the regeneration of stereocilia, in order to
achieve HC functional recovery. Espin is an actin-bundling protein known to
participate in sterociliary elongation during development. We evaluated
stereociliary array regeneration in damaged vestibular sensory epithelia in
tissue culture, using viral vector transduction of two espin isoforms. Utricular 
HCs were damaged with aminoglycosides. The utricles were then treated with a
<U+03B3>-secretase inhibitor, followed by espin or control transduction and
histochemistry. Although <U+03B3>-secretase inhibition increased the number of HCs, few 
had stereociliary arrays. In contrast, 46<U+2009>h after espin1 transduction, a
significant increase in hair-bundle-like structures was observed. These were
confirmed to be immature stereociliary arrays by scanning electron microscopy.
Increased uptake of FM1-43 uptake provided evidence of stereociliary function.
Espin4 transduction had no effect. The results demonstrate that espin1 gene
therapy can restore stereocilia on damaged or regenerated HCs.Gene Therapy

Lisboa, Lisboa 1649-028, Portugal.

To gain new insights about the genetic networks controlling hair cell (HC)
development, we previously developed a direct genetic programming strategy to
generate an inexhaustible supply of HC-like cells (induced HCs, iHCs) in vitro,
starting from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC). We found that combined activity
of three transcription factors, Gfi1, Pou4f3, and Atoh1, can program ESC-derived 
progenitors towards HC fate with efficiencies of 55%-80%. These iHCs express
several HC markers and exhibit polarized structures that are highly reminiscent
of the mechanosensitive hair bundles, with many microvilli-like stereocilia.
Here, we describe the experimental design, methodology, and data validation for
the microarray analysis used to characterize the transcriptome profile of iHCs at
different stages of their differentiation. This approach based on FACS sorting
and microarray analysis revealed a highly similar iHC transcriptome to that of
endogenous HCs in vivo. The data obtained in this study is available in the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession number GSE60352).

Hair cells in posthatch chickens regenerate spontaneously through mitosis or the 
transdifferentiation of supporting cells in response to antibiotic injury.
However, how embryonic chicken cochleae respond to antibiotic treatment remains
unknown. This study is the first to indicate that unlike hair cells in posthatch 
chickens, the auditory epithelium was free from antibiotic injury (25-250 mg
gentamicin/kg) in embryonic chickens, although FITC-conjugated gentamicin
actually reached embryonic hair cells. Next, we examined and counted the cells
and performed labeling for BrdU, Sox2, Atoh1/Math1, PV or p27(kip1) (triple or
double labeling) in the injured cochlea ducts after gentamicin treatment at 2 h
(h), 15 h, 24 h, 2 days (d), 3 d and 7 d after BrdU treatment in posthatch
chickens. Our results indicated that following gentamicin administration,
proliferating cells (BrdU+) were labeled for Atoh1/Math1 in the damaged areas 3d 
after gentamicin administration, whereas hair cells (PV+) renewed through mitosis
(BrdU+) or direct transdifferentiation (BrdU-) were evident only after 5 d of
gentamicin administration. In addition, Sox2 expression was up-regulated in
triggered supporting cells at an early stage of regeneration, but stopped at the 
advent of mature hair cells. Our study also indicated that p27(kip1) was
expressed in both hair cells and supporting cells but was down-regulated in a
subgroup of the supporting cells that gave rise to hair cells. These data and the
obtained dynamic changes of the cells labeled for BrdU, Sox2, Atoh1/Math1, PV or 
p27(kip1) are useful for understanding supporting cell behaviors and their fate
specification during hair cell regeneration.

Epithelial regeneration is critical for barrier maintenance and organ function
after intestinal injury. The intestinal stem cell (ISC) niche provides Wnt, Notch
and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signals supporting Lgr5(+) crypt base columnar 
ISCs for normal epithelial maintenance. However, little is known about the
regulation of the ISC compartment after tissue damage. Using ex vivo organoid
cultures, here we show that innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), potent producers of
interleukin-22 (IL-22) after intestinal injury, increase the growth of mouse
small intestine organoids in an IL-22-dependent fashion. Recombinant IL-22
directly targeted ISCs, augmenting the growth of both mouse and human intestinal 
organoids, increasing proliferation and promoting ISC expansion. IL-22 induced
STAT3 phosphorylation in Lgr5(+) ISCs, and STAT3 was crucial for both organoid
formation and IL-22-mediated regeneration. Treatment with IL-22 in vivo after
mouse allogeneic bone marrow transplantation enhanced the recovery of ISCs,
increased epithelial regeneration and reduced intestinal pathology and mortality 
from graft-versus-host disease. ATOH1-deficient organoid culture demonstrated
that IL-22 induced epithelial regeneration independently of the Paneth cell
niche. Our findings reveal a fundamental mechanism by which the immune system is 
able to support the intestinal epithelium, activating ISCs to promote
regeneration.

The mammalian cochlea is a highly specialized organ within the inner ear. Sensory
hair cells (HC) in the cochlea detect and transduce sound waves into electrical
impulses that are sent to the brain. Studies of the molecular pathways regulating
HC formation are hindered by the very sparse nature of HCs, where only ~3300 are 
found within an entire mouse cochlea. Current cell lines mimic certain aspects of
HCs but lack terminal HC marker expression. Here we successfully
"pseudo-immortalized" cochlear progenitor cells using the "conditional
reprogramming" technique. These cells, termed "Conditionally Reprogrammed Otic
Stem Cells" (CR-OSC), are able to bypass the senescence inherent to cochlear
progenitor cells without genetic alterations, allowing for the generation of over
15 million cells from a single cochlea. These cells can be differentiated and
up-regulate both early and terminal differentiation genes associated with HCs,
including the terminal HC differentiation marker prestin. CR-OSCs also respond to
known HC cues, including upregulation of HC genes in response to Atoh1
overexpression, and upregulation of prestin expression after thyroid hormone
application. Overall, we describe the creation of a HC line capable of regulated 
expression of HC genes that can easily be recreated in any laboratory from any
mouse of interest.

CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies have stated the roles and correlation of the four
TFs (Sox2, Atoh1, Neurog1, and Neurod1) in the development of neurosensory cells.
but whether they are inherited pathogenic factors to cause non-syndromic
sensorineural hearing loss is unknown so far. This is the first time for
screening the Sox2, Atoh1, Neurog1, and Neurod1 genes in children with NSHL. The 
c.133A<U+2009>><U+2009>G in Neurod1 gene is a polymorphism, which is not associated with NSHL. 
Although these genes are the recognized TFs for modulating the development and
transformation of NSCs, they may not be the inherited pathogenic factors to cause
congenital severe or profound NSHL directly.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of the transcription factors (TFs) for the
development of neurosensory cells (NSCs) and to explore the genetic etiology of
congenital profound non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss (NSHL).
METHODS: Children with NSHL, from multi-national and regional group, and control 
group were recruited to screen for the most common mutations for non-syndromic
deafness among East Asian (mtDNA 12S rRNA: 1555A<U+2009>><U+2009>G, 1494C<U+2009>><U+2009>T; SLC26A4: IVS7-2 
A<U+2009>><U+2009>G, 2168 C<U+2009>><U+2009>T). And mutational analysis of the coding regions in Sox2, Atoh1 
and Neurog1, Neurod1 genes were performed.
RESULTS: Only the c.133A<U+2009>><U+2009>G (p. Ala45Thr) in the Neurod1 gene was detected in
this study. The allele frequencies of this variant were 88.00% and 84.88% in the 
inner ear malformation group and the normal inner ear group, respectively, while 
90.85% of children in the control group carried c.133A<U+2009>><U+2009>G. This variant existed 
in every group commonly and had no significant difference among them. No variant 
in the other two TFs was detected in this cohort.

Crosstalk between the Notch signaling pathway and Caudal-related homeobox 2
(Cdx2) has important roles in the development of Barrett's esophagus (BE). We
investigated the expression and function of the Notch signaling ligand Delta-like
1 (Dll1) during the development of BE. We determined the expression levels of
Dll1 and intracellular signaling molecules related to Notch signaling ((Notch1,
Hairy/enhancer of split 1 (Hes1), and Atonal homolog 1 (ATOH1)) in human
esophageal squamous and Barrett's epithelium samples. Next, those expression
levels in esophageal squamous cells (Het-1A) and Barrett's esophageal cells (CP-A
and BAR-T) following stimulation with either bile acids or gamma-secretase
inhibitor were investigated. Finally, changes in those expression levels
following transfection of a Cdx2 or Dll1 expression vector into Het-1A cells were
examined. In addition, changes in those expression levels following knockdown of 
Cdx2 or Dll1 in CP-A cells were also examined. Dll1 was found to be upregulated
and localized in the cell membrane and cytoplasm in BE. Bile acids enhanced
cytoplasmic expression of Dll1 in CP-A cells, while cleaved Notch1 expression did
not change, suggesting lack of a Dll1 agonistic effect on Notch signaling. Cells 
transfected with Cdx2 revealed significantly enhanced Dll1, while forced
expression of Dll1 enhanced ATOH1, Cdx2, and MUC2 expression levels.
Nevertheless, enhanced Dll1 did not induce Hes1 expression, suggesting that Dll1 
may primarily function as an intracellular signaling molecule and not a Notch
agonistic ligand in the canonical pathway. In addition, knockdown of Cdx2
completely abrogated any increase in Dll1 expression upon treatment with bile
acids. Our results revealed a novel function of Dll1: facilitation of intestinal 
metaplasia in conjunction with Cdx2 expression. Furthermore, they suggest that
intracellular induction of Dll1 expression in esophageal epithelial cells due to 
Cdx2 induction in response to bile acids has important roles in BE development.

OTX proteins, homologs of the Drosophila orthodenticle (Otd), are important for
the morphogenesis of the neuroectoderm, and for the central nervous system
formation. OTX1 and OTX2 are important for the cochlea and macula development,
indeed when OTX1 is knocked down, these organs undergo developmental failure.
Moreover OTX2 transfection revert this effect in OTX1(-/-) mice. The TA isoform
of TP63, involved in Notch regulation pathway, has a critical function in the
cochlear neuroepithelium differentiation. TAp63 positively regulates Hes5 and
Atoh1 transcription. This pathway has been also demonstrated in p63(-/-) mice,
and in patients p63 mutated, affected by Ectodermal Dysplasia (ED, OMIM 129810). 
These patients are affected by mild sensorineural deafness, most likely related
to the mutation in p63 gene impairing the Notch pathway. We demonstrated the role
of OTX2 on TAp63 regulation necessary for the correct formation of macular
neuroepithelium and we confirmed the impairment of vestibular function caused by 
p63 mutations. Although the abnormalities found in our patient were still at a
subclinical extent, aging could exacerbate this impairment and cause a decrease
in quality of life.

The Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1) gene plays crucial roles in cell differentiation,
proliferation and the establishment of cell polarity. We created LKB1 conditional
knockout mice (LKB1(Atoh1) CKO) to investigate the function of LKB1 in cerebellar
development. The LKB1(Atoh1) CKO mice displayed motor dysfunction. In the
LKB1(Atoh1) CKO cerebellum, the overall structure had a larger volume and more
lobules. LKB1 inactivation led to an increased proliferation of granule cell
precursors (GCPs), aberrant granule cell migration and overproduction of unipolar
brush cells. To investigate the mechanism underlying the abnormal foliation, we
examined sonic hedgehog signalling (Shh) by testing its transcriptional
mediators, the Gli proteins, which regulate the GCPs proliferation and cerebellar
foliation during cerebellar development. The expression levels of Gli genes were 
significantly increased in the mutant cerebellum. In vitro assays showed that the
proliferation of cultured GCPs from mutant cerebellum significantly increased,
whereas the proliferation of mutant GCPs significantly decreased in the presence 
of a Shh inhibitor GDC-0049. Thus, LKB1 deficiency in the LKB1(Atoh1) CKO mice
enhanced Shh signalling, leading to the excessive GCP proliferation and the
formation of extra lobules. We proposed that LKB1 regulates cerebellar
development by controlling GCPs proliferation through Shh signalling during
cerebellar development.

Proprioception, the sense of limb and body position, is essential for generating 
proper movement. Unconscious proprioceptive information travels through
cerebellar-projecting neurons in the spinal cord and medulla. The progenitor
domain defined by the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, ATOH1, 
has been implicated in forming these cerebellar-projecting neurons; however,
their precise contribution to proprioceptive tracts and motor behavior is
unknown. Significantly, we demonstrate that Atoh1-lineage neurons in the spinal
cord reside outside Clarke's column (CC), a main contributor of neurons relaying 
hindlimb proprioception, despite giving rise to the anatomical and functional
correlate of CC in the medulla, the external cuneate nucleus (ECu), which
mediates forelimb proprioception. Elimination of caudal Atoh1-lineages results in
mice with relatively normal locomotion but unable to perform coordinated motor
tasks. Altogether, we reveal that proprioceptive nuclei in the spinal cord and
medulla develop from more than one progenitor source, suggesting an avenue to
uncover distinct proprioceptive functions.

Mammalian sleep comprises rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM)
sleep. To functionally isolate from the complex mixture of neurons populating the
brainstem pons those involved in switching between REM and NREM sleep, we
chemogenetically manipulated neurons of a specific embryonic cell lineage in
mice. We identified excitatory glutamatergic neurons that inhibit REM sleep and
promote NREM sleep. These neurons shared a common developmental origin with
neurons promoting wakefulness; both derived from a pool of proneural hindbrain
cells expressing Atoh1 at embryonic day 10.5. We also identified inhibitory
<U+03B3>-aminobutyric acid-releasing neurons that act downstream to inhibit REM sleep.
Artificial reduction or prolongation of REM sleep in turn affected slow-wave
activity during subsequent NREM sleep, implicating REM sleep in the regulation of
NREM sleep.

In the developing cochlea, sensory hair cell differentiation depends on the
regulated expression of the bHLH transcription factor Atoh1. In mammals, if hair 
cells die they do not regenerate, leading to permanent deafness. By contrast, in 
non-mammalian vertebrates robust regeneration occurs through upregulation of
Atoh1 in the surviving supporting cells that surround hair cells, leading to
functional recovery. Investigation of crucial transcriptional events in the
developing organ of Corti, including those involving Atoh1, has been hampered by 
limited accessibility to purified populations of the small number of cells
present in the inner ear. We used µChIP and qPCR assays of FACS-purified cells to
track changes in the epigenetic status of the Atoh1 locus during sensory
epithelia development in the mouse. Dynamic changes in the histone modifications 
H3K4me3/H3K27me3, H3K9ac and H3K9me3 reveal a progression from poised, to active,
to repressive marks, correlating with the onset of Atoh1 expression and its
subsequent silencing during the perinatal (P1 to P6) period. Inhibition of
acetylation blocked the increase in Atoh1 mRNA in nascent hair cells, as well as 
ongoing hair cell differentiation during embryonic organ of Corti development ex 
vivo. These results reveal an epigenetic mechanism of Atoh1 regulation underlying
hair cell differentiation and subsequent maturation. Interestingly, the
H3K4me3/H3K27me3 bivalent chromatin structure observed in progenitors persists at
the Atoh1 locus in perinatal supporting cells, suggesting an explanation for the 
latent capacity of these cells to transdifferentiate into hair cells, and
highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets in hair cell regeneration.

Target recognition by developing axons is one of the fundamental steps for
establishing the proper pattern of neuronal connectivity during development.
However, knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie this critical event is still
limited. In this study, to examine how commissural axons in vertebrates recognize
their targets after crossing the midline, we analyzed in detail the behavior of
postcrossing commissural axons derived from the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) in
the developing mouse cerebellum. For this, we employed a cell-type-specific
genetic labeling approach to selectively visualize DCN axons during the time when
these axons project to the red nucleus (RN), one of the well-characterized
targets of DCN axons. We found that, when DCN axons initially entered the RN at
its caudal end, these axons continued to grow rostrally through the RN without
showing noticeable morphological signs of axon branching. Interestingly, after a 
delay, DCN axons started forming interstitial branches from the portion of the
axon shaft selectively within the RN. Because commissural axons acquire
responsiveness to several guidance cues when they cross the midline, we further
addressed whether midline crossing is a prerequisite for subsequent targeting by 
using a Robo3 knockdown strategy. We found that DCN axons were still capable of
forming interstitial branches within the RN even in the absence of midline
crossing. These results therefore suggest that the mechanism of RN recognition by
DCN axons involves a delayed interstitial branching, and that these axons possess
an intrinsic ability to respond to the target-derived cues irrespective of
midline crossing. J. Comp. Neurol. 524:999-1014, 2016. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals,

Auditory hair cells have repeatedly been shown to be susceptible to ototoxicity
from a multitude of drugs including aminoglycoside antibiotics. Here, we found
that systemic HDAC inhibition using suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) on
adult mice offers almost complete protection against hair cell loss and hearing
threshold shifts from acute ototoxic insult from kanamycin potentiated with
furosemide. We also found that the apparent lack of hair cell loss was completely
independent of spontaneous or facilitated (ectopic Atoh1 induction) hair cell
regeneration. Rather, SAHA treatment correlated with RelA acetylation (K310) and 
subsequent activation of the Nf-<U+03BA>B pro-survival pathway leading to expression of 
pro-survival genes such as Cflar (cFLIP) and Bcl2l1 (Bcl-xL). In addition, we
also detected increased expression of pro-survival genes Cdkn1a (p21) and Hspa1a 
(Hsp70), and decreased expression of the pro-apoptosis gene Bcl2l11 (Bim). These 
data combined provide evidence that class I HDACs control the transcriptional
activation of pro-survival pathways in response to ototoxic insult by regulating 
the acetylation status of transcription factors found at the crossroads of cell
death and survival in the mammalian inner ear.

The LKB1 gene, which encodes a serine/threonine kinase, was discovered to play
crucial roles in cell differentiation, proliferation, and the establishment of
cell polarity. In our study, LKB1 conditional knockout mice (Atoh1-LKB1-/- mice) 
were generated to investigate LKB1 function in the inner ear. Tests of auditory
brainstem response and distortion product otoacoustic emissions revealed
significant decreases in the hearing sensitivities of the Atoh1-LKB1-/- mice. In 
Atoh1-LKB1-/- mice, malformations of hair cell stereocilliary bundles were
present as early as postnatal day 1 (P1), a time long before the maturation of
the hair cell bundles. In addition, we also observed outer hair cell (OHC) loss
starting at P14. The impaired stereocilliary bundles occurred long before the
presence of hair cell loss. Stereociliary cytoskeletal structure depends on the
core actin-based cytoskeleton and several actin-binding proteins. By Western
blot, we examined actin-binding proteins, specifically ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin)
proteins involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton of hair cell
stereocilia. Our results revealed that the phosphorylation of ERM proteins (pERM)
was significantly decreased in mutant mice. Thus, we propose that the decreased
pERM may be a key factor for the impaired stereocillia function, and the damaged 
stereocillia may induce hair cell loss and hearing impairments. Taken together,
our data indicates that LKB1 is required for the development and maintenance of
stereocilia in the inner ear.

The mammalian cochlea exhibit minimal spontaneous regeneration, and loss of
sensory hair cells (HCs) results in permanent hearing loss. In nonmammalian
vertebrates, spontaneous HC regeneration occurs through both proliferation and
differentiation of surrounding supporting cells (SCs). HC regeneration in
postnatal mammalian cochleae in vivo remains limited by the small HC number and
subsequent death of regenerated HCs. Here, we describe in vivo generation of
10-fold more new HCs in the mouse cochlea than previously reported, most of which
survive to adulthood. We achieved this by combining the expression of a
constitutively active form of ß-catenin (a canonical Wnt activator) with ectopic 
expression of Atoh1 (a HC fate determination factor) in neonatal Lgr5+ cells (the
presumed SC and HC progenitors of the postnatal mouse cochlea), and discovered
synergistic increases in proliferation and differentiation. The new HCs were
predominantly located near the endogenous inner HCs, expressed early HC
differentiation markers, and were innervated despite incomplete alignment of
presynaptic and postsynaptic markers. Surprisingly, genetic tracing revealed that
only a subset of Lgr5+ cells that lie medial to the inner HCs respond to this
combination, highlighting a previously unknown heterogeneity that exists among
Lgr5+ cells. Together, our data indicate that ß-catenin and Atoh1 mediate
synergistic effects on both proliferation and differentiation of a subset of
neonatal cochlear Lgr5+ cells, thus overcoming major limitations of HC
regeneration in postnatal mouse cochleae in vivo. These results provide a basis
for combinatorial therapeutics for hearing restoration.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT:
Hearing loss in humans from aging, noise exposure, or ototoxic drugs (i.e.,
cisplatin or some antibiotics) is permanent and affects every segments of the
population, worldwide. However, birds, frog, and fish have the ability to recover
hearing, and recent studies have focused on understanding and applying what we
have learned from them for restoring hearing in humans. However, studies have
been hampered by low efficiency, limited cell numbers, and subsequent death of
these newly generated auditory cells. Here, we describe a combinatorial approach,
which results in the generation of auditory cells in greater numbers than
previously reported, with most of them surviving to adult ages in vivo. These
results provide a basis for combinatorial therapeutics for hearing restoration
efforts.

Atoh1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor (TF), is essential
for the differentiation of hair cells (HCs), mechanotransducers that convert
sound into auditory signals in the mammalian organ of Corti (OC). Previous work
demonstrated that replacing mouse Atoh1 with the fly ortholog atonal rescues HC
differentiation, indicating functional replacement by other bHLH genes. However, 
replacing Atoh1 with Neurog1 resulted in reduced HC differentiation compared with
transient Atoh1 expression in a 'self-terminating' Atoh1 conditional null mouse
(Atoh1-Cre; Atoh1(f/f)). We now show that combining Neurog1 in one allele with
removal of floxed Atoh1 in a self-terminating conditional mutant (Atoh1-Cre;
Atoh1(f/kiNeurog1)) mouse results in significantly more differentiated inner HCs 
and outer HCs that have a prolonged longevity of 9 months compared with Atoh1
self-terminating littermates. Stereocilia bundles are partially disorganized,
disoriented and not HC type specific. Replacement of Atoh1 with Neurog1 maintains
limited expression of Pou4f3 and Barhl1 and rescues HCs quantitatively, but not
qualitatively. OC patterning and supporting cell differentiation are also
partially disrupted. Diffusible factors involved in patterning are reduced (Fgf8)
and factors involved in cell-cell interactions are affected (Jag1, Hes5). Despite
the presence of many HCs with stereocilia these mice are deaf, possibly owing to 
HC and OC patterning defects. This study provides a novel approach to disrupt OC 
development through modulating the HC-specific intracellular TF network. The
resulting disorganized OC indicates that normally differentiated HCs act as
'self-organizers' for OC development and that Atoh1 plays a crucial role to
initiate HC stereocilia differentiation independently of HC viability.

Neurosensory hearing loss is a growing problem of super-aged societies. Cochlear 
implants can restore some hearing, but rebuilding a lost hearing organ would be
superior. Research has discovered many cellular and molecular steps to develop a 
hearing organ but translating those insights into hearing organ restoration
remains unclear. For example, we cannot make various hair cell types and arrange 
them into their specific patterns surrounded by the right type of supporting
cells in the right numbers. Our overview of the topologically highly organized
and functionally diversified cellular mosaic of the mammalian hearing organ
highlights what is known and unknown about its development. Following this
analysis, we suggest critical steps to guide future attempts toward restoration
of a functional organ of Corti. We argue that generating mutant mouse lines that 
mimic human pathology to fine-tune attempts toward long-term functional
restoration are needed to go beyond the hope generated by restoring single hair
cells in postnatal sensory epithelia.

Merkel cells are mechanosensitive skin cells whose production requires the basic 
helix-loop-helix transcription factor Atoh1. We induced ectopic Atoh1 expression 
in the skin of transgenic mice to determine whether Atoh1 was sufficient to
create additional Merkel cells. In embryos, ectopic Atoh1 expression drove
ectopic expression of the Merkel cell marker keratin 8 (K8) throughout the
epidermis. Epidermal Atoh1 induction in adolescent mice similarly drove
widespread K8 expression in glabrous skin of the paws, but in the whisker pads
and body skin ectopic K8+ cells were confined to hair follicles and absent from
interfollicular regions. Ectopic K8+ cells acquired several characteristics of
mature Merkel cells in a time frame similar to that seen during postnatal
development of normal Merkel cells. Although ectopic K8+ cell numbers decreased
over time, small numbers of these cells remained in deep regions of body skin
hair follicles at 3 months post-induction. In adult mice, greater numbers of
ectopic K8+ cells were created by Atoh1 induction during anagen versus telogen
and following disruption of Notch signaling by conditional deletion of Rbpj in
the epidermis. Our data demonstrate that Atoh1 expression is sufficient to
produce new Merkel cells in the epidermis, that epidermal cell competency to
respond to Atoh1 varies by skin location, developmental age and hair cycle stage,
and that the Notch pathway plays a key role in limiting epidermal cell competency
to respond to Atoh1 expression.

Rnf43 (RING finger protein 43) and Znrf3 (zinc/RING finger protein 3) (RZ) are
two closely related transmembrane E3 ligases, encoded by Wnt target genes, that
remove surface Wnt (wingless-int) receptors. The two genes are mutated in various
human cancers. Such tumors are predicted to be hypersensitive to, yet still
depend on, secreted Wnts. We previously showed that mutation of RZ in the
intestine yields rapidly growing adenomas containing LGR5(+) (leucine-rich
repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5) stem cells and Wnt3-producing
Paneth cells. We now show that removal of Paneth cells by Math1 mutation inhibits
RZ(-/-) tumor formation. Similarly, deletion of Wnt3 inhibits tumorigenesis.
Treatment of mice carrying RZ(-/-) intestinal neoplasia with a small molecule Wnt
secretion inhibitor (porcupine inhibitor C59) strongly inhibited growth, whereas 
adjacent normal crypts remained intact. These results establish that paracrine
Wnt secretion is an essential driver of RZ(-/-) tumor growth and imply that a
therapeutic window exists for the use of porcupine inhibitors for RZ-mutant
cancers.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of
developing colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). CAC cells often develop
chemoresistance, resulting in a poorer prognosis than that of sporadic colorectal
cancer (CRC). The mechanism by which CAC enhances malignant potential remains
unknown. We have previously reported that the proteasomal degradation of the
transcription factor Atonal homolog 1 (Atoh1) protein results in the non-mucinous
form of CRC. It also remains unknown whether Atoh1 protein is expressed in CAC.
Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether Atoh1 protein stabilizes
in CAC. Consequently, the treatment with TNF-a stabilized Atoh1 protein through
the inactivation of GSK-3ß via Akt, resulting in the mucinous form of CRC cell
lines. Atoh1 protein also enriched cancer stem cells with upregulated Lgr5
expression and cells in G0/G1 cell cycle phase, resulting in both the
chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin and the promotion of cell
migration. Immunofluorescence of the human mucinous CAC specimens showed the
accumulation of NF-<U+03BA>B p65 at nuclei with the expression of Atoh1 in mucinous
cancer. In conclusion, the inflammation associated with carcinogenesis may
preserve the differentiation system of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC),
resulting in the acquisition of both the mucinous phenotype and high malignant
potential associated with the enrichment of cancer stem cell.

Mechanosensory hair cells (HCs) are the primary receptors of our senses of
hearing and balance. Elucidation of the transcriptional networks regulating HC
fate determination and differentiation is crucial not only to understand inner
ear development but also to improve cell replacement therapies for hearing
disorders. Here, we show that combined expression of the transcription factors
Gfi1, Pou4f3 and Atoh1 can induce direct programming towards HC fate, both during
in vitro mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation and following ectopic
expression in chick embryonic otic epithelium. Induced HCs (iHCs) express
numerous HC-specific markers and exhibit polarized membrane protrusions
reminiscent of stereociliary bundles. Transcriptome profiling confirms the
progressive establishment of a HC-specific gene signature during in vitro iHC
programming. Overall, this work provides a novel approach to achieve robust and
highly efficient HC production in vitro, which could be used as a model to study 
HC development and to drive inner ear HC regeneration.

Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling regulates cochlear extension and coordinates
orientation of sensory hair cells in the inner ear. Retroviral-mediated
introduction of the Math1 transcription factor leads to the transdifferentiation 
of some mature supporting cells into hair cells. Testosterone, a gonadal sex
steroid hormone, is associated with neuroprotection and regeneration in Central
Nervous System (CNS) development. Experiments were performed in vitro using
Ad5-EGFP-Math1/Ad5-Math1 in neonatal mouse cochleas. Establishment of ectopic
hair-cell like cell(HCLC) polarity in the lesser epithelial ridge (LER) with or
without testosterone-3-(O-carboxymethyl) oxime bovine serum albumin
(testosterone-BSA) treatment was investigated to determine the role of the PCP
pathway in regulating ectopic regenerated (HCLCs) through induction by Math1 and 
testosterone treatment. After Math1 infection, new ectopic regenerated HCLCs were
detected in the LER. After the HCLCs developed actin-rich stereocilia, the basal 
bodies moved from the center to the distal side. Moreover, the narrower,
non-sensory LER region meant that the convergent extension (CE) was also
established after transfection with Math1. After 9 days of in vitro
testosterone-BSA treatment, more Edu(+), Sox2(+), and HCLC cells were observed in
the LER with an accompanying downregulation of E-cadherin. Interestingly, the CE 
of the Ad5-EGFP-math1 treated LER is altered, but the intrinsic cellular polarity
of the HCLCs is not obviously changed. In summary, our results indicate that PCP 
signaling is involved in the development of ectopic HCLCs and the CE of the
ectopic sensory region is altered by testosterone-BSA through downregulation of
cell-cell adhesion. Testosterone-BSA and Math1 treatment could promote an
increase in HCLCs in the LER through proliferation and transdifferentiation.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been shown to mediate tumorigenicity,
chemo-resistance, radio-resistance and metastasis, which suggest they be
considered therapeutic targets. Because their differentiated daughter cells are
no longer tumorigenic, to induce the differentiation of CSCs can be one of
strategies which can eradicate CSCs. Here we show that ATOH1 can induce the
differentiation of gastric cancer stem cells (GCSCs). Real time PCR and western
blot analysis showed that ATOH1 was induced during the differentiation of GCSCs. 
Furthermore, the lentivirus-induced overexpression of ATOH1 in GCSCs and in
gastric cancer cell lines significantly induced differentiation, reduced
proliferation and sphere formation, and reduced in vivo tumor formation in the
subcutaneous injection and liver metastasis xenograft models. These results
suggest ATOH1 be considered for the development of a differentiation therapy for 
gastric cancer.

Sensory hair cells are mechanoreceptors of the auditory and vestibular systems
and are crucial for hearing and balance. In adult mammals, auditory hair cells
are unable to regenerate, and damage to these cells results in permanent hearing 
loss. By contrast, hair cells in the chick cochlea and the zebrafish lateral line
are able to regenerate, prompting studies into the signaling pathways, morphogen 
gradients and transcription factors that regulate hair cell development and
regeneration in various species. Here, we review these findings and discuss how
various signaling pathways and factors function to modulate sensory hair cell
development and regeneration. By comparing and contrasting development and
regeneration, we also highlight the utility and limitations of using defined
developmental cues to drive mammalian hair cell regeneration.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of cerebellar function and
homeostasis. Their deregulation results in cerebellar neuronal degeneration and
spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 and contributes to medulloblastoma. Canonical miRNA
processing involves Dicer, which cleaves precursor miRNAs into mature
double-stranded RNA duplexes. In order to address the role of miRNAs in
cerebellar granule cell precursor development, loxP-flanked exons of Dicer1 were 
conditionally inactivated using the granule cell precursor-specific Atoh1-Cre
recombinase. A reduction of 87% in Dicer1 transcript was achieved in this
conditional Dicer knockdown model. Although knockdown resulted in normal
survival, mice had disruptions to the cortical layering of the anterior
cerebellum, which resulted from the premature differentiation of granule cell
precursors in this region during neonatal development. This defect manifested as 
a thinner external granular layer with ectopic mature granule cells, and a
depleted internal granular layer. We found that expression of the activator
components of the Hedgehog-Patched pathway, the Gli family of transcription
factors, was perturbed in conditional Dicer knockdown mice. We propose that loss 
of Gli2 mRNA mediated the anterior-restricted defect in conditional Dicer
knockdown mice and, as proof of principle, were able to show that miR-106b
positively regulated Gli2 mRNA expression. These findings confirm the importance 
of miRNAs as positive mediators of Hedgehog-Patched signalling during granule
cell precursor development.

BACKGROUND: Medulloblastomas are malignant childhood brain tumors that arise due 
to the aberrant activity of developmental pathways during postnatal cerebellar
development and in adult humans. Transcriptome analysis has identified four major
medulloblastoma subgroups. One of them, the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) subgroup, is
caused by aberrant Hedgehog signal transduction due to mutations in the Patched1 
(PTCH1) receptor or downstream effectors. Mice carrying a Patched-1 null allele
(Ptch1<U+2206>/+) are a good model to study the alterations underlying medulloblastoma
development as a consequence of aberrant Hedgehog pathway activity.
RESULTS: Transcriptome analysis of human medulloblastomas shows that SERPINE2,
also called Protease Nexin-1 (PN-1) is overexpressed in most medulloblastomas, in
particular in the SHH and WNT subgroups. As siRNA-mediated lowering of
SERPINE2/PN-1 in human medulloblastoma DAOY cells reduces cell proliferation, we 
analyzed its potential involvement in medulloblastoma development using the
Ptch1<U+2206>/+ mouse model. In Ptch1<U+2206>/+ mice, medulloblastomas arise as a consequence
of aberrant Hedgehog pathway activity. Genetic reduction of Serpine2/Pn-1
interferes with medulloblastoma development in Ptch1<U+2206>/+ mice, as ~60% of the
pre-neoplastic lesions (PNLs) fail to develop into medulloblastomas and remain as
small cerebellar nodules. In particular the transcription factor Atoh1, whose
expression is essential for development of SHH subgroup medulloblastomas is lost.
Comparative molecular analysis reveals the distinct nature of the PNLs in young
Ptch1<U+2206>/+Pn-1<U+0394>/+ mice. The remaining wild-type Ptch1 allele escapes
transcriptional silencing in most cases and the aberrant Hedgehog pathway
activity is normalized. Furthermore, cell proliferation and the expression of the
cell-cycle regulators Mycn and Cdk6 are significantly reduced in PNLs of
Ptch1<U+2206>/+Pn-1<U+0394>/+ mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis provides genetic evidence that aberrant Serpine2/Pn-1
is required for proliferation of human and mouse medulloblastoma cells. In
summary, our analysis shows that Serpine2/PN-1 boosts malignant progression of
PNLs to medulloblastomas, in which the Hedgehog pathway is activated in a SHH
ligand-independent manner.

Maintaining constant CO2 and H(+) concentrations in the arterial blood is
critical for life. The principal mechanism through which this is achieved in
mammals is the respiratory chemoreflex whose circuitry is still elusive. A
candidate element of this circuitry is the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a
collection of neurons at the ventral medullary surface that are activated by
increased CO2 or low pH and project to the respiratory rhythm generator. Here, we
use intersectional genetic strategies to lesion the RTN neurons defined by Atoh1 
and Phox2b expression and to block or activate their synaptic output.
Photostimulation of these neurons entrains the respiratory rhythm. Conversely,
abrogating expression of Atoh1 or Phox2b or glutamatergic transmission in these
cells curtails the phrenic nerve response to low pH in embryonic preparations and
abolishes the respiratory chemoreflex in behaving animals. Thus, the RTN neurons 
expressing Atoh1 and Phox2b are a necessary component of the chemoreflex
circuitry.

Hair cells are sensory receptors for the auditory and vestibular system in
vertebrates. The transcription factor Atoh1 is both necessary and sufficient for 
the differentiation of hair cells, and is strongly upregulated during hair-cell
regeneration in nonmammalian vertebrates. To identify genes involved in hair cell
development and function, we performed RNA-seq profiling of purified
Atoh1-expressing hair cells from the neonatal mouse cochlea. We identified >600
enriched transcripts in cochlear hair cells, of which 90% have not been
previously shown to be expressed in hair cells. We identified 233 of these hair
cell genes as candidates to be directly regulated by Atoh1 based on the presence 
of Atoh1 binding sites in their regulatory regions and by analyzing Atoh1
ChIP-seq datasets from the cerebellum and small intestine. We confirmed 10 of
these genes as being direct Atoh1 targets in the cochlea by ChIP-PCR. The
identification of candidate Atoh1 target genes is a first step in identifying
gene regulatory networks for hair-cell development and may inform future studies 
on the potential role of Atoh1 in mammalian hair cell regeneration.

The transcription factor atonal homolog 1 (ATOH1) has multiple homologues that
are functionally conserved across species and is responsible for the generation
of sensory hair cells. To evaluate potential functional differences between
homologues, human and mouse ATOH1 (HATH1 and MATH-1, respectively) were
nonvirally delivered to human Wharton's jelly cells (hWJCs) for the first time.
Delivery of HATH1 to hWJCs demonstrated superior expression of inner ear hair
cell markers and characteristics than delivery of MATH-1. Inhibition of HES1 and 
HES5 signaling further increased the atonal effect. Transfection of hWJCs with
HATH1 DNA, HES1 siRNA, and HES5 siRNA displayed positive identification of key
hair cell and support cell markers found in the cochlea, as well as a variety of 
cell shapes, sizes, and features not native to hair cells, suggesting the need
for further examination of other cell types induced by HATH1 expression. In the
first side-by-side evaluation of HATH1 and MATH-1 in human cells, substantial
differences were observed, suggesting that the two atonal homologues may not be
interchangeable in human cells, and artificial expression of HATH1 in hWJCs
requires further study. In the future, this line of research may lead to
engineered systems that would allow for evaluation of drug ototoxicity or
potentially even direct therapeutic use.

Opportunities and limits of the one gene approach: the ability of Atoh1 to
differentiate and maintain hair cells depends on the molecular context.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, University of Iowa Iowa City, IA, USA.

Atoh1 (Math1) was the first gene discovered in ear development that showed no
hair cell (HC) differentiation when absent and could induce HC differentiation
when misexpressed. These data implied that Atoh1 was both necessary and
sufficient for hair cell development. However, other gene mutations also result
in loss of initially forming HCs, notably null mutants for Pou4f3, Barhl1, and
Gfi1. HC development and maintenance also depend on the expression of other genes
(Sox2, Eya1, Gata3, Pax2) and several genes have been identified that can induce 
HCs when misexpressed (Jag1) or knocked out (Lmo4). In the ear Atoh1 is not only 
expressed in HCs but also in some supporting cells and neurons that do not
differentiate into HCs. Simple removal of one gene, Neurod1, can de-repress Atoh1
and turns those neurons into HCs suggesting that Neurod1 blocks Atoh1 function in
neurons. Atoh1 expression in inner pillar cells may also be blocked by too many
Hes/Hey factors but conversion into HCs has only partially been achieved through 
Hes/Hey removal. Detailed analysis of cell cycle exit confirmed an apex to base
cell cycle exit progression of HCs of the organ of Corti. In contrast, Atoh1
expression progresses from the base toward the apex with a variable delay
relative to the cell cycle exit. Most HCs exit the cell cycle and are thus
defined as precursors before Atoh1 is expressed. Atoh1 is a potent
differentiation factor but can differentiate and maintain HCs only in the ear and
when other factors are co-expressed. Upstream factors are essential to regulate
Atoh1 level of expression duration while downstream, co-activated by other
factors, will define the context of Atoh1 action. We suggest that these insights 
need to be taken into consideration and approaches beyond the simple Atoh1
expression need to be designed able to generate the radial and longitudinal
variations in hair cell types for normal function of the organ of Corti.

Loss of vestibular hair cells is a common cause of balance disorders. Current
treatment options for bilateral vestibular dysfunction are limited. During
development, atonal homolog 1 (Atoh1) is sufficient and necessary for the
formation of hair cells and provides a promising gene target to induce hair cell 
generation in the mammals. In this study, we used a transgenic mouse line to test
the age and cell type specificity of hair cell induction in the postnatal utricle
in mice. We found that forced Atoh1 expression in vivo can induce hair cell
formation in the utricle from postnatal days 1 to 21, while the efficacy of hair 
cell induction is progressively reduced as the animals become older. In the
utricle, the induction of hair cells occurs both within the sensory region and in
cells in the transitional epithelium next to the sensory region. Within the
sensory epithelium, the central region, known as the striola, is most subjective 
to the induction of hair cell formation. Furthermore, forced Atoh1 expression can
promote proliferation in an age-dependent manner that mirrors the progressively
reduced efficacy of hair cell induction in the postnatal utricle. These results
suggest that targeting both cell proliferation and Atoh1 in the utricle striolar 
region may be explored to induce hair cell regeneration in mammals. The study
also demonstrates the usefulness of the animal model that provides an in vivo

INTRODUCTION: The sensory epithelium of the cochlea is a complex structure
containing hair cells, supporting cells and auditory nerve endings, all of which 
degenerate after hearing loss in mammals. Biological approaches are being
considered to preserve and restore the sensory epithelium after hearing loss. Of 
particular note is the ectopic expression of the Atoh1 gene, which has been shown
to convert residual supporting cells into hair cells with restoration of function
in some cases.
AREAS COVERED: In this review, hair cell development, spontaneous regeneration
and hair cell regeneration mediated by Atoh1 gene therapy in the cochlea are
discussed.
EXPERT OPINION: Gene therapy can be safely delivered locally to the inner ear and
can be targeted to the sensory epithelium of the cochlea. Expression of the Atoh1
gene in supporting cells results in their transformation into cells with the
appearance and function of immature hair cells but with the resulting loss of the
original supporting cell. While the feasibility of Atoh1 gene therapy in the
cochlea is largely dependent on the severity of the hearing loss, hearing
restoration can be achieved in some situations. With further advances in Atoh1
gene therapy, hearing loss may not be as permanent as once thought.

Resident progenitor cells in mammalian skin generate new cells as a part of
tissue homeostasis. We sought to identify the progenitors of Merkel cells, a
unique skin cell type that plays critical roles in mechanosensation. We found
that some Atoh1-expressing cells in the hairy skin and whisker follicles are
mitotically active at embryonic and postnatal ages. Genetic fate-mapping revealed
that these Atoh1-expressing cells give rise solely to Merkel cells. Furthermore, 
selective ablation of Atoh1(+) skin cells in adult mice led to a permanent
reduction in Merkel cell numbers, demonstrating that other stem cell populations 
are incapable of producing Merkel cells. These data identify a novel, unipotent
progenitor population in the skin that gives rise to Merkel cells both during
development and adulthood.

No genes have been discovered for which expression is limited only to inner ear
hair cells. This is hardly surprising, since the number of mammalian genes is
estimated to be 20-25,000, and each gene typically performs many tasks in various
locations. Many genes are expressed in inner ear sensory cells and not in other
cells of the labyrinth. However, these genes are also expressed in other
locations, often in other sensory or neuronal cell types. How gene transcription 
is directed specifically to hair cells is unclear. Key transcription factors that
act during development can specify cell phenotypes, and the hair cell is no
exception. The transcription factor ATOH1 is well known for its ability to
transform nonsensory cells of the developing inner ear into hair cells. And yet, 
ATOH1 also specifies different sensory cells at other locations, neuronal
phenotypes in the brain, and epithelial cells in the gut. How it specifies hair
cells in the inner ear, but alternate cell types in other locations, is not
known. Studies of regulatory DNA and transcription factors are revealing
mechanisms that direct gene expression to hair cells, and that determine the hair
cell identity. The purpose of this review is to summarize what is known about
such gene regulation in this key auditory and vestibular cell type.

OBJECTIVE: Transplanting exogenous neuronal progenitors to replace damaged
neurons in the adult brain following injury or neurodegenerative disorders and
achieve functional amelioration is a realistic goal. However, studies so far have
rarely taken into consideration the preexisting inflammation triggered by the
disease process that could hamper the effectiveness of transplanted cells. Here, 
we examined the fate and long-term consequences of human cerebellar granule
neuron precursors (GNP) transplanted into the cerebellum of Harlequin mice, an
adult model of progressive cerebellar degeneration with early-onset microgliosis.
METHODS: Human embryonic stem cell-derived progenitors expressing Atoh1, a
transcription factor key to GNP specification, were generated in vitro and
stereotaxically transplanted into the cerebellum of preataxic Harlequin mice. The
histological and functional impact of these transplants was followed using
immunolabeling and Rotarod analysis.
RESULTS: Although transplanted GNPs did not survive beyond a few weeks, they
triggered the proliferation of endogenous nestin-positive precursors in the
leptomeninges that crossed the molecular layer and differentiated into mature
neurons. These phenomena were accompanied by the preservation of the granule and 
Purkinje cell layers and delayed ataxic changes. In vitro neurosphere generation 
confirmed the enhanced neurogenic potential of the cerebellar leptomeninges of
Harlequin mice transplanted with exogenous GNPs.
INTERPRETATION: The cerebellar leptomeninges of adult mice contain an endogenous 
neurogenic niche that can be stimulated to yield mature neurons from an as-yet
unidentified population of progenitors. The transplantation of human GNPs not
only stimulates this neurogenesis, but, despite the potentially hostile
environment, leads to neuroprotection and functional amelioration.

Fibroblast growth factors (Fgfs) play important roles in developmental processes 
of the inner ear, including the ontogeny of the statoacoustic ganglia (SAG) and
hair cells. However, the detailed genetic mechanism(s) underlying
Fgf/Fgfr-dependent otic neural development remains elusive. Using conditional
genetic approaches and inhibitory small molecules, we have revealed that
Fgfr-PI3K/Akt signaling is mainly responsible for zebrafish SAG development and
have determined that Sox9a and Atoh1a act downstream of Fgfr-Akt signaling to
specify and/or maintain the otic neuron fate during the early segmentation stage.
Sox9a and Atoh1a coregulate numerous downstream factors identified through our
ChIP-seq analyses, including Tlx2 and Eya2. Fgfr-Erk1/2 signaling contributes to 
ultricular hair cell development during a critical period between 9 and 15 hours 
postfertilization. Our work reveals that a genetic network of the previously
known sensory determinant Atoh1 and the neural crest determinant Sox9 plays
critical roles in SAG development. These newly uncovered roles for Atoh1and Sox9 
in zebrafish otic development may be relevant to study in other species.

Atoh1, Hes1 and Hes5 are crucial for normal inner ear hair cell development. They
regulate the expression of each other in a complex network, while they also
interact with many other genes and pathways, such as Notch, FGF, SHH, WNT, BMP
and RA. This paper summarized molecular pathways that involve Atoh1, Hes1, and
Hes5. Some of the pathways and gene regulation mechanisms discussed here were
studied in other tissues, yet they might inspire studies in inner ear hair cell
development. Thereby, we presented a complex regulatory network involving these
three genes, which might be crucial for proliferation and differentiation of
inner ear hair cells.

Merkel cell-neurite complexes are located in touch-sensitive areas of the
mammalian skin and are involved in recognition of the texture and shape of
objects. Merkel cells are essential for these tactile discriminations, as they
generate action potentials in response to touch stimuli and induce the firing of 
innervating afferent nerves. It has been shown that Merkel cells originate from
epidermal stem cells, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms of their
development are largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed Merkel cell
differentiation during development and found that it is a temporally regulated
maturation process characterized by a sequential activation of Merkel
cell-specific genes. We uncovered key transcription factors controlling this
process and showed that the transcription factor Atoh1 is required for initial
Merkel cell specification. The subsequent maturation steps of Merkel cell
differentiation are controlled by cooperative function of the transcription
factors Sox2 and Isl1, which physically interact and work to sustain Atoh1
expression. These findings reveal the presence of a robust transcriptional
network required to produce functional Merkel cells that are required for tactile
discrimination.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION: The vertebrate basic helix-loop-helix transcription
factor Atoh1 is essential for maturation and survival of mechanosensory hair
cells of the inner ear, neurogenesis, differentiation of the intestine,
homeostasis of the colon and is implicated in cancer progression. Given that
mutations in Atoh1 are detected in malignant tumours, study of functionally
different Atoh1 alleles and homologues might yield useful avenues for
investigation. The predicted sequence of chicken Atoh1 (cAtoh1) has large regions
of dissimilarity to that of mammalian Atoh1 homologues. We hypothesise that
cAtoh1 might have intrinsic functional differences to mammalian Atoh1.
RESULTS: In this study, we cloned and sequenced the full open reading frame of
cAtoh1. In overexpression experiments, we show that this sequence is sufficient
to generate a cAtoh1 protein capable of inducing hair cell markers when expressed
in nonsensory regions of the developing inner ear, and that morpholino-mediated
knock-down using a section of the sequence 5' to the start codon inhibits
differentiation of hair cells in the chicken basilar papilla. Furthermore, we
compare the behaviour of cAtoh1 and human Atoh1 (hAtoh1) in embryonic mouse
cochlear explants, showing that cAtoh1 is a potent inducer of hair cell
differentiation and that it can overcome Sox2-mediated repression of hair cell
differentiation more effectively than hAtoh1.
CONCLUSIONS: cAtoh1 is both necessary and sufficient for avian mechanosensory
hair cell differentiation. The non-conserved regions of the cAtoh1 coding region 
have functional consequences on its behaviour.

Atonal homolog 1 (Atoh1) is crucial to the differentiation of many cell types and
participates in tumorigenesis and progression. However, the expression of Atoh1
in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and its relationship to clinical
characteristics of this disease remain poorly understood. In this study,
immunohistochemical analysis using tissue microarray (TMA) was employed to
evaluate the expression of Atoh1 in GIST and the correlation between Atoh1
expression and clinicopathological features of GIST as well as patient outcome.
High Atoh1 cytoplasmic expression was observed in 77.22% of patients with GIST,
which was related to the mitotic index (P = 0.010) and AFIP-Miettinen risk
classification (P = 0.045). High Atoh1 nuclear expression was seen in 69.49% of
cases, which was associated with mitotic index (P = 0.003) and AFIP-Miettinen
risk classification (P = 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test
indicated that high Atoh1 cytoplasmic expression, high Atoh1 nuclear expression, 
small tumor diameter, low mitotic index and TNM stage significantly correlated
with improved survival of GIST patients. Overall, the data suggest that Atoh1
high expression correlates with a good prognosis and it may serve as a favorable 
prognostic factor for GIST. These results also support a role for Atoh1 as a
tumor suppressor gene in GIST.

Notch signaling plays a crucial role during inner ear development and
regeneration. Hes/Hey genes encode for bHLH transcription factors identified as
Notch targets. We have studied the expression and regulation of Hes/Hey genes
during inner ear development in the chicken embryo. Among several Hes/Hey genes
examined, only Hey1 and Hes5 map to the sensory regions, although with salient
differences. Hey1 expression follows Jag1 expression except at early prosensory
stages while Hes5 expression corresponds well to Dl1 expression throughout otic
development. Although Hey1 and Hes5 are direct Notch downstream targets, they
differ in the level of Notch required for activation. Moreover, they also differ 
in mRNA stability, showing different temporal decays after Notch blockade. In
addition, Bmp, Wnt and Fgf pathways also modify Hey1 and Hes5 expression in the
inner ear. Particularly, the Wnt pathway modulates Hey1 and Jag1 expression.
Finally, gain of function experiments show that Hey1 and Hes5 cross-regulate each
other in a complex manner. Both Hey1 and Hes5 repress Dl1 and Hes5 expression,
suggesting that they prevent the transition to differentiation stages, probably
by preventing Atoh1 expression. In spite of its association with Jag1, Hey1 does 
not seem to be instrumental for lateral induction as it does not promote Jag1
expression. We suggest that, besides being both targets of Notch, Hey1 and Hes5
are subject to a rather complex regulation that includes the stability of their
transcripts, cross regulation and other signaling pathways.

Atoh1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that controls
differentiation of hair cells (HCs) in the inner ear and its enhancer region has 
been used to create several HC-specific mouse lines. We generated a transgenic
tetracycline-inducible mouse line (called Atoh1-rtTA) using the Atoh1 enhancer to
drive expression of the reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) protein and
human placental alkaline phosphatase. Presence of the transgene was confirmed by 
alkaline phosphatase staining and rtTA activity was measured using two
tetracycline operator (TetO) reporter alleles with doxycycline administered
between postnatal days 0-3. This characterization of five founder lines
demonstrated that Atoh1-rtTA is expressed in the majority of cochlear and
utricular HCs. Although the tetracycline-inducible system is thought to produce
transient changes in gene expression, reporter positive HCs were still observed
at 6 weeks of age. To confirm that Atoh1-rtTA activity was specific to
Atoh1-expressing cells, we also analyzed the cerebellum and found rtTA-driven
reporter expression in cerebellar granule neuron precursor cells. The Atoh1-rtTA 
mouse line provides a powerful tool for the field and can be used in combination 
with other existing Cre recombinase mouse lines to manipulate expression of
multiple genes at different times in the same animal.

Atonal genes are basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that were first
identified as regulating the formation of mechanoreceptors and photoreceptors in 
Drosophila. Isolation of vertebrate homologs of atonal genes has shown these
transcription factors to play diverse roles in the development of neurons and
their progenitors, gut epithelial cells, and mechanosensory cells in the inner
ear and skin. In this article, we review the molecular function and regulation of
atonal genes and their targets, with particular emphasis on the function of Atoh1
in the development, survival, and function of hair cells of the inner ear. We
discuss cell-extrinsic signals that induce Atoh1 expression and the
transcriptional networks that regulate its expression during development.
Finally, we discuss recent work showing how identification of Atoh1 target genes 
in the cerebellum, spinal cord, and gut can be used to propose candidate Atoh1
targets in tissues such as the inner ear where cell numbers and biochemical
material are limiting.

The cerebellum is a pre-eminent model for the study of neurogenesis and circuit
assembly. Increasing interest in the cerebellum as a participant in higher
cognitive processes and as a locus for a range of disorders and diseases make
this simple yet elusive structure an important model in a number of fields. In
recent years, our understanding of some of the more familiar aspects of
cerebellar growth, such as its territorial allocation and the origin of its
various cell types, has undergone major recalibration. Furthermore, owing to its 
stereotyped circuitry across a range of species, insights from a variety of
species have contributed to an increasingly rich picture of how this system
develops. Here, we review these recent advances and explore three distinct
aspects of cerebellar development - allocation of the cerebellar anlage, the
significance of transit amplification and the generation of neuronal diversity - 
each defined by distinct regulatory mechanisms and each with special significance
for health and disease.

SMARCA4 (BRG1) and SMARCB1 (INI1) are tumor suppressor genes that are crucially
involved in the formation of malignant rhabdoid tumors, such as atypical
teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT). AT/RTs typically affect infants and occur at
various sites of the CNS with a particular frequency in the cerebellum. Here,
granule neurons and their progenitors represent the most abundant cell type and
are known to give rise to a subset of medulloblastoma, a histologically similar
embryonal brain tumor. To test how Smarc proteins influence the development of
granule neurons and whether this population may serve as cellular origin for
AT/RTs, we specifically deleted Smarca4 and Smarcb1 in cerebellar granule cell
precursors. Respective mutant mice displayed severe ataxia and motor coordination
deficits, but did not develop any tumors. In fact, they suffered from a severely 
hypoplastic cerebellum due to a significant inhibition of granule neuron
precursor proliferation. Molecularly, this was accompanied by an enhanced
activity of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling that, by itself, is known to cause a nearly
identical phenotype. We further used an hGFAP-cre allele, which deleted Smarcb1
much earlier and in a wider neural precursor population, but we still did not
detect any tumor formation in the CNS. In summary, our results emphasize
cell-type-dependent roles of Smarc proteins and argue against cerebellar granule 
cells and other progeny of hGFAP-positive neural precursors as the cellular
origin for AT/RTs.

Aberrant activation of Notch signaling has an essential role in colorectal cancer
(CRC) progression. Amplified in breast cancer 1 (AIB1), also known as steroid
receptor coactivator 3 or NCOA3, is a transcriptional coactivator that promotes
cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness. However, AIB1 implication in CRC
progression through enhancing Notch signaling is unknown. In this study, we found
that several CRC cell lines expressed high levels of AIB1, and knockdown of AIB1 
decreased cell proliferation, colony formation and tumorigenesis of these CRC
cells. Specifically, knockdown of AIB1 inhibited cell cycle progression at G1
phase by decreasing the mRNA levels of cyclin A2, cyclin B1, cyclin E2 and hairy 
and enhancer of split (Hes) 1. Furthermore, AIB1 interacted with Notch
intracellular domain and Mastermind-like 1 and was recruited to the Hes1 promoter
to enhance Notch signaling. Downregulation of AIB1 also decreased CRC cell
invasiveness in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo. Besides that, knockout of AIB1
in mice inhibited colon carcinogenesis induced by azoxymethane/dextran sodium
sulfate treatment. The mRNA levels of cyclin B1 and Hes5 were downregulated, but 
p27, ATOH1 and MUC2 were upregulated in the colon tumors from AIB1-deficient mice
compared with those from wild-type mice. Thus, our results signify the importance
of AIB1 in CRC and demonstrate that AIB1 promotes CRC progression at least in
part through enhancing Notch signaling, suggesting that AIB1 is a potential
molecular target for CRC treatment.

Proneural genes encode evolutionarily conserved basic-helix-loop-helix
transcription factors. In Drosophila, proneural genes are required and sufficient
to confer a neural identity onto naïve ectodermal cells, inducing delamination
and subsequent neuronal differentiation. In vertebrates, proneural genes are
expressed in cells that already have a neural identity, but they are still
required and sufficient to initiate neurogenesis. In all organisms, proneural
genes control neurogenesis by regulating Notch-mediated lateral inhibition and
initiating the expression of downstream differentiation genes. The general mode
of proneural gene function has thus been elucidated. However, the regulatory
mechanisms that spatially and temporally control proneural gene function are only
beginning to be deciphered. Understanding how proneural gene function is
regulated is essential, as aberrant proneural gene expression has recently been
linked to a variety of human diseases-ranging from cancer to neuropsychiatric
illnesses and diabetes. Recent insights into proneural gene function in
development and disease are highlighted herein.

cell differentiation downstream of Hedgehog signaling.

Mechano-sensory hair cells (HCs), housed in the inner ear cochlea, are critical
for the perception of sound. In the mammalian cochlea, differentiation of HCs
occurs in a striking basal-to-apical and medial-to-lateral gradient, which is
thought to ensure correct patterning and proper function of the auditory sensory 
epithelium. Recent studies have revealed that Hedgehog signaling opposes HC
differentiation and is critical for the establishment of the graded pattern of
auditory HC differentiation. However, how Hedgehog signaling interferes with HC
differentiation is unknown. Here, we provide evidence that in the murine cochlea,
Hey1 and Hey2 control the spatiotemporal pattern of HC differentiation downstream
of Hedgehog signaling. It has been recently shown that HEY1 and HEY2, two highly 
redundant HES-related transcriptional repressors, are highly expressed in
supporting cell (SC) and HC progenitors (prosensory cells), but their prosensory 
function remained untested. Using a conditional double knock-out strategy, we
demonstrate that prosensory cells form and proliferate properly in the absence of
Hey1 and Hey2 but differentiate prematurely because of precocious upregulation of
the pro-HC factor Atoh1. Moreover, we demonstrate that prosensory-specific
expression of Hey1 and Hey2 and its subsequent graded downregulation is
controlled by Hedgehog signaling in a largely FGFR-dependent manner. In summary, 
our study reveals a critical role for Hey1 and Hey2 in prosensory cell
maintenance and identifies Hedgehog signaling as a novel upstream regulator of
their prosensory function in the mammalian cochlea. The regulatory mechanism
described here might be a broadly applied mechanism for controlling progenitor
behavior in the central and peripheral nervous system.

Math1 is the defining molecule of the cerebellar rhombic lip and Pax6 is
downstream in the Math1 pathway. In the present study, we discover that Wntless
(Wls) is a novel molecular marker of the cells in the interior face of the
rhombic lip throughout normal mouse cerebellar development. Wls expression is
found complementary to the expression of Math1 and Pax6, which are localized to
the exterior face of the rhombic lip. To determine the interaction between these 
molecules, we examine the loss-of-Math1 or loss-of-Pax6 in the cerebellum, i.e., 
the Math1-null and Pax6-null (Sey) mutant cerebella. The presence of Wls-positive
cells in the Math1-null rhombic lip indicates that Wls expression is independent 
of Math1. In the Sey mutant cerebellum, there is an expansion of Wls-expressing
cells into regions that are normally colonized by Pax6-expressing cells. The
ectopic expression of Wls in the Pax6-null cerebellum suggests a negative
interaction between Wls-expressing cells and Pax6-positive cells. These findings 
suggest that the rhombic lip is dynamically patterned by the expression of Wls,
Math1, and Pax6. We also examine five rhombic lip cell markers (Wls, Math1, Pax6,
Lmx1a, and Tbr2) to identify four molecularly distinct compartments in the
rhombic lip during cerebellar development. The existence of spatial
compartmentation in the rhombic lip and the interplay between Wls, Math1, and
Pax6 in the rhombic lip provides novel views of early cerebellar development.

The degeneration of hair cells in the mammalian cochlea results in permanent
sensorineural hearing loss. This study aimed to promote the regeneration of
sensory hair cells in the mature cochlea and their reconnection with auditory
neurons through the introduction of ATOH1, a transcription factor known to be
necessary for hair cell development, and the introduction of neurotrophic
factors. Adenoviral vectors containing ATOH1 alone, or with neurotrophin-3 and
brain derived neurotrophic factor were injected into the lower basal scala media 
of guinea pig cochleae four days post ototoxic deafening. Guinea pigs treated
with ATOH1 gene therapy, alone, had a significantly greater number of cells
expressing hair cell markers compared to the contralateral non-treated cochlea
when examined 3 weeks post-treatment. This increase, however, did not result in a
commensurate improvement in hearing thresholds, nor was there an increase in
synaptic ribbons, as measured by CtBP2 puncta after ATOH1 treatment alone, or
when combined with neurotrophins. However, hair cell formation and synaptogenesis
after co-treatment with ATOH1 and neurotrophic factors remain inconclusive as
viral transduction was reduced due to the halving of viral titres when the
samples were combined. Collectively, these data suggest that, whilst ATOH1 alone 
can drive non-sensory cells towards an immature sensory hair cell phenotype in
the mature cochlea, this does not result in functional improvements after
aminoglycoside-induced deafness.

Transcription factors with conserved binding sites near ATOH1 on the POU4F3 gene 
enhance the induction of cochlear hair cells.

Ikeda R, Pak K, Chavez E, Ryan AF.

Overexpression of the transcription factor (TF) ATOH1 is known to induce the
transformation of nonsensory cells in the organ of Corti into hair cells (HCs).
Evaluating DNA 5Œ to the coding sequence of the pou4f3 gene, a target of ATOH1
in HCs, we identified in three regions containing clustered binding sites for
ATOH1 and several other TFs that are expressed in developing inner ear sensory
epithelia at the time of HC specification. These regions and sites are highly
conserved across evolutionarily distant mammalian species. To test the hypothesis
that the identified TFs act in combination to regulate the pou4f3 gene, we
transfected by electroporation neonatal cochlear sensory epithelium from mice
expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of an 8.5-kb 5'
pou4f3 genomic fragment. Plasmids encoding 21 TFs c-transfected with human ATOH1 
(hATOH1). Cotransfection with hETV4, hNMYC, or hETS2 produced significantly more 
pou4f3/GFP and myosin 7A-positive nonsensory cells than hATOH1 alone.
Co-transfection of hATOH1 with hHES1, hHES5, or hNEUROD1 reduced the effects of
hATOH1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)of DNA from an inner ear cell line
transfected with hNMYC,hETV4, or hETS2 revealed binding to a conserved region
immediately proximal to the coding sequence. ChIP similarly revealed binding of
hGATA3, hNMYC, and hTFE2 to a region several kilobases distal to the coding
sequence, which we have previously shown to bind ATOH1. The results suggest that 
ATOH1 acts in concert with a subset of other TFs to directly regulate the pou4f3 
gene and more broadly to regulate the HC phenotype.

The cerebellum has evolved elaborate foliation in the amniote lineage as a
consequence of extensive Atoh1-mediated transit amplification in an external
germinal layer (EGL) comprising granule cell precursors. To explore the
evolutionary origin of this layer, we have examined the molecular geography of
cerebellar development throughout the life cycle of Xenopus laevis. At
metamorphic stages Xenopus displays a superficial granule cell layer that is not 
proliferative and expresses both Atoh1 and NeuroD1, a marker of postmitotic
cerebellar granule cells. Premature misexpression of NeuroD1 in chick partially
recapitulates the amphibian condition by suppressing transit amplification.
However, unlike in the amphibian, granule cells fail to enter the EGL.
Furthermore, misexpression of NeuroD1 once the EGL is established both triggers
radial migration and downregulates Atoh1. These results show that the evolution
of transit amplification in the EGL required adaptation of NeuroD1, both in the
timing of its expression and in its regulatory function, with respect to Atoh1.

Microbial sensing by goblet cells controls immune surveillance of luminal
antigens in the colon.

The delivery of luminal substances across the intestinal epithelium to the immune
system is a critical event in immune surveillance, resulting in tolerance to
dietary antigens and immunity to pathogens. How this process is regulated is
largely unknown. Recently goblet cell-associated antigen passages (GAPs) were
identified as a pathway delivering luminal antigens to underlying lamina propria 
(LP) dendritic cells in the steady state. Here, we demonstrate that goblet cells 
(GCs) form GAPs in response to acetylcholine (ACh) acting on muscarinic ACh
receptor 4. GAP formation in the small intestine was regulated at the level of
ACh production, as GCs rapidly formed GAPs in response to ACh analogs. In
contrast, colonic GAP formation was regulated at the level of GC responsiveness
to ACh. Myd88-dependent microbial sensing by colonic GCs inhibited the ability of
colonic GCs to respond to Ach to form GAPs and deliver luminal antigens to
colonic LP-antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Disruption of GC microbial sensing in
the setting of an intact gut microbiota opened colonic GAPs, and resulted in
recruitment of neutrophils and APCs and production of inflammatory cytokines.
Thus GC intrinsic sensing of the microbiota has a critical role regulating the
exposure of the colonic immune system to luminal substances.

Signaling networks controlled by Sonic hedgehog (SHH) and the transcription
factor Atoh1 regulate the proliferation and differentiation of cerebellar granule
neuron progenitors (GNPs). Deregulations in those developmental processes lead to
medulloblastoma formation, the most common malignant brain tumor in childhood.
Although the protein Atoh1 is a key factor during both cerebellar development and
medulloblastoma formation, up-to-date detailed mechanisms underlying its function
and regulation have remained poorly understood. Here, we report that SHH
regulates Atoh1 stability by preventing its phosphodependent degradation by the
E3 ubiquitin ligase Huwe1. Our results reveal that SHH and Atoh1 contribute to a 
positive autoregulatory loop promoting neuronal precursor expansion.
Consequently, Huwe1 loss in mouse SHH medulloblastoma illustrates the disruption 
of this developmental mechanism in cancer. Hence, the crosstalk between SHH
signaling and Atoh1 during cerebellar development highlights a collaborative
network that could be further targeted in medulloblastoma.

Mouse utricle sensory epithelial cell-derived progenitor cells (MUCs), which have
hair cell progenitor and mesenchymal features via epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) as previously described, provide a potential approach for hair
cell regeneration via cell transplantation. In this study, we treated MUCs with
trichostatin A (TSA) to determine whether histone deacetylase inhibitor is able
to stimulate the expression of epithelial genes in MUCs, an essential step for
guiding mesenchymal-like MUCs to become sensory epithelial cells. After 72 h of
TSA treatment, MUCs acquired epithelial-like features, which were indicated by
increased expression of epithelial markers such as Cdh1, Krt18, and Dsp.
Additionally, TSA decreased the expression of mesenchymal markers, including
Zeb1, Zeb2, Snai1, and Snai2, and prosensory genes Lfng, Six1, and Dlx5.
Moreover, the expression of the hair cell genes Atoh1 and Myo6 was increased in
TSA-treated MUCs. We also observed significantly decreased expression of Hdac2
and Hdac3 in TSA-treated MUCs. However, no remarkable change was detected in
protein expression using immunofluorescence, indicating that TSA-induced HDAC
inhibition may contribute to the initial stage of the mesenchymal-to-epithelial
phenotypic change. In the future, more work is needed to induce hair cell
regeneration using inner ear tissue-derived progenitors to achieve an entire
mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition.

Hirschsprung disease-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) leads to significant
mortality and morbidity, but its pathogenesis remains unknown. Changes in the
colonic epithelium related to goblet cells and the luminal mucus layer have been 
postulated to play a key role. Here we show that the colonic epithelium of both
aganglionic and ganglionic segments are altered in patients and in mice with
Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). Structurally, goblet cells were altered with
increased goblet cell number and reduced intracellular mucins in the distal colon
of biopsies from patients with HSCR. Endothelin receptor B (Ednrb) mutant mice
showed increased goblet cell number and size and increased cell proliferation
compared to wild-type mice in aganglionic segments, and reduced goblet cell size 
and number in ganglionic segments. Functionally, compared to littermates,
Ednrb-/- mice showed increased transepithelial resistance, reduced stool water
content and similar chloride secretion in the distal colon. Transcript levels of 
goblet cell differentiation factors SPDEF and Math1 were increased in the distal 
colon of Ednrb-/- mice. Both distal colon from Ednrb mice and biopsies from HSCR 
patients showed reduced Muc4 expression as compared to controls, but similar
expression of Muc2. Particle tracking studies showed that mucus from Ednrb-/-
mice provided a more significant barrier to diffusion of 200 nm nanoparticles as 
compared to wild-type mice. These results suggest that aganglionosis is
associated with increased goblet cell proliferation and differentiation and
subsequent altered surface mucus properties, prior to the development of
inflammation in the distal colon epithelium. Restoration of normal goblet cell
function and mucus layer properties in the colonic epithelium may represent a
therapeutic strategy for prevention of HAEC.

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Determine the optimal design characteristics of an
adenoviral (Ad) vector to deliver atoh1 and induce regeneration of vestibular
hair cells.
STUDY DESIGN: Evaluation of a mouse model of intralabyrinthine gene delivery.
Tissue culture of mouse and human macular organs.
METHODS: Macular organs from adult C57Bl/6 mice were treated with binding
modified and alternate adenovectors expressing green fluorescent protein (gfp) or
luciferase (L). Expression of marker genes was determined over time to determine 
vector transfection efficiency. The inner ear of adult mice was then injected
with modified vectors. Expression of gfp and distribution of vector DNA was
followed. Hearing and balance function was evaluated in normal animals to ensure 
safety of the novel vector designs. An optimized vector was identified and tested
for its ability to induce hair cell regeneration in a mouse vestibulopathy model.
Finally, this vector was tested for its ability to induce hair cell regeneration 
in human tissue.
RESULTS: Ad5 serotype-based vectors were identified as having a variety of
different binding capacities for inner ear tissue. This makes it difficult to
limit the dose of vector due to entry into nontargeted cells. Screening of rare
adenovector serotypes demonstrated that Ad-based vectors were ideally suited for 
delivery to supporting cells; therefore, they were useful for hair cell
regeneration studies. Utilization of an Ad28-based vector to deliver atoh1 to a
mouse model of vestibular loss resulted in significant functional recovery of
balance. This vector was also capable of transfecting human macular organs and
inducing regeneration of human vestibular hair cells in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in vector design can lead to more specific cell-based
delivery and reduction of nonspecific delivery of the trans gene, leading to the 
development of optimized molecular therapeutics to induce hair cell regeneration.

Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are a promising cell resource for various
applications in regenerative medicine. Highly efficient approaches that
differentiate human PSCs into functional lineage-specific neurons are critical
for modeling neurological disorders and testing potential therapies. Proneural
transcription factors are crucial drivers of neuron development and hold promise 
for driving highly efficient neuronal conversion in PSCs. Here, we study the
functions of proneural transcription factor Atoh1 in the neuronal differentiation
of PSCs. We show that Atoh1 is induced during the neuronal conversion of PSCs and
that ectopic Atoh1 expression is sufficient to drive PSCs into neurons with high 
efficiency. Atoh1 induction, in combination with cell extrinsic factors,
differentiates PSCs into functional dopaminergic (DA) neurons with >80% purity.
Atoh1-induced DA neurons recapitulate key biochemical and electrophysiological
features of midbrain DA neurons, the degeneration of which is responsible for
clinical symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Atoh1-induced DA neurons provide a
reliable disease model for studying PD pathogenesis, such as neurotoxin-induced
neurodegeneration in PD. Overall, our results determine the role of Atoh1 in
regulating neuronal differentiation and neuron subtype specification of human
PSCs. Our Atoh1-mediated differentiation approach will enable large-scale
applications of PD patient-derived midbrain DA neurons in mechanistic studies and
drug screening for both familial and sporadic PD.

Reports have suggested that the two Notch ligands, Dll1 and Dll4, are
indispensable to maintain the homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium. However, 
within the intestinal epithelium, the precise distribution of the cells that
express those ligands at the protein level remains largely unknown. Here, we show
a series of immunohistochemical analysis through which we successfully identified
mice intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) that endogenously express Dll1 or Dll4.
Results showed that Dll1-positive (Dll1+ve) IECs reside exclusively within the
crypt, whereas Dll4-positive (Dll4+ve) IECs can locate both in the crypt and in
the villus of the small intestine. Also in the colon, Dll1+ve IECs resided at the
lower part of the crypt, whereas Dll4+ve IECs resided at both upper and lower
part of the crypt, including the surface epithelium. Both Dll1+ve and Dll4+ve
IECs were ATOH1-positive, but Hes1-negative cells, and located adjacent to
Hes1-positive cells within the crypts. A sub-population of both Dll1+ve and
Dll4+ve IECs appeared to co-express Muc2, but rarely co-expressed other secretory
lineage markers. However, as compared to Dll1+ve IECs, Dll4+ve IECs included
larger number of Muc2-postive IECs, suggesting that Dll4 is more preferentially
expressed by goblet cells. Also, we identified that Dll4 is expressed in the
Paneth cells of the small intestine, whereas Dll1 and Dll4 is expressed in the
c-kit-positive IECs of the colon, indicating that Dll1+ve and Dll4+ve IECs may
contribute to constitute the intestinal stem cell niche. Compared to the normal
colon, analysis of DSS-colitis showed that number of Dll1+ve IECs significantly
decrease in the elongated crypts of the inflamed colonic mucosa. In sharp
contrast, number of Dll4+ve IECs showed a significant increase in those crypts,
which was accompanied by the increase in number of Hes1-positive IECs. Those
Dll4+ve IECs were mostly found adjacent to the Hes1-positive IECs, suggesting
that Dll4 may act as a major Notch ligand in the crypts of the inflamed colonic
mucosa. Our results illustrate distinct expression patterns of Dll1 and Dll4
within the intestinal epithelium, and suggest that these two ligands may have
different roles in normal and inflamed mucosa.

All motor behaviors require precise temporal coordination of different muscle
groups. Breathing, for example, involves the sequential activation of numerous
muscles hypothesized to be driven by a primary respiratory oscillator, the
preBötzinger Complex, and at least one other as-yet unidentified rhythmogenic
population. We tested the roles of Atoh1-, Phox2b-, and Dbx1-derived neurons
(three groups that have known roles in respiration) in the generation and
coordination of respiratory output. We found that Dbx1-derived neurons are
necessary for all respiratory behaviors, whereas independent but coupled
respiratory rhythms persist from at least three different motor pools after
eliminating or silencing Phox2b- or Atoh1-expressing hindbrain neurons. Without
Atoh1 neurons, however, the motor pools become temporally disorganized and
coupling between independent respiratory oscillators decreases. We propose Atoh1 
neurons tune the sequential activation of independent oscillators essential for
the fine control of different muscles during breathing.DOI:

During inner ear development, Notch exhibits two modes of operation: lateral
induction, which is associated with prosensory specification, and lateral
inhibition, which is involved in hair cell determination. These mechanisms depend
respectively on two different ligands, jagged 1 (Jag1) and delta 1 (Dl1), that
rely on a common signaling cascade initiated after Notch activation. In the
chicken otocyst, expression of Jag1 and the Notch target Hey1 correlates well
with lateral induction, whereas both Jag1 and Dl1 are expressed during lateral
inhibition, as are Notch targets Hey1 and Hes5. Here, we show that Jag1 drives
lower levels of Notch activity than Dl1, which results in the differential
expression of Hey1 and Hes5. In addition, Jag1 interferes with the ability of Dl1
to elicit high levels of Notch activity. Modeling the sensory epithelium when the
two ligands are expressed together shows that ligand regulation, differential
signaling strength and ligand competition are crucial to allow the two modes of
operation and for establishing the alternate pattern of hair cells and supporting
cells. Jag1, while driving lateral induction on its own, facilitates patterning
by lateral inhibition in the presence of Dl1. This novel behavior emerges from
Jag1 acting as a competitive inhibitor of Dl1 for Notch signaling. Both modeling 
and experiments show that hair cell patterning is very robust. The model suggests
that autoactivation of proneural factor Atoh1, upstream of Dl1, is a fundamental 
component for robustness. The results stress the importance of the levels of
Notch signaling and ligand competition for Notch function.

The development of hair cells in the auditory system can be separated into steps;
first, the establishment of progenitors for the sensory epithelium, and second,
the differentiation of hair cells. Although the differentiation of hair cells is 
known to require the expression of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor,
Atoh1, the control of cell proliferation in the region of the developing cochlea 
that will ultimately become the sensory epithelium and the cues that initiate
Atoh1 expression remain obscure. We assessed the role of Wnt/ß-catenin in both
steps in gain- and loss-of-function models in mice. The canonical Wnt pathway
mediator, ß-catenin, controls the expression of Atoh1. Knock-out of ß-catenin
inhibited hair-cell, as well as pillar-cell, differentiation from sensory
progenitors but was not required to maintain a hair-cell fate once specified.
Constitutive activation of ß-catenin expanded sensory progenitors by inducing
additional cell division and resulted in the differentiation of extra hair cells.
Our data demonstrate that ß-catenin plays a role in cell division and
differentiation in the cochlear sensory epithelium.

Transcriptome of Atoh7 retinal progenitor cells identifies new Atoh7-dependent
regulatory genes for retinal ganglion cell formation.

The bHLH transcription factor ATOH7 (Math5) is essential for establishing retinal
ganglion cell (RGC) fate. However, Atoh7-expressing retinal progenitor cells
(RPCs) can give rise to all retinal cell types, suggesting that other factors are
involved in specifying RGCs. The basis by which a subpopulation of
Atoh7-expressing RPCs commits to an RGC fate remains uncertain but is of critical
importance to retinal development since RGCs are the earliest cell type to
differentiate. To better understand the regulatory mechanisms leading to
cell-fate specification, a binary genetic system was generated to specifically
label Atoh7-expressing cells with green fluorescent protein (GFP).
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified GFP(+) and GFP(-) cells were 
profiled by RNA-seq. Here, we identify 1497 transcripts that were differentially 
expressed between the two RPC populations. Pathway analysis revealed diminished
growth factor signaling in Atoh7-expressing RPCs, indicating that these cells had
exited the cell cycle. In contrast, axon guidance signals were enriched,
suggesting that axons of Atoh7-expressing RPCs were already making synaptic
connections. Notably, many genes enriched in Atoh7-expressing RPCs encoded
transcriptional regulators, and several were direct targets of ATOH7, including, 
and unexpectedly, Ebf3 and Eya2. We present evidence for a Pax6-Atoh7-Eya2
pathway that acts downstream of Atoh7 but upstream of differentiation factor
Pou4f2. EYA2 is a protein phosphatase involved in protein-protein interactions
and posttranslational regulation. These properties, along with Eya2 as an early
target gene of ATOH7, suggest that EYA2 functions in RGC specification. Our
results expand current knowledge of the regulatory networks operating in
Atoh7-expressing RPCs and offer new directions for exploring the earliest aspects
of retinogenesis.

Atonal homolog 1 (Atoh1) is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is
essential for inner ear hair cell differentiation. Previous studies have reported
that Atoh1 gene transfer induces the production of ectopic hair cell-like cells
(EHCLCs). In the present study, the effect of different Atoh1 expression levels
and the duration of EHCLC formation on the lesser epithelial ridge (LER) of
cochleae was examined using a human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) vector encoding
atoh1 and the reporter gene EGFP. Different Ad5-EGFP-atoh1/Ad5-EGFP virus titers 
were added to cultured cochlear explants and EHCLCs were detected in the LER at
various time points. The results demonstrated that GFP alone did not induce
EHCLCs. By contrast, Atoh1 expression induced EHCLCs as early as 2.5-5 days
following EGFP-atoh1 infection in the LER and depending upon the viral titer, the
number of EHCLCs increased with time. Higher Ad5-EGFP-atoh1 titers induced
enhanced Atoh1 expression, resulting in an increase in EHCLCs. Lower
Ad5-EGFP-atoh1 titers required more time for EHCLC formation and very low titers 
of Ad5-EGFP-atoh1 induced only weak Atoh1 expression and did not trigger EHCLC
formation. In conclusion, the present study utilized an appropriate
Ad5-EGFP-atoh1 titer range to induce Atoh1 expression and the subsequent
production of EHCLCs. The results revealed that the Atoh1 expression level
defined the fate of LER cells as either EHCLCs or nonsensory epithelial cells.
This evidence may provide an important guideline for future studies into gene
therapy strategies for the treatment of deafness.

Touch submodalities, such as flutter and pressure, are mediated by somatosensory 
afferents whose terminal specializations extract tactile features and encode them
as action potential trains with unique activity patterns. Whether non-neuronal
cells tune touch receptors through active or passive mechanisms is debated.
Terminal specializations are thought to function as passive mechanical filters
analogous to the cochlea's basilar membrane, which deconstructs complex sounds
into tones that are transduced by mechanosensory hair cells. The model that
cutaneous specializations are merely passive has been recently challenged because
epidermal cells express sensory ion channels and neurotransmitters; however,
direct evidence that epidermal cells excite tactile afferents is lacking.
Epidermal Merkel cells display features of sensory receptor cells and make
'synapse-like' contacts with slowly adapting type I (SAI) afferents. These
complexes, which encode spatial features such as edges and texture, localize to
skin regions with high tactile acuity, including whisker follicles, fingertips
and touch domes. Here we show that Merkel cells actively participate in touch
reception in mice. Merkel cells display fast, touch-evoked mechanotransduction
currents. Optogenetic approaches in intact skin show that Merkel cells are both
necessary and sufficient for sustained action-potential firing in tactile
afferents. Recordings from touch-dome afferents lacking Merkel cells demonstrate 
that Merkel cells confer high-frequency responses to dynamic stimuli and enable
sustained firing. These data are the first, to our knowledge, to directly
demonstrate a functional, excitatory connection between epidermal cells and
sensory neurons. Together, these findings indicate that Merkel cells actively
tune mechanosensory responses to facilitate high spatio-temporal acuity.
Moreover, our results indicate a division of labour in the Merkel cell-neurite
complex: Merkel cells signal static stimuli, such as pressure, whereas sensory
afferents transduce dynamic stimuli, such as moving gratings. Thus, the Merkel
cell-neurite complex is an unique sensory structure composed of two different
receptor cell types specialized for distinct elements of discriminative touch.

Msx1 and Msx2 act as essential activators of Atoh1 expression in the murine
spinal cord.

Dorsal spinal neurogenesis is orchestrated by the combined action of signals
secreted from the roof plate organizer and a downstream transcriptional cascade. 
Within this cascade, Msx1 and Msx2, two homeodomain transcription factors (TFs), 
are induced earlier than bHLH neuralizing TFs. Whereas bHLH TFs have been shown
to specify neuronal cell fate, the function of Msx genes remains poorly defined. 
We describe dramatic alterations of neuronal patterning in Msx1/Msx2
double-mutant mouse embryos. The most dorsal spinal progenitor pool fails to
express the bHLH neuralizing TF Atoh1, which results in a lack of Lhx2-positive
and Barhl2-positive dI1 interneurons. Neurog1 and Ascl1 expression territories
are dorsalized, leading to ectopic dorsal differentiation of dI2 and dI3
interneurons. In proportion, the amount of Neurog1-expressing progenitors appears
unaffected, whereas the number of Ascl1-positive cells is increased. These
defects occur while BMP signaling is still active in the Msx1/Msx2 mutant
embryos. Cell lineage analysis and co-immunolabeling demonstrate that
Atoh1-positive cells derive from progenitors expressing both Msx1 and Msx2. In
vitro, Msx1 and Msx2 proteins activate Atoh1 transcription by specifically
interacting with several homeodomain binding sites in the Atoh1 3' enhancer. In
vivo, Msx1 and Msx2 are required for Atoh1 3' enhancer activity and ChIP
experiments confirm Msx1 binding to this regulatory sequence. These data support 
a novel function of Msx1 and Msx2 as transcriptional activators. Our study
provides new insights into the transcriptional control of spinal cord patterning 
by BMP signaling, with Msx1 and Msx2 acting upstream of Atoh1.

In the cerebellum, the bHLH transcription factors Ptf1a and Atoh1 are expressed
in distinct neuroepithelial regions, the ventricular zone (VZ) and the rhombic
lip (RL), and are required for producing GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons,
respectively. However, it is unclear whether Ptf1a or Atoh1 is sufficient for
specifying GABAergic or glutamatergic neuronal fates. To test this, we generated 
two novel knock-in mouse lines, Ptf1a(Atoh1) and Atoh1(Ptf1a), that are designed 
to express Atoh1 and Ptf1a ectopically in the VZ and RL, respectively. In
Ptf1a(Atoh1) embryos, ectopically Atoh1-expressing VZ cells produced
glutamatergic neurons, including granule cells and deep cerebellar nuclei
neurons. Correspondingly, in Atoh1(Ptf1a) animals, ectopically Ptf1a-expressing
RL cells produced GABAergic populations, such as Purkinje cells and GABAergic
interneurons. Consistent results were also obtained from in utero electroporation
of Ptf1a or Atoh1 into embryonic cerebella, suggesting that Ptf1a and Atoh1 are
essential and sufficient for GABAergic versus glutamatergic specification in the 
neuroepithelium. Furthermore, birthdating analyses with BrdU in the knock-in mice
or with electroporation studies showed that ectopically produced fate-changed
neuronal types were generated at temporal schedules closely simulating those of
the wild-type RL and VZ, suggesting that the VZ and RL share common temporal
information. Observations of knock-in brains as well as electroporated brains
revealed that Ptf1a and Atoh1 mutually negatively regulate their expression,
probably contributing to formation of non-overlapping neuroepithelial domains.
These findings suggest that Ptf1a and Atoh1 specify spatial identities of
cerebellar neuron progenitors in the neuroepithelium, leading to appropriate
production of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, respectively.

In mammals, hair cells may be damaged or lost due to genetic mutation, infectious
disease, chemical ototoxicity, noise and other factors, causing permanent
sensorineural deafness. Regeneration of hair cells is a basic pre-requisite for
recovery of hearing in deaf animals. The inner ear stem cells in the organ of
Corti and vestibular utricle are the most ideal precursors for regeneration of
inner ear hair cells. This review highlights some recent findings concerning the 
proliferation and differentiation of inner ear stem cells. The differentiation of
inner ear stem cells into hair cells involves a series of signaling pathways and 
regulatory factors. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the related
studies.

The evolution of the vertebrate cerebellum: absence of a proliferative external
granule layer in a non-teleost ray-finned fish.

The cerebellum represents one of the most morphologically variable structures in 
the vertebrate brain. To shed light on its evolutionary history, we have examined
the molecular anatomy and proliferation of the developing cerebellum of the North
American paddlefish, Polyodon spathula. Absence of an external proliferative
cerebellar layer and the restriction of Atonal1 expression to the rhombic lip and
valvular primordium demonstrate that transit amplification in a cerebellar
external germinal layer, a prominent feature of amniote cerebellum development,
is absent in paddlefish. Furthermore, expression of Sonic hedgehog, which drives 
secondary proliferation in the mouse cerebellum, is absent from the paddlefish
cerebellum. These data are consistent with what has been observed in zebrafish
and suggest that the transit amplification seen in the amniote cerebellum was
either lost very early in the ray-finned fish lineage or evolved in the
lobe-finned fish lineage. We also suggest that the Atoh1-positive proliferative
valvular primordium may represent a synapomorphy (shared derived character) of
ray-finned fishes. The topology of valvular primordium development in paddlefish 
differs significantly from that of zebrafish and correlates with the adult
cerebellar form. The distribution of proliferative granule cell precursors in
different vertebrate taxa is thus the likely determining factor in cerebellar
morphological diversity.

Hearing impairment is primarily attributed to inner ear hair cell (HC) defects
that subsequently lead to spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) loss. The HC loss cannot
be self-repaired because of the HCs' limited capacity to regenerate in mammals.
Atoh1, also known as Math1, Hath1, and Cath1, is a proneural basic
helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that played a major role in HC
differentiation. Atoh1 activity at various developmental stages can sufficiently 
drive HC differentiation in the cochlea. Recent issues of a certain publication
have identified that Atoh1 is essential for inner ear development, such as cell
growth, morphogenesis, differentiation, cellular maintenance, and survival. We
summarize the new findings in Atoh1 research and identify the mechanisms
underlying the role of Atoh1 in HC regeneration to launch the future of Atoh1
therapy.

Cdc42 is a key regulator of dynamic actin organization. However, little is known 
about how Cdc42-dependent actin regulation influences steady-state actin
structures in differentiated epithelia. We employed inner ear hair-cell-specific 
conditional knockout to analyze the role of Cdc42 in hair cells possessing highly
elaborate stable actin protrusions (stereocilia). Hair cells of
Atoh1-Cre;Cdc42(flox/flox) mice developed normally but progressively degenerated 
after maturation, resulting in progressive hearing loss particularly at high
frequencies. Cochlear hair cell degeneration was more robust in inner hair cells 
than in outer hair cells, and began as stereocilia fusion and depletion,
accompanied by a thinning and waving circumferential actin belt at apical
junctional complexes (AJCs). Adenovirus-encoded GFP-Cdc42 expression in hair
cells and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging of hair cells
from transgenic mice expressing a Cdc42-FRET biosensor indicated Cdc42 presence
and activation at stereociliary membranes and AJCs in cochlear hair cells.
Cdc42-knockdown in MDCK cells produced phenotypes similar to those of
Cdc42-deleted hair cells, including abnormal microvilli and disrupted AJCs, and
downregulated actin turnover represented by enhanced levels of phosphorylated
cofilin. Thus, Cdc42 influenced the maintenance of stable actin structures
through elaborate tuning of actin turnover, and maintained function and viability
of cochlear hair cells.

Sensory hair cell loss is the major cause of hearing and balance disorders.
Mammals are incapable of sustained hair cell regeneration, but lower vertebrates 
can regenerate these mechano-electrical transducers. We present the first
comprehensive transcriptome (by mRNA-Seq) of hair cell regeneration in the chick 
utricle. We provide pathway and pattern annotations and correlate these with the 
phenotypic events that occur during regeneration. These patterns are surprisingly
synchronous and highly punctuated. We show how these patterns are a new resource 
for identifying components of the hair cell transcriptome and identify 494 new
putative hair-cell-specific genes and validate three of these (of three tested)
by immunohistochemical staining. We describe many surprising new components and
dynamic expression patterns, particularly within NOTCH signaling. For example, we
show that HES7 is specifically expressed during utricle hair cell regeneration
and closely parallels the expression of HES5. Likewise, the expression of ATOH1
is closely correlated with HEYL and the HLH inhibitory transcription factors ID1,
ID2, and ID4. We investigate the correlation between fibroblast growth factor
signaling and supporting cell proliferation and show that FGF20 inhibits
supporting cell proliferation. We also present an analysis of 212 differentially 
expressed transcription factor genes in the regenerative time course that fall
into nine distinct gene expression patterns, many of which correlate with
phenotypic events during regeneration and represent attractive candidates for
future analysis and manipulation of the regenerative program in sensory epithelia
and other vertebrate neuroepithelia.

Regeneration of auditory hair cells (HCs) is a promising approach to restore
hearing. Recent studies have demonstrated that induced pluripotent stem
cells/embryonic stem cells or supporting cells (SCs) adjacent to HCs can be
converted to adopt the HC fate. However, little is known about whether new HCs
are characteristic of outer or inner HCs. Here, we showed in vivo conversion of 2
subtypes of SCs, inner border cells (IBs) and inner phalangeal cells (IPhs), to
the inner HC (IHC) fate. This was achieved by ectopically activating Atoh1, a
transcription factor necessary for HC fate, in IBs/IPhs at birth. Atoh1+ IBs/IPhs
first turned on Pou4f3, another HC transcription factor, before expressing 8 HC
markers. The conversion rate gradually increased from ~ 2.4% at 1 week of age to 
~ 17.8% in adult. Interestingly, new HCs exhibited IHC characteristics such as
straight line-shaped stereociliary bundles, expression of Fgf8 and otoferlin, and
presence of larger outward currents than those of outer HCs. However, new HCs
lacked the terminal differentiation IHC marker vGlut3, exhibited reduced density 
of presynaptic Cbtp2 puncta that had little postsynaptic GluR2 specialization,
and displayed immature IHC outward currents. Our results demonstrate that the
conversion rate of IBs/IPhs in vivo by Atoh1 ectopic expression into the IHC fate
was higher and faster and the conversion was more complete than that of the 2
other SC subtypes underneath the outer HCs; however, these new IHCs are arrested 
before terminal differentiation. Thus, IBs/IPhs are good candidates to regenerate
IHCs in vivo.

Hmga2 protein belongs to the non-histone chromosomal high-mobility group (HMG)
protein family. HMG proteins have been shown to function as architectural
transcription regulators, facilitating enhanceosome formation on a variety of
mammalian promoters. Hmga2 are expressed at high levels in embryonic and
transformed cells. Terminally differentiated cells, however, have been reported
to express only minimal, if any, Hmga2. Our previous affymetrix array data showed
that Hmga2 is expressed in the developing and adult mammalian cochleas. However, 
the spatio-temporal expression pattern of Hmga2 in the murine cochlea remained
unknown. In this study, we report the expression of Hmga2 in developing and adult
cochleas using immunohistochemistry and quantitative real time PCR analysis.
Immunolabeling of Hmga2 in the embryonic, postnatal, and mature cochleas showed
broad Hmga2 expression in embryonic cochlea (E14.5) at the level of the
developing organ of Corti in differentiating hair cells, supporting cells, in
addition to immature cells in the GER and LER areas. By postnatal stage (P0-P3), 
Hmga2 is predominantly expressed in the hair and supporting cells, in addition to
cells in the LER area. By P12, Hmga2 immunolabeling is confined to the hair cells
and supporting cells. In the adult ear, Hmga2 expression is maintained in the
hair and supporting cell subtypes (i.e. Deiters' cells, Hensen cells, pillar
cells, inner phalangeal and border cells) in the cochlear epithelium. Using
quantitative real time PCR, we found a decrease in transcript level for Hmga2
comparable to other known inner ear developmental genes (Sox2, Atoh1, Jagged1 and
Hes5) in the cochlear epithelium of the adult relative to postnatal ears. These
data provide for the first time the tissue-specific expression and transcription 
level of Hmga2 during inner ear development and suggest its potential dual role
in early differentiation and maintenance of both hair and supporting cell
phenotypes.

Reaction-diffusion models have been used as a paradigm for describing the de novo
emergence of biological patterns such as stripes and spots. In many organisms,
these initial patterns are typically refined and elaborated over the subsequent
course of development. Here we study the formation of secondary hair follicle
patterns in the skin of developing mouse embryos. We used the expression of
sex-determining region Y box 2 to identify and distinguish the primary and
secondary hair follicles and to infer the spatiotemporal dynamics of the follicle
formation process. Quantitative analysis of the specific follicle patterns
observed reveals a simple geometrical rule governing the formation of secondary
follicles, and motivates an expansion-induction (EI) model in which new follicle 
formation is driven by the physical growth of the embryo. The EI model requires
only one diffusible morphogen and provides quantitative, accurate predictions on 
the relative positions and timing of secondary follicle formation, using only the
observed configuration of primary follicles as input. The same model accurately
describes the positions of additional follicles that emerge from skin explants
treated with an activator. Thus, the EI model provides a simple and robust
mechanism for predicting secondary space-filling patterns in growing embryos.

In mammals, the permanence of many forms of hearing loss is the result of the
inner ear's inability to replace lost sensory hair cells. Here, we apply a
differentiation strategy to guide human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into cells
of the otic lineage using chemically defined attached-substrate conditions. The
generation of human otic progenitor cells was dependent on fibroblast growth
factor (FGF) signaling, and protracted culture led to the upregulation of markers
indicative of differentiated inner ear sensory epithelia. Using a transgenic ESC 
reporter line based on a murine Atoh1 enhancer, we show that differentiated hair 
cell-like cells express multiple hair cell markers simultaneously. Hair cell-like
cells displayed protrusions reminiscent of stereociliary bundles, but failed to
fully mature into cells with typical hair cell cytoarchitecture. We conclude that
optimized defined conditions can be used in vitro to attain otic progenitor
specification and sensory cell differentiation.

Loss of cochlear hair cells in mammals is currently believed to be permanent,
resulting in hearing impairment that affects more than 10% of the population.
Here, we developed two genetic strategies to ablate neonatal mouse cochlear hair 
cells in vivo. Both Pou4f3(DTR/+) and Atoh1-CreER™; ROSA26(DTA/+) alleles allowed
selective and inducible hair cell ablation. After hair cell loss was induced at
birth, we observed spontaneous regeneration of hair cells. Fate-mapping
experiments demonstrated that neighboring supporting cells acquired a hair cell
fate, which increased in a basal to apical gradient, averaging over 120
regenerated hair cells per cochlea. The normally mitotically quiescent supporting
cells proliferated after hair cell ablation. Concurrent fate mapping and labeling
with mitotic tracers showed that regenerated hair cells were derived by both
mitotic regeneration and direct transdifferentiation. Over time, regenerated hair
cells followed a similar pattern of maturation to normal hair cell development,
including the expression of prestin, a terminal differentiation marker of outer
hair cells, although many new hair cells eventually died. Hair cell regeneration 
did not occur when ablation was induced at one week of age. Our findings
demonstrate that the neonatal mouse cochlea is capable of spontaneous hair cell
regeneration after damage in vivo. Thus, future studies on the neonatal cochlea
might shed light on the competence of supporting cells to regenerate hair cells
and on the factors that promote the survival of newly regenerated hair cells.

Shp2-dependent ERK signaling is essential for induction of Bergmann glia and
foliation of the cerebellum.

Folding of the cortex and the persistence of radial glia (RG)-like cells called
Bergmann glia (BG) are hallmarks of the mammalian cerebellum. Similar to basal RG
in the embryonic neocortex, BG maintain only basal processes and continuously
express neural stem cell markers. Past studies had focused on the function of BG 
in granule cell migration and how granule cell progenitors (GCP) regulate
cerebellar foliation. The molecular control of BG generation and its role in
cerebellar foliation are less understood. Here, we have analyzed the function of 
the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 in mice by deleting its gene Ptpn11 in the 
entire cerebellum or selectively in the GCP lineage. Deleting Ptpn11 in the
entire cerebellum by En1-cre blocks transformation of RG into BG but preserves
other major cerebellar cell types. In the absence of BG, inward invagination of
GCP persists but is uncoupled from the folding of the Purkinje cell layer and the
basement membrane, leading to disorganized lamination and an absence of
cerebellar folia. In contrast, removing Ptpn11 in the GCP lineage by Atoh1-cre
has no effect on cerebellar development, indicating that Shp2 is not cell
autonomously required in GCP. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Ptpn11 interacts
with Fgf8 and is essential for ERK activation in RG and nascent BG. Finally,
expressing constitutively active MEK1 rescues BG formation and cerebellar
foliation in Shp2-deficient cerebella. Our results demonstrate an essential role 
of Shp2 in BG specification via fibroblast growth factor/extracellular
signal-regulated protein kinase signaling, and reveal a crucial function of BG in
organizing cerebellar foliation.

Cells differentiate when transcription factors bind accessible cis-regulatory
elements to establish specific gene expression programs. In differentiating
embryonic stem cells, chromatin at lineage-restricted genes becomes sequentially 
accessible, probably by means of 'pioneer' transcription factor activity, but
tissues may use other strategies in vivo. Lateral inhibition is a pervasive
process in which one cell forces a different identity on its neighbours, and it
is unclear how chromatin in equipotent progenitors undergoing lateral inhibition 
quickly enables distinct, transiently reversible cell fates. Here we report the
chromatin and transcriptional underpinnings of differentiation in mouse small
intestine crypts, where notch signalling mediates lateral inhibition to assign
progenitor cells into absorptive or secretory lineages. Transcript profiles in
isolated LGR5(+) intestinal stem cells and secretory and absorptive progenitors
indicated that each cell population was distinct and the progenitors specified.
Nevertheless, secretory and absorptive progenitors showed comparable levels of
H3K4me2 and H3K27ac histone marks and DNase I hypersensitivity--signifying
accessible, permissive chromatin-at most of the same cis-elements. Enhancers
acting uniquely in progenitors were well demarcated in LGR5(+) intestinal stem
cells, revealing early priming of chromatin for divergent transcriptional
programs, and retained active marks well after lineages were specified. On this
chromatin background, ATOH1, a secretory-specific transcription factor, controls 
lateral inhibition through delta-like notch ligand genes and also drives the
expression of numerous secretory lineage genes. Depletion of ATOH1 from specified
secretory cells converted them into functional enterocytes, indicating prolonged 
responsiveness of marked enhancers to the presence or absence of a key
transcription factor. Thus, lateral inhibition and intestinal crypt lineage
plasticity involve interaction of a lineage-restricted transcription factor with 
broadly permissive chromatin established in multipotent stem cells.

Independently specified Atoh1 domains define novel developmental compartments in 
rhombomere 1.

The rhombic lip gives rise to neuronal populations that contribute to cerebellar,
proprioceptive and interoceptive networks. Cell production depends on the
expression of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Atoh1. In
rhombomere 1, Atoh1-positive cells give rise to both cerebellar neurons and
extra-cerebellar nuclei in ventral hindbrain. The origin of this cellular
diversity has previously been attributed to temporal signals rather than spatial 
patterning. Here, we show that in both chick and mouse the cerebellar Atoh1
precursor pool is partitioned into initially cryptic spatial domains that reflect
the activity of two different organisers: an isthmic Atoh1 domain, which gives
rise to isthmic nuclei, and the rhombic lip, which generates deep cerebellar
nuclei and granule cells. We use a combination of in vitro explant culture,
genetic fate mapping and gene overexpression and knockdown to explore the role of
isthmic signalling in patterning these domains. We show that an FGF-dependent
isthmic Atoh1 domain is the origin of distinct populations of Lhx9-positive
neurons in the extra-cerebellar isthmic nuclei. In the cerebellum, ectopic FGF
induces proliferation while blockade reduces the length of the cerebellar rhombic
lip. FGF signalling is not required for the specification of cerebellar cell
types from the rhombic lip and its upregulation inhibits their production. This
suggests that although the isthmus regulates the size of the cerebellar anlage,
the downregulation of isthmic FGF signals is required for induction of rhombic
lip-derived cerebellar neurons.

During normal cerebellar development, the remarkable expansion of granule cell
progenitors (GCPs) generates a population of granule neurons that outnumbers the 
total neuronal population of the cerebral cortex, and provides a model for
identifying signaling pathways that may be defective in medulloblastoma. While
many studies focus on identifying pathways that promote growth of GCPs, a
critical unanswered question concerns the identification of signaling pathways
that block mitogenic stimulation and induce early steps in differentiation. Here 
we identify WNT3 as a novel suppressor of GCP proliferation during cerebellar
development and an inhibitor of medulloblastoma growth in mice. WNT3, produced in
early postnatal cerebellum, inhibits GCP proliferation by down-regulating
pro-proliferative target genes of the mitogen Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and the bHLH
transcription factor Atoh1. WNT3 suppresses GCP growth through a non-canonical
Wnt signaling pathway, activating prototypic mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPKs), the Ras-dependent extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2)
and ERK5, instead of the classical ß-catenin pathway. Inhibition of MAPK activity
using a MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor reversed the inhibitory effect of WNT3 on GCP
proliferation. Importantly, WNT3 inhibits proliferation of medulloblastoma tumor 
growth in mouse models by a similar mechanism. Thus, the present study suggests a
novel role for WNT3 as a regulator of neurogenesis and repressor of neural
tumors.

Atoh1 is a transcription factor that regulates neural development in multiple
tissues and is conserved among species. Prior mouse models of Atoh1, though
effective and important in the evolution of our understanding of the gene, have
been limited by perinatal lethality. Here we describe a novel point mutation of
Atoh1 (designated Atoh1(trhl) ) underlying a phenotype of trembling gait and
hearing loss. Histology revealed inner ear hair cell loss and cerebellar atrophy.
Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) and Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission
(DPOAE) showed functional abnormalities in the ear. Normal lifespan and fecundity
of Atoh1(trhl) mice provide a complementary model to facilitate elucidation of
ATOH1 function in hearing,central nervous system and cancer biology.

It is generally believed that cerebellar granule neurons originate exclusively
from granule neuron precursors (GNPs) in the external germinal layer (EGL). Here 
we identified a rare population of neuronal progenitors in mouse developing
cerebellum that expresses Nestin. Although Nestin is widely considered a marker
for multipotent stem cells, these Nestin-expressing progenitors (NEPs) are
committed to the granule neuron lineage. Unlike conventional GNPs, which reside
in the outer EGL and proliferate extensively, NEPs reside in the deep part of the
EGL and are quiescent. Expression profiling revealed that NEPs are distinct from 
GNPs and, in particular, express markedly reduced levels of genes associated with
DNA repair. Consistent with this, upon aberrant activation of Sonic hedgehog
(Shh) signaling, NEPs exhibited more severe genomic instability and gave rise to 
tumors more efficiently than GNPs. These studies revealed a previously
unidentified progenitor for cerebellar granule neurons and a cell of origin for
medulloblastoma.

The ideal strategy for hair cell regeneration is promoting residual supporting
cell proliferation followed by induction of hair cell differentiation. In this
study, cultured neonatal mouse organs of Corti were treated with neomycin to
eliminate hair cells followed by incubation with recombined adenovirus expressing
Pax2 and/or Math1. Results showed that overexpression of Pax2 significantly
promoted proliferation of supporting cells. The number of BrdU<U+207A>/myosin VIIA<U+207A>
cells increased significantly in hair cell pre-existing region two weeks after
adenovirus infection in Ad-Pax2-IRES-Math1 group compared to Ad-Pax2 and Ad-Math1
groups. This indicated that cotransfection of Pax2 and Math1 induced supporting
cells to proliferate and differentiate into hair cells in situ. Most new hair
cells were labeled by FM1-43 suggesting they acquired certain function. The
results also suggest that inducing proliferating cells rather than quiescent
cells to differentiate into hair cells by forced expression of Math1 is feasible 
for mammalian hair cell regeneration.

Intestinal organoids are multicellular crypt-like structures that can be derived 
from adult intestinal stem cells (ISCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced
pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs). Here we show that intestinal organoids generated 
from mouse ESCs were enriched in ISCs and early progenitors. Treatment of these
organoids with a <U+03B3>-secretase inhibitor increased Math1 and decreased Hes1
expression, indicating Notch signaling regulates ISC differentiation in these
organoids. Lgr5 and Tert positive ISCs constituted approximately 10% and 20% of
the organoids. As found in native tissue, Lgr5 and Tert expressing cells resolved
into two discreet populations, which were stable over time. Intestinal organoids 
derived from cancer-prone Apc(Min/+) mice showed similar numbers of ISCs, but had
reduced Math1 expression, indicating a suppressed secretory cell differentiation 
potential (as found in intestinal tissue). Apc(Min/+) organoids were used to
screen epigenetically active compounds for those that increased Math1 expression 
and organoid differentiation (including HDAC inhibitors, Sirtuin (SIRT)
modulators and methyltransferase inhibitors). Broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitors
increased both Math1 and Muc2 expression, indicating an ability to promote the
suppressed secretory cell differentiation pathway. Other epigenetic compounds had
a diverse impact on cell differentiation, with a strong negative correlation
between those that activated the secretory marker Muc2 and those that activated
the absorptive cell marker Fabp2. These data show that ESC-derived intestinal
organoids can be derived in large numbers, contain distinct ISC types and can be 
used to screen for agents that promote cell differentiation through different
lineage pathways.

The tumor suppressor gene HIC1 (Hypermethylated In Cancer 1) is located in
17p13.3 a region frequently hypermethylated or deleted in tumors and in a
contiguous-gene syndrome, the Miller-Dieker syndrome which includes classical
lissencephaly (smooth brain) and severe developmental defects. HIC1 encodes a
transcriptional repressor involved in the regulation of growth control, DNA
damage response and cell migration properties. We previously demonstrated that
the membrane-associated G-protein-coupled receptors CXCR7, ADRB2 and the tyrosine
kinase receptor EphA2 are direct target genes of HIC1. Here we show that ectopic 
expression of HIC1 in U2OS and MDA-MB-231 cell lines decreases expression of the 
ApoER2 and VLDLR genes, encoding two canonical tyrosine kinase receptors for
Reelin. Conversely, knock-down of endogenous HIC1 in BJ-Tert normal human
fibroblasts through RNA interference results in the up-regulation of these two
Reelin receptors. Finally, through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in
BJ-Tert fibroblasts, we demonstrate that HIC1 is a direct transcriptional
repressor of ApoER2 and VLDLR. These data provide evidence that HIC1 is a new
regulator of the Reelin pathway which is essential for the proper migration of
neuronal precursors during the normal development of the cerebral cortex, of
Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and of mammary epithelial cells. Deregulation of
this pathway through HIC1 inactivation or deletion may contribute to its role in 
tumor promotion. Moreover, HIC1, through the direct transcriptional repression of
ATOH1 and the Reelin receptors ApoER2 and VLDLR, could play an essential role in 
normal cerebellar development.

The mammalian homolog of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor atonal-1
(Atoh1 or Math1) is required for development of cochlear hair cells that function
as the mechanosensory cells required for audition. Forced expression of Atoh1 in 
cochlear-supporting cells may provide a way to regenerate hair cells and provide 
for a therapy for hearing loss. Additionally, Atoh1 is an inhibitor of
proliferation and has further clinical applications in anticancer therapies. The 
goal of these experiments was to improve the method for Atoh1 expression by
engineering a genetic construct that may be used in future translational
applications. To address the poor control of Atoh1 expression in standard gene
expression systems where Atoh1 is expressed constitutively at abnormally elevated
levels, our aim was to engineer an inducible system whereby Atoh1 was upregulated
by an inducer and downregulated once the inducer was removed. A further aim was
to engineer a single genetic construct that allowed for conditional expression of
Atoh1 independent of secondary regulatory elements. Here we describe a
stand-alone genetic construct that utilizes the tamoxifen sensitivity of a
mutated estrogen receptor (ER) ligand-binding domain for the conditional
expression of Atoh1. The Atoh1-ER-DsRed construct is translated into an
ATOH1-ER-DSRED fusion protein that remains sequestered in the cytoplasm and
therefore rendered inactive because it cannot enter the nucleus to activate Atoh1
signaling pathways. However, application of 4-hydroxytamoxifen results in
translocation of the fusion protein to the nucleus, where it binds to the Atoh1
enhancer, upregulates transcription and translation of endogenous ATOH1 and
activates downstream Atoh1 signaling such as upregulation of the hair cell
protein MYOSIN 7A. Removal of tamoxifen reverses the upregulation of endogenous
Atoh1 signaling. This construct serves as an independent genetic construct that
allows for the conditional upregulation and downregulation of Atoh1, and may
prove useful for manipulating Atoh1 expression in vivo.

Gene therapy is a promising clinical solution to hearing loss. However suitable
gene carriers for the auditory system are currently unavailable. Given the unique
structure of the inner ear, the route of delivery and gene transfer efficiency
are still not optimal at present. This study presented a non-viral delivery
system of in vivo delivery of Atoh1 gene (a potentially therapeutic gene for
hearing loss) to rat cochlea. We treated polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers by
activating and modifying with Na-carboxymethyl-beta-cyclodextrins (CM-beta-CD) in
sequence. A novel gene carrier (CM-beta-CD modified activated PAMAM dendrimers,
CMAP) was then constructed. CMAP nanoparticles could bind pRK5-Atoh1-EGFP
plasmids to form vector-DNA complexes (dendriplexes) with a mean particle size of
132 +/- 20 nm and zeta potential of 31 +/- 3 mV. These dendriplexes were locally 
applied on the round window membrane and delivered to the inner ear by passive
gradient permeation. Results showed that the Atoh1 gene was successfully
transferred into the cells as indicated by the green fluorescence detected in the
inner ear. A relatively selective gene transfer with high efficiency was achieved
in the auditory hair cells but not much in other cell types in the cochlea.
Auditory brainstem response was determined seven days after inoculation,
indicating good tolerance. This approach may provide a novel tool for inner ear
gene therapy and initiate the applications of biomaterials to treat auditory
disorders.

Bicistronic gene transfer tools for delivery of miRNAs and protein coding
sequences.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a category of small RNAs that modulate levels of proteins 
via post-transcriptional inhibition. Currently, a standard strategy to
overexpress miRNAs is as mature miRNA duplexes, although this method is
cumbersome if multiple miRNAs need to be delivered. Many of these miRNAs are
found within introns and processed through the RNA polymerase II pathway. We have
designed a vector to exploit this naturally-occurring intronic pathway to deliver
the three members of the sensory-specific miR-183 family from an artificial
intron. In one version of the vector, the downstream exon encodes the reporter
(GFP) while another version encodes a fusion protein created between the
transcription factor Atoh1 and the hemaglutinin epitope, to distinguish it from
endogenous Atoh1. In vitro analysis shows that the miRNAs contained within the
artificial intron are processed and bind to their targets with specificity. The
genes downstream are successfully translated into protein and identifiable
through immunofluorescence. More importantly, Atoh1 is proven functional through 
in vitro assays. These results suggest that this cassette allows expression of
miRNAs and proteins simultaneously, which provides the opportunity for joint
delivery of specific translational repressors (miRNA) and possibly
transcriptional activators (transcription factors). This ability is attractive
for future gene therapy use.

Therapeutic concentrations of valproate but not amitriptyline increase
neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression in the human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line.

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a peptide found in the brain and autonomic nervous
system, which is associated with anxiety, depression, epilepsy, learning and
memory, sleep, obesity and circadian rhythms. NPY has recently gained much
attention as an endogenous antiepileptic and antidepressant agent, as drugs with 
antiepileptic and/or mood-stabilizing properties may exert their action by
increasing NPY concentrations, which in turn can reduce anxiety and depression
levels, dampen seizures or increase seizure threshold. We have used human
neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells to investigate the effect of valproate (VPA) and
amitriptyline (AMI) on NPY expression at therapeutic plasma concentrations of
0.6mM and 630nM, respectively. In addition, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate 
(TPA) known to differentiate SH-SY5Y cells into a neuronal phenotype and to
increase NPY expression through activation of protein kinase C (PKC) was applied 
as a positive control (16nM). Cell viability after drug treatment was tested with
a 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. NPY
expression was measured using immunofluorescence and quantitative RT-PCR
(qRT-PCR). Results from immunocytochemistry have shown NPY levels to be
significantly increased following a 72h but not 24h VPA treatment. A further
increase in expression was observed with simultaneous VPA and TPA treatment,
suggesting that the two agents may increase NPY expression through different
mechanisms. The increase in NPY mRNA by VPA and TPA was confirmed with qRT-PCR
after 72h. In contrast, AMI had no effect on NPY expression in SH-SY5Y cells.
Together, the data point to an elevation of human NPY mRNA and peptide levels by 
therapeutic concentrations of VPA following chronic treatment. Thus, upregulation
of NPY may have an impact in anti-cancer treatment of neuroblastomas with VPA,
and antagonizing hypothalamic NPY effects may help to ameliorate VPA-induced
weight gain and obesity without interfering with the desired central effects of
VPA.

Changes in ADF/destrin expression in the development of hair cells following
Atoh1-induced ectopic regeneration.

Jin K(1), Ren DD, Chi FL, Yang JM, Huang YB, Li W.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Otolaryngology, Otology and Skull Base Surgery;

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of actin depolymerizing
factor (ADF)/destrin and position changes of kinetosomes in the development of
hair cells following Atoh1-induced ectopic regeneration in the basilar membrane
of mice. We observed through immunofluorescence at various time-points the
expression of ADF/destrin and the specific kinetosome marker, <U+03B3>-tubulin, in hair 
cells following ectopic regeneration induced by adenovirus transfection,
overexpression of Atoh1 and in vitro culture. Changes of ADF/destrin distribution
and kinetosome position during in vitro culture of new hair cells [Myo7a(+)]
following Atoh1-induced ectopic regeneration are consistent with the changes in
ADF/destrin expression and the polar migration of kinetosomes in hair cells of
the cochlear sensory epithelium in normal development. ADF/destrin is involved in
the development of the auditory epithelium and the development and structural
rearrangement of ectopically regenerated hair cells in mammals. The kinetosomes
of hair cells following Atoh1-induced ectopic regeneration show positional
changes in vitro at different time-points.

and differentiation of mammalian cochlear hair cells.

Neural precursor cells of the central nervous system undergo successive temporal 
waves of terminal division, each of which is soon followed by the onset of cell
differentiation. The organ of Corti in the mammalian cochlea develops
differently, such that precursors at the apex are the first to exit from the cell
cycle but the last to begin differentiating as mechanosensory hair cells. Using a
tissue-specific knockout approach in mice, we show that this unique temporal
pattern of sensory cell development requires that the adjacent auditory (spiral) 
ganglion serve as a source of the signaling molecule Sonic hedgehog (Shh). In the
absence of this signaling, the cochlear duct is shortened, sensory hair cell
precursors exit from the cell cycle prematurely, and hair cell differentiation
closely follows cell cycle exit in a similar apical-to-basal direction. The
dynamic relationship between the restriction of Shh expression in the developing 
spiral ganglion and its proximity to regions of the growing cochlear duct
dictates the timing of terminal mitosis of hair cell precursors and their
subsequent differentiation.

Mammalian cochlear supporting cells remain quiescent at postnatal ages and
age-dependent changes in supporting cell proliferative capacity are evident.
Ectopic Atoh1 expression in neonatal supporting cells converts only a small
percentage of these cells into hair cell-like cells. Despite tremendous potential
for therapeutics, cellular reprogramming in the mammalian inner ear remains a
slow inefficient process that requires weeks, with most cells failing to
reprogram. Cellular reprogramming studies in other tissues have shown that
epigenetic inhibitors can significantly improve reprogramming efficiency. Very
little is known about epigenetic regulation in the mammalian inner ear, and
almost nothing is known about the histone modifications. Histone modifications
are vital for proper transcriptional regulation, and aberrant histone
modifications can cause defects in the regulation of genes required for normal
tissue development and maintenance. Our data indicate that cofactors of
repressive complexes such as NuRD and PRC2 are present in the neonatal organ of
Corti. These NuRD cofactors are present throughout most of the organ of Corti
from E18.5 until P4. By P6, these NuRD cofactors are mostly undetectable by
immunofluorescence and completely lost by P7, but are detectable again at P8 and 
continue to be present through P21. The PRC2 enzymatic subunit, EZH2 is also
highly present from E18.5 to P0 in the organ of Corti, but lost between P2 and
P4. However, EZH2 staining is evident again throughout the organ of Corti by P6
and persists through P21. Our data provide evidence that HDACs, DNA
methyltransferases, histone methyltransferases, and histone demethylases are
expressed postnatally within the organ of Corti, and may be targets for drug
inhibition to increase the capacity, speed, and efficiency of reprogramming a
supporting cell into a hair cell.

The Notch pathway is a cell signaling pathway determining initial specification
and subsequent cell fate in the inner ear. Previous studies have suggested that
new hair cells (HCs) can be regenerated in the inner ear by manipulating the
Notch pathway. In the present study, delivery of siRNA to Hes1 and Hes5 using a
transfection reagent or siRNA to Hes1 encapsulated within
poly(lactide-co-glycolide acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles increased HC numbers in
non-toxin treated organotypic cultures of cochleae and maculae of postnatal day 3
mouse pups. An increase in HCs was also observed in cultured cochleae and maculae
of mouse pups pre-conditioned with a HC toxin (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal or neomycin)
and then treated with the various siRNA formulations. Treating cochleae with
siRNA to Hes1 associated with a transfection reagent or siRNA to Hes1 delivered
by PLGA nanoparticles decreased Hes1 mRNA and up-regulated Atoh1 mRNA expression 
allowing supporting cells (SCs) to acquire a HC fate. Experiments using cochleae 
and maculae of p27(kip1)/-GFP transgenic mouse pups demonstrated that newly
generated HCs trans-differentiated from SCs. Furthermore, PLGA nanoparticles are 
non-toxic to inner ear tissue, readily taken up by cells within the tissue of
interest, and present a synthetic delivery system that is a safe alternative to
viral vectors. These results indicate that when delivered using a suitable
vehicle, Hes siRNAs are potential therapeutic molecules that may have the
capacity to regenerate new HCs in the inner ear and possibly restore human
hearing and balance function.

cells.

Math1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor homolog of the Drosophila
atonal gene, is considered to be a key factor for induction of sensory hair cells
(HCs) during development of the organ of Corti or cochlea. Although embryonic
stem (ES) cells are able to produce HC-like cells, the role of Math1 in induction
of those cells has not been thoroughly elucidated. In the present study, we
introduced Math1 into ES cells in order to achieve efficient generation of
HC-like cells. ES cells carrying Tet-inducible Math1, Math1-ES cells, were
generated using a Tet-On gene expression system. Embryoid bodies (EBs) formed in 
the absence of doxycycline (Dox) for 4 days were allowed to grow for an
additional 14 days in the dishes in the presence of 400<U+2009>µg/ml of Dox. At the end 
of those 14-day cultures, approximately 10% of the cells in EB outgrowths
expressed the HC-related markers myosin6, myosin7a, calretinin, a9AchR, and Brn3c
(also known as Pou4f3) and showed formation of stereocilia-like structures,
whereas few cells in EB outgrowths grown without Dox showed those markers.
Reporter assays of Math1-ES cells using a Brn3c-promoter plasmid demonstrated
positive regulation of Brn3c by Math1. Furthermore, such HC-related
marker-positive cells derived from Math1-ES cells were found to be incorporated
in the developing inner ear after transplantation into chick embryos. Math1-ES
cells are considered to be an efficient source of ES-derived HC-like cells, and
Math1 may be an important factor for induction of HC-like cells from
differentiating ES cells.

Atoh1 directs hair cell differentiation and survival in the late embryonic mouse 
inner ear.

Atoh1 function is required for the earliest stages of inner ear hair cell
development, which begins during the second week of gestation. Atoh1 expression
in developing hair cells continues until early postnatal ages, but the function
of this late expression is unknown. To test the role of continued Atoh1
expression in hair cell maturation we conditionally deleted the gene in the inner
ear at various embryonic and postnatal ages. In the organ of Corti, deletion of
Atoh1 at E15.5 led to the death of all hair cells. In contrast, deletion at E16.5
caused death only in apical regions, but abnormalities of stereocilia formation
were present throughout the cochlea. In the utricle, deletion at E14.5 or E16.5
did not cause cell death but led to decreased expression of myosin VIIa and
failure of stereocilia formation. Furthermore, we show that maintained expression
of Barhl1 and Gfi1, two transcription factors implicated in cochlear hair cell
survival, depends upon continued Atoh1 expression. However, maintained expression
of Pou4f3 and several hair cell-specific markers is independent of Atoh1
expression. These data reveal novel late roles for Atoh1 that are separable from 
its initial role in hair cell development.

Math1, retinoic acid, and TNF-a synergistically promote the differentiation of
mucous cells in mouse middle ear epithelial cells in vitro.

BACKGROUND: A key issue in otitis media (OM) is mucous cell metaplasia in the
middle ear mucosa, a condition for hyperproduction of mucus in the middle ear
mucosa and development of chronic OM. However, little is known about the driving 
force for the differentiation of mucous cells in OM.
METHODS: Mouse middle ear epithelial cells (mMEECs) were used in this study to
test whether Math1, a critical transcription factor for the development of mucous
cells in the intestine, synergizes with inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis
factor-a (TNF-a)) and other epithelial differentiation factors (retinoid acid
(RA)) to induce the differentiation of mMEECs into mucus-like cells in vitro.
Simultaneously, Math1 was transduced into the middle ear mucosa in order to
observe whether it induces mucous cell hyperplasia in vivo.
RESULTS: Math1 significantly increased the mucus cell numbers in the middle ear
mucosa of mice. Math1, in the presence of TNF-a and epithelial differentiation
factor RA, synergistically promoted the differentiation of mMEECs into mucus-like
cells through upregulation of mucins and their chaperones: trefoil factors in
vitro. RA treatment for 12<U+2009>h activated Math1, although RA alone had very limited 
effects on mucus-like cell differentiation.
CONCLUSION: Math1 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of OM by induction of
mucous cell differentiation in the presence of TNF-a and RA.

Lentivirus carrying the Atoh1 gene can infect Corti's organ and express a
hair-like cell surface marker in the supporting cell area. However, expression of
the gene carried by adenovirus is instantaneous, which undoubtedly limits its
clinical application. Lentivirus acts as a carrier that can stably and
continuously express genes. In this study, the cochlear structure and hearing
level were not affected, and Atoh1 gene carried by lentivirus promoted the
production of hair-like cells in the cochlear supporting cell area. This led to
expression of the hair-like cell surface marker myosin 7a 30 days after
lentivirus carrying Atoh1 was microinjected into the cochlear round window of
rats.

Conditional deletion of Atoh1 reveals distinct critical periods for survival and 
function of hair cells in the organ of Corti.

USA.

Atonal homolog1 (Atoh1) encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that is the
first transcription factor to be expressed in differentiating hair cells.
Previous work suggests that expression of Atoh1 in prosensory precursors is
necessary for the differentiation and survival of hair cells, but it is not clear
whether Atoh1 is required exclusively for these processes, or whether it
regulates other functions later during hair cell maturation. We used EGFP-tagged 
Atoh1 knock-in mice to demonstrate for the first time that Atoh1 protein is
expressed in hair cell precursors several days before the appearance of
differentiated markers, but not in the broad pattern expected of a proneural
gene. We conditionally deleted Atoh1 at different points in hair cell development
and observe a rapid onset of hair cell defects, suggesting that the Atoh1 protein
is unstable in differentiating hair cells and is necessary through an extended
phase of their differentiation. Conditional deletion of Atoh1 reveals multiple
functions in hair cell survival, maturation of stereociliary bundles, and
auditory function. We show the presence of distinct critical periods for Atoh1 in
each of these functions, suggesting that Atoh1 may be directly regulating many
aspects of hair cell function. Finally, we show that the supporting cell death
that accompanies loss of Atoh1 in hair cells is likely caused by the abortive
trans-differentiation of supporting cells into hair cells. Together our data
suggest that Atoh1 regulates multiple aspects of hair cell development and
function.

Sensory hair cells are exquisitely sensitive vertebrate mechanoreceptors that
mediate the senses of hearing and balance. Understanding the factors that
regulate the development of these cells is important, not only to increase our
understanding of ear development and its functional physiology but also to shed
light on how these cells may be replaced therapeutically. In this review, we
describe the signals and molecular mechanisms that initiate hair cell development
in vertebrates, with particular emphasis on the transcription factor Atoh1, which
is both necessary and sufficient for hair cell development. We then discuss
recent findings on how microRNAs may modulate the formation and maturation of
hair cells. Last, we review recent work on how hair cells are regenerated in many
vertebrate groups and the factors that conspire to prevent this regeneration in
mammals.

Transcription factors define the neuroanatomical organization of the medullary
reticular formation.

Gray PA(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Washington University School of
Medicine St. Louis, MO, USA.

The medullary reticular formation contains large populations of inadequately
described, excitatory interneurons that have been implicated in multiple
homeostatic behaviors including breathing, viserosensory processing, vascular
tone, and pain. Many hindbrain nuclei show a highly stereotyped pattern of
localization across vertebrates suggesting a strong underlying genetic
organization. Whether this is true for neurons within the reticular regions of
hindbrain is unknown. Hindbrain neurons are derived from distinct developmental
progenitor domains each of which expresses distinct patterns of transcription
factors (TFs). These neuronal populations have distinct characteristics such as
transmitter identity, migration, and connectivity suggesting developmentally
expressed TFs might identify unique subpopulations of neurons within the
reticular formation. A fate-mapping strategy using perinatal expression of
reporter genes within Atoh1, Dbx1, Lmx1b, and Ptf1a transgenic mice coupled with 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) were used to address
the developmental organization of a large subset of reticular formation
glutamatergic neurons. All hindbrain lineages have relatively large populations
that extend the entire length of the hindbrain. Importantly, the location of
neurons within each lineage was highly constrained. Lmx1b- and Dbx1- derived
populations were both present in partially overlapping stripes within the
reticular formation extending from dorsal to ventral brain. Within each lineage, 
distinct patterns of gene expression and organization were localized to specific 
hindbrain regions. Rostro-caudally sub-populations differ sequentially
corresponding to proposed pseudo-rhombomereic boundaries. Dorsal-ventrally,
sub-populations correspond to specific migratory positions. Together these data
suggests the reticular formation is organized by a highly stereotyped
developmental logic.

    EMBO J. 2013 Jul 17;32(14):1970-1.

While the Polycomb complex is known to regulate cell identity in ES cells, its
role in controlling tissue-specific stem cells is not well understood. Here we
show that removal of Ezh1 and Ezh2, key Polycomb subunits, from mouse skin
results in a marked change in fate determination in epidermal progenitor cells,
leading to an increase in the number of lineage-committed Merkel cells, a
specialized subtype of skin cells involved in mechanotransduction. By dissecting 
the genetic mechanism, we showed that the Polycomb complex restricts
differentiation of epidermal progenitor cells by repressing the transcription
factor Sox2. Ablation of Sox2 results in a dramatic loss of Merkel cells,
indicating that Sox2 is a critical regulator of Merkel cell specification. We
show that Sox2 directly activates Atoh1, the obligate regulator of Merkel cell
differentiation. Concordantly, ablation of Sox2 attenuated the Ezh1/2-null
phenotype, confirming the importance of Polycomb-mediated repression of Sox2 in
maintaining the epidermal progenitor cell state. Together, these findings define 
a novel regulatory network by which the Polycomb complex maintains the progenitor
cell state and governs differentiation in vivo.

Ectopic hair cell-like cell induction by Math1 mainly involves direct
transdifferentiation in neonatal mammalian cochlea.

Neck Surgery, 83 Fenyang Road, Shanghai 200031, China.

Math1, also known as Atoh1, is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that
plays a key role in hair cells (HCs) development. Previous studies have reported 
that Math1 gene transfer could induce the production of ectopic hair cell-like
cells both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we focused on the mechanism of ectopic
hair cell-like cellular differentiation from cells in the lateral epithelial
ridge (LER) of cochlea with a human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) vector encoding
both Math1 and the reporter gene EGFP. Within the Ad5-EGFP-Math1 infection,
hair-cell like cells could be detected in the LER. 5'-Bromo-2' deoxyuridine
(BrdU) incorporation test results at different time points suggested that LER
cells possessed high potential to proliferation, but they could not
transdifferentiate into hair cells spontaneously. Almost all of Math1 induced
hair cell-like cells were BrdU negative when BrdU incorporation occurred after
Math1 expression. In conclusion, Math1 induced hair cell-like cells from LER
cells mainly underwent direct trans-differentiation instead of mitosis of LER
cells or newly hair cell-like cells.

Paneth cells expand from newly created and preexisting cells during repair after 
doxorubicin-induced damage.

USA.

Paneth cell numbers increase following intestinal damage, but mechanisms driving 
this process are not understood. We hypothesized that the increase in Paneth cell
numbers is due to recruitment of cells from a preexisting pool of secretory
progenitors. Mice were given a single injection of doxorubicin (Dox), and
intestinal tissue was collected 0-168 h after treatment. Paneth, goblet, and
intermediate cells were counted and evaluated for cell morphology. Quantitative
RT-PCR was used to measure expression of various genes associated with Paneth
cell allocation and maturation. Paneth cells were birth dated using incorporation
of thymidine analogs given before or after Dox. Staining revealed "intermediate" 
cells, which were rarely observed in control crypts but increased significantly
in number 96 and 120 h after Dox treatment. Birth dating of intermediate cells 5 
days after Dox treatment revealed that 24% of these cells took up thymidine
analog given prior to Dox treatment and 36% took up thymidine analog given after 
Dox treatment. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated a significant increase in Spdef, 
Atoh1, Sox9, EphB3, Mist, Wnt5a, FGF-9, and FGF-18 mRNAs and a significant
decrease in Indian hedgehog mRNA. Expansion of the Paneth cell compartment after 
Dox treatment is due to generation of new cells and recruitment of cells from an 
existing pool. These cells express Paneth and goblet biomarkers and are found
only during repair. Expansion of these cells correlates temporally with reduced
Indian hedgehog and increased FGF and Wnt mRNA. These findings are significant,
as they provide a first step in understanding mechanisms of Paneth cell expansion
during mucosal repair.

Medulloblastoma is the most frequent type of embryonal tumour in the paediatric
population. The disease progression in patients with this tumour may be connected
with the presence of stem/tumour-initiating cells, but the precise source and
characteristics of such cells is still a subject of debate. Thus, we tried to
analyse biomarkers for which a connection with the presence of
stem/tumour-initiating cells was suggested. We evaluated the transcriptional
level of the ATOH1, FUT4, NGFR, OTX1, OTX2, PROM1 and SOX1 genes in 48 samples of
medulloblastoma and analysed their usefulness in the prediction of disease
outcome. The analyses showed a strong correlation of PROM1, ATOH1 and OTX1 gene
expression levels with the outcome (p = 0.2). On the basis of the multivariate
Cox regression analysis, we propose a three-gene model predicting risk of the
disease, calculated as follows: RS(risk score) =( 0:81 x PROM1) + (0:18 x OTX1) +
(0:02 x ATOH1). Survival analysis revealed a better outcome among standard-risk
patients, with a 5-year survival rate of 65 %, compared to the 40 % rate observed
among high-risk patients. The most promising advantage of such molecular analysis
consists in the identification of molecular markers influencing clinical
behaviour, which may in turn be useful in therapy optimization.

Continued expression of GATA3 is necessary for cochlear neurosensory development.

Duncan JS(1), Fritzsch B.

Author information:

America. jeremyduncan@jhmi.edu

Hair cells of the developing mammalian inner ear are progressively defined
through cell fate restriction. This process culminates in the expression of the
bHLH transcription factor Atoh1, which is necessary for differentiation of hair
cells, but not for their specification. Loss of several genes will disrupt ear
morphogenesis or arrest of neurosensory epithelia development. We previously
showed in null mutants that the loss of the transcription factor, Gata3, results 
specifically in the loss of all cochlear neurosensory development. Temporal
expression of Gata3 is broad from the otic placode stage through the postnatal
ear. It therefore remains unclear at which stage in development Gata3 exerts its 
effect. To better understand the stage specific effects of Gata3, we investigated
the role of Gata3 in cochlear neurosensory specification and differentiation
utilizing a LoxP targeted Gata3 line and two Cre lines. Foxg1(Cre):Gata3(f/f)
mice show recombination of Gata3 around E8.5 but continue to develop a cochlear
duct without differentiated hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons. qRT-PCR data 
show that Atoh1 was down-regulated but not absent in the duct whereas other hair 
cell specific genes such as Pou4f3 were completely absent. In addition, while
Sox2 levels were lower in the Foxg1(Cre):Gata3(f/f) cochlea, Eya1 levels remained
normal. We conclude that Eya1 is unable to fully upregulate Atoh1 or Pou4f3, and 
drive differentiation of hair cells without Gata3. Pax2-Cre:Gata3(f/f) mice show 
a delayed recombination of Gata3 in the ear relative to Foxg1(Cre):Gata3(f/f) .
These mice exhibited a cochlear duct containing patches of partially
differentiated hair cells and developed only few and incorrectly projecting
spiral ganglion neurons. Our conditional deletion studies reveal a major role of 
Gata3 in the signaling of prosensory genes and in the differentiation of cochlear
neurosenory cells. We suggest that Gata3 may act in combination with Eya1, Six1, 
and Sox2 in cochlear prosensory gene signaling.

The ectodermal dysplasias are a group of inherited autosomal dominant syndromes
associated with heterozygous mutations in the Tumor Protein p63 (TRP63) gene.
Here we show that, in addition to their epidermal pathology, a proportion of
these patients have distinct levels of deafness. Accordingly, p63 null mouse
embryos show marked cochlea abnormalities, and the transactivating isoform of p63
(TAp63) protein is normally found in the organ of Corti. TAp63 transactivates
hairy and enhancer of split 5 (Hes5) and atonal homolog 1 (Atoh1), components of 
the Notch pathway, known to be involved in cochlear neuroepithelial development. 
Strikingly, p63 null mice show morphological defects of the organ of Corti, with 
supernumerary hair cells, as also reported for Hes5 null mice. This phenotype is 
related to loss of a differentiation property of TAp63 and not to loss of its
proapoptotic function, because cochleas in mice lacking the critical Bcl-2
homology domain (BH-3) inducers of p53- and p63-mediated apoptosis--Puma, Noxa,
or both--are normal. Collectively, these data demonstrate that TAp63, acting via 
the Notch pathway, is crucial for the development of the organ of Corti,
providing a molecular explanation for the sensorineural deafness in ectodermal
dysplasia patients with TRP63 mutations.

The role of Atonal transcription factors in the development of mechanosensitive
cells.

Jarman AP(1), Groves AK.

of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom. andrew.jarman@ed.ac.uk

Mechanosensation is an evolutionarily ancient sensory modality seen in all main
animal groups. Mechanosensation can be mediated by sensory neurons or by
dedicated receptor cells that form synapses with sensory neurons. Evidence over
the last 15-20 years suggests that both classes of mechanosensory cells can be
specified by the atonal class of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors. In
this review we discuss recent work addressing how atonal factors specify
mechanosensitive cells in vertebrates and invertebrates, and how the redeployment
of these factors underlies the regeneration of mechanosensitive cells in some
vertebrate groups.

Mucus and adiponectin deficiency: role in chronic inflammation-induced colon
cancer.

PURPOSE: This study aims to define the role of adiponectin (APN) in preventing
goblet cell apoptosis and in differentiation of epithelial cells to goblet cell
lineage resulting in greater mucus production and hence greater protection from
chronic inflammation-induced colon cancer (CICC).
METHODS: Six- to eight-week-old male APNKO and C57BL/6 (WT) mice were randomly
distributed to three treatment groups: DSS, DMH, DSS<U+2009>+<U+2009>DMH and control. Chronic
inflammation was induced in DSS and DSS<U+2009>+<U+2009>DMH group by administrating 2 % DSS in 
drinking water for 5 days followed by 5 days of normal drinking water and this
constitutes one DSS cycle. Three cycles of DSS were administered to induce
chronic inflammation. Cancer was induced in both APNKO and WT mice in DMH and
DSS<U+2009>+<U+2009>DMH groups by intraperitoneal injections of DMH (20 mg/kg body weight) once
for DSS<U+2009>+<U+2009>DMH group and once per week for 12 weeks for DMH group. On day 129, the
colon tissue was dissected for mucus thickness measurements and for genomic
studies. HT29-C1.16E and Ls174T cells were used for several genomic and siRNA
studies.
RESULTS: APNKO mice have more tumors and tumor area in DSS<U+2009>+<U+2009>DMH group than WT
mice. APN deficiency downregulated goblet to epithelial cell ratio and enhanced
the colonic mucosal erosion with reduced mucus thickness. APN increases Muc2
production with no affect on Muc1 production. APN abated goblet cell apoptosis,
while APN deficiency reduced epithelial to goblet cell differentiation.
CONCLUSION: APN may be involved in reducing the severity of CICC by preventing
goblet cell apoptosis and increasing epithelial to goblet cell differentiation.

Common partner Smad-independent canonical bone morphogenetic protein signaling in
the specification process of the anterior rhombic lip during cerebellum
development.

Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling is critical for cerebellum
development. However, the details of receptor regulated-Smad (R-Smad) and common 
partner Smad (Co-Smad, or Smad4) involvement are unclear. Here, we report that
cerebellum-specific double conditional inactivation of Smad1 and Smad5 (Smad1/5) 
results in cerebellar hypoplasia, reduced granule cell numbers, and disorganized 
Purkinje neuron migration during embryonic development. However, single
conditional inactivation of either Smad1 or Smad5 did not result in cerebellar
abnormalities. Surprisingly, conditional inactivation of Smad4, which is
considered to be the central mediator of canonical BMP-Smad signaling, resulted
only in very mild cerebellar defects. Conditional inactivation of Smad1/5 led to 
developmental defects in the anterior rhombic lip (ARL), as shown by reduced cell
proliferation and loss of Pax6 and Atoh1 expression. These defects subsequently
caused the loss of the nuclear transitory zone and a region of the deep
cerebellar nuclei. The normal maturation of the remaining granule cell precursors
in the external granular layer (EGL) suggests Smad1/5 signaling is required for
the specification process in ARL but not for the subsequent EGL development. Our 
results demonstrate functional redundancy for Smad1 and Smad5 but functional
discrepancy between Smad1/5 and Smad4 during cerebellum development.

Neuronal stem cells have been described in the post-natal cochlear nucleus
recently. The aim of the study was to analyse the neurogenic potential in the
cochlear nucleus from the early post-natal days until adulthood. Cochlear nuclei 
from Sprague-Dawley rats from post-natal day P3 up to P40 were examined.
Neurosphere assays showed persistent neurosphere formation from the early
post-natal days until adulthood. The numbers of generated neurospheres were fewer
in older ages. Neurospheres were smaller, but displayed the same pattern of
neuronal stem cell markers. The markers GFAP, MBP and ß-III Tubulin showed
differentiation of dissociated cells from the neurospheres in all cells of the
neuronal lineage. BrdU incorporation could be detected, in an age-dependent
decrease, in whole-mount experiments of the cochlear nucleus on all examined
days. BrdU co-labelled with Atoh1 and ß-III Tubulin. In addition, gene expression
and cellular distribution studies of the neuronal stem cell markers displayed an 
age-dependent reduction in both quantity and numbers. The presented results
display a possible neurogenic potential until adulthood in the cochlear nucleus
by in vitro and in vivo experiments. The fact that this potential is highest at a
critical period of development reveals possible functional importance for the
development of the cochlear nucleus and the auditory function. The persistent
neurogenic potential displayed until adulthood could be a neurogenic niche in the
adult cochlear nucleus, which might be used for potential therapeutic strategies.

siRNA targeting Hes5 augments hair cell regeneration in aminoglycoside-damaged

Notch signaling is active during the development of mosaic epithelial sheets and 
during their turnover and regeneration. After the loss of hair cells in the
mosaic sheet of the vestibular sensory epithelium, new hair cells can be
spontaneously generated by transdifferentiation of supporting cells. This
regenerative process involves downregulation of the Hes5 gene and is known to be 
limited and incomplete, especially when the lesion is severe. Here, we test
whether further downregulation of Hes5 gene accomplished by the use of siRNA
after a severe lesion induced by an aminoglycoside in the mouse utricle can
enhance the transdifferentiation of supporting cells and lead to the increased
production of new hair cells. We demonstrate that Hes5 levels in the utricle
decreased after the application of siRNA and that the number of hair cells in
these utricles was significantly larger than following control treatment. The
data suggest that siRNA technology may be useful for inducing repair and
regeneration in the inner ear and that the Notch signaling pathway is a
potentially useful target for specific gene expression inhibition.

BACKGROUND: The human colon harbours a plethora of bacteria known to broadly
impact on mucosal metabolism and function and thought to be involved in
inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis and colon cancer development. In this
report, we investigated the effect of colonic bacteria on epithelial cell
differentiation factors in vitro and in vivo. As key transcription factors we
focused on Hes1, known to direct towards an absorptive cell fate, Hath1 and KLF4,
which govern goblet cell.
METHODS: Expression of the transcription factors Hes1, Hath1 and KLF4, the mucins
Muc1 and Muc2 and the defensin HBD2 were measured by real-time PCR in LS174T
cells following incubation with several heat-inactivated E. coli strains,
including the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917+/- flagellin, Lactobacilli and
Bifidobacteria. For protein detection Western blot experiments and chamber-slide 
immunostaining were performed. Finally, mRNA and protein expression of these
factors was evaluated in the colon of germfree vs. specific pathogen free vs.
conventionalized mice and colonic goblet cells were counted.
RESULTS: Expression of Hes1 and Hath1, and to a minor degree also of KLF4, was
reduced by E. coli K-12 and E. coli Nissle 1917. In contrast, Muc1 and HBD2
expression were significantly enhanced, independent of the Notch signalling
pathway. Probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 regulated Hes1, Hath1, Muc1 and HBD2
through flagellin. In vivo experiments confirmed the observed in vitro effects of
bacteria by a diminished colonic expression of Hath1 and KLF4 in specific
pathogen free and conventionalized mice as compared to germ free mice whereas the
number of goblet cells was unchanged in these mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal bacteria influence the intestinal epithelial
differentiation factors Hes1, Hath1 and KLF4, as well as Muc1 and HBD2, in vitro 
and in vivo. The induction of Muc1 and HBD2 seems to be triggered directly by
bacteria and not by Notch.

Hath1, a bHLH transcription factor negatively regulated by the
<U+03B3>-secretase-dependent Notch pathway, is required for intestinal secretory cell
differentiation. Our aim was fourfold: 1) determine whether Hath1 is able to
alter the phenotype of colon cancer cells that are committed to a differentiated 
phenotype, 2) determine whether the Hath1-dependent alteration of differentiation
is coupled to a restriction of anchorage-dependent growth, 3) decipher the
respective roles of three putative tumor suppressor genes Hath1, MUC2 and P27kip1
in this coupling and, 4) examine how our findings translate to primary tumors.
Human colon carcinoma cell lines that differentiate along a mucin secreting
(MUC2/MUC5AC) and/or enterocytic (DPPIV) lineages were maintained on inserts with
or without a <U+03B3>-secretase inhibitor (DBZ). Then the cells were detached and their 
ability to survive/proliferate in the absence of substratum was assessed.
<U+03B3>-secretase inhibition led to a Hath1-mediated preferential induction of MUC2
over MUC5AC, without DPPIV modification, in association with a decrease in
anchorage-independent growth. While P27kip1 silencing relieved the cells from the
Hath1-induced decrease of anchorage-independent growth, MUC2 silencing did not
modify this parameter. Hath1 ectopic expression in the Hath1 negative enterocytic
Caco2 cells led to a decreased anchorage-independent growth in a
P27kip1-independent manner. In cultured primary human colon carcinomas, Hath1 was
up-regulated in 7 out of 10 tumors upon DBZ treatment. Parallel MUC2
up-regulation occurred in 4 (4/7) and P27kip1 in only 2 (2/7) tumors.
Interestingly, the response patterns of primary tumors to DBZ fitted with the
hierarchical model of divergent signalling derived from our findings on cell
lines.

cells induces inner ear cell phenotype.

Hearing is one of our main sensory systems and having a hearing disorder can have
a significant impact in an individual's quality of life. Sensory neural hearing
loss (SNHL) is the most common form of hearing loss; it results from the
degeneration of inner ear sensory hair cells and auditory neurons in the cochlea,
cells that are terminally differentiated. Stem cell-and gene delivery-based
strategies provide an opportunity for the replacement of these cells. In recent
years, there has been an increasing interest in gene delivery to mesenchymal stem
cells. In this study, we evaluated the potential of human umbilical cord
mesenchymal stromal cells (hUCMSCs) as a possible source for regenerating inner
ear hair cells. The expression of Atoh1 induced the differentiation of hUCMSCs
into cells that resembled inner ear hair cells morphologically and
immunocytochemically, evidenced by the expression of hair cell-specific markers. 
The results demonstrated for the first time that hUCMSCs can differentiate into
hair cell-like cells, thus introducing a new potential tissue engineering and
cell transplantation approach for the treatment of hearing loss.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Expression of the SAM pointed domain containing ETS
transcription factor (SPDEF or prostate-derived ETS factor) is regulated by Atoh1
and is required for the differentiation of goblet and Paneth cells. SPDEF has
been reported to suppress the development of breast, prostate, and colon tumors. 
We analyzed levels of SPDEF in colorectal tumor samples from patients and its
tumor-suppressive functions in mouse models of colorectal cancer (CRC).
METHODS: We analyzed levels of SPDEF messenger RNA and protein in more than 500
human CRC samples and more than 80 nontumor controls. Spdef(-/-)and wild-type
mice (controls) were either bred with Apc(Min/+) mice, or given azoxymethane
(AOM) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), or 1,2-dimethylhydrazine and DSS, to
induce colorectal tumors. Expression of Spdef also was induced transiently by
administration of tetracycline to Spdef(dox-intestine) mice with established
tumors, induced by the combination of AOM and DSS or by breeding with Apc(Min/+) 
mice. Colon tissues were collected and analyzed for tumor number, size, grade,
and for cell proliferation and apoptosis. We also analyzed the effects of SPDEF
expression in HCT116 and SW480 human CRC cells.
RESULTS: In colorectal tumors from patients, loss of SPDEF was observed in
approximately 85% of tumors and correlated with progression from normal tissue,
to adenoma, to adenocarcinoma. Spdef(-/-); Apc(Min/+) mice developed
approximately 3-fold more colon tumors than Spdef(+/+); Apc(Min/+) mice.
Likewise, Spdef(-/-) mice developed approximately 3-fold more colon tumors than
Spdef(+/+) mice after administration of AOM and DSS. After administration of
1,2-dimethylhydrazine and DSS, invasive carcinomas were observed exclusively in
Spdef(-/-) mice. Conversely, expression of SPDEF was sufficient to promote
cell-cycle exit in cells of established adenomas from Spdef(dox-intestine);
Apc(Min/+) mice and in Spdef(dox-intestine) mice after administration of AOM +
DSS. SPDEF inhibited the expression of ß-catenin-target genes in mouse colon
tumors, and interacted with ß-catenin to block its transcriptional activity in
CRC cell lines, resulting in lower levels of cyclin D1 and c-MYC.
CONCLUSIONS: SPDEF is a colon tumor suppressor and a candidate therapeutic target
for colon adenomas and adenocarcinoma.

intestinal epithelium resulting in a loss of distal intestinal motility.

The vertebrate intestinal epithelium is renewed continuously from stem cells at
the base of the crypt in mammals or base of the fold in fish over the life of the
organism. As stem cells divide, newly formed epithelial cells make an initial
choice between a secretory or enterocyte fate. This choice has previously been
demonstrated to involve Notch signaling as well as Atonal and Her transcription
factors in both embryogenesis and adults. Here, we demonstrate that in contrast
to the atoh1 in mammals, ascl1a is responsible for formation of secretory cells
in zebrafish. ascl1a-/- embryos lack all intestinal epithelial secretory cells
and instead differentiate into enterocytes. ascl1a-/- embryos also fail to induce
intestinal epithelial expression of deltaD suggesting that ascl1a plays a role in
initiation of Notch signaling. Inhibition of Notch signaling increases the number
of ascl1a and deltaD expressing intestinal epithelial cells as well as the number
of developing secretory cells during two specific time periods: between 30 and
34hpf and again between 64 and 74hpf. Loss of enteroendocrine products results in
loss of anterograde motility in ascl1a-/- embryos. 5HT produced by
enterochromaffin cells is critical in motility and secretion within the
intestine. We find that addition of exogenous 5HT to ascl1a-/- embryos at near
physiological levels (measured by differential pulse voltammetry) induce
anterograde motility at similar levels to wild type velocity, distance, and
frequency. Removal or doubling the concentration of 5HT in WT embryos does not
significantly affect anterograde motility, suggesting that the loss of additional
enteroendocrine products in ascl1a-/- embryos also contributes to intestinal
motility. Thus, zebrafish intestinal epithelial cells appear to have a common
secretory progenitor from which all subtypes form. Loss of enteroendocrine cells 
reveals the critical need for enteroendocrine products in maintenance of normal
intestinal motility.

Notch signaling has a fundamental role in stem cell maintenance and in cell fate 
choice in the intestine of different species. Canonically, Notch signaling
represses the expression of transcription factors of the achaete-scute like
(ASCL) or atonal related protein (ARP) families. Identifying the ARP/ASCL genes
expressed in the gastrointestinal tract is essential to build the regulatory
cascade controlling the differentiation of gastrointestinal progenitors into the 
different intestinal cell types. The expression of the ARP/ASCL factors was
analyzed in zebrafish to identify, among all the ARP/ASCL factors found in the
zebrafish genome, those expressed in the gastrointestinal tract. ascl1a was found
to be the earliest factor detected in the intestine. Loss-of-function analyses
using the pia/ascl1a mutant, revealed that ascl1a is crucial for the
differentiation of all secretory cells. Furthermore, we identify a battery of
transcription factors expressed during secretory cell differentiation and
downstream of ascl1a. Finally, we show that the repression of secretory cell fate
by Notch signaling is mediated by the inhibition of ascl1a expression. In
conclusion, this work identifies Ascl1a as a key regulator of the secretory cell 
lineage in the zebrafish intestine, playing the same role as Atoh1 in the mouse
intestine. This highlights the diversity in the ARP/ASCL family members acting as
cell fate determinants downstream from Notch signaling.

The transcription factor Atonal homolog 1 (Atoh1) plays crucial roles in the
differentiation of intestinal epithelium cells. Although we have reported that
the Atoh1 protein was degraded in colon cancer by aberrant Wnt signaling, a
recent study has indicated that the Atoh1 protein is expressed in mucinous colon 
cancer (MC) and signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC). However, the roles of the
Atoh1 protein in MC are unknown. To mimic MC, a mutated Atoh1 protein was stably 
expressed in undifferentiated colon cancer cells. Microarray analysis revealed
the acquisition of not only the differentiated cell form, but also malignant
potential by Atoh1 protein stabilization. In particular, Atoh1 enhanced Wnt
signaling, resulting in the induction of Lgr5 as a representative stem cell
marker with the enrichment of cancer stem cells. Moreover, the fluorescent
ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator system with time-lapse live imaging
demonstrated cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase by Atoh1 protein stabilization.
In conclusion, the Atoh1 protein regulates malignant potential rather than the
differentiation phenotype of MC, suggesting the mechanism by which MC and SRCC
are more malignant than non-mucinous adenocarcinoma.

The Atoh1-lineage gives rise to hair cells and supporting cells within the
mammalian cochlea.

The organ of Corti, located within the mammalian cochlea, contains a precise
mosaic of hair cells (HC) and supporting cells (SC), the patterning of which is
critical for auditory function. Progenitors of HCs and SCs are found in the same 
post-mitotic region of the cochlear duct during early stages of cochlear
development, and both HCs and SCs are absent in mice lacking the transcription
factor Atoh1. Based on existing data, Atoh1 is thought to be the earliest
determinant of HC fate, and to have a cell-autonomous role in HC differentiation,
but the lineage of Atoh1-positive cells within the cochlear duct remains unclear.
To address this issue, we used an inducible Atoh1(Cre<U+204E>PR) allele to permanently
mark Atoh1-expressing cells at different developmental time points. We found that
up to 30% of cells from the Atoh1-lineage develop as SCs, and that the number of 
Atoh1-positive SCs decreases both spatially and temporally in a pattern
consistent with ongoing commitment. Modulation of Notch signaling, necessary for 
formation of the HC-SC mosaic, changes the percentage of cells from the
Atoh1-lineage that develop as either HCs or SCs. The HC-SC ratio is also affected
by morphogenesis of the cochlea, as inhibiting the outgrowth of the cochlear duct
increases the number of Atoh1-lineage cells that develop as SCs. Our results
demonstrate that the Atoh1-lineage is established early in cochlear development, 
but also show that expression of Atoh1 does not absolutely result in commitment
to a HC fate.

Hearing loss due to damage to auditory hair cells is normally irreversible
because mammalian hair cells do not regenerate. Here, we show that new hair cells
can be induced and can cause partial recovery of hearing in ears damaged by noise
trauma, when Notch signaling is inhibited by a <U+03B3>-secretase inhibitor selected for
potency in stimulating hair cell differentiation from inner ear stem cells in
vitro. Hair cell generation resulted from an increase in the level of bHLH
transcription factor Atoh1 in response to inhibition of Notch signaling. In vivo 
prospective labeling of Sox2-expressing cells with a Cre-lox system unambiguously
demonstrated that hair cell generation resulted from transdifferentiation of
supporting cells. Manipulating cell fate of cochlear sensory cells in vivo by
pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling is thus a potential therapeutic
approach to the treatment of deafness.

Kruppel-like factor 5 controls villus formation and initiation of
cytodifferentiation in the embryonic intestinal epithelium.

Kruppel-like factor 5 (Klf5) is a transcription factor expressed by embryonic
endodermal progenitors that form the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. A Klf5
floxed allele was efficiently deleted from the intestinal epithelium by a Cre
transgene under control of the Shh promoter resulting in the inhibition of villus
morphogenesis and epithelial differentiation. Although proliferation of the
intestinal epithelium was maintained, the expression of Elf3, Ppar<U+03B3>, Atoh1,
Ascl2, Neurog3, Hnf4a, Cdx1, and other genes associated with epithelial cell
differentiation was inhibited in the Klf5-deficient intestines. At E18.5,
Klf5(<U+0394>/<U+0394>) fetuses lacked the apical brush border characteristic of enterocytes,
and a loss of goblet and enteroendocrine cells was observed. The failure to form 
villi was not attributable to the absence of HH or PDGF signaling, known
mediators of this developmental process. Klf5-deletion blocked the decrease in
FoxA1 and Sox9 expression that accompanies normal villus morphogenesis. KLF5
directly inhibited activity of the FoxA1 promoter, and in turn FOXA1 inhibited
Elf3 gene expression in vitro, linking the observed loss of Elf3 with the
persistent expression of FoxA1 observed in Klf5-deficient mice. Genetic network
analysis identified KLF5 as a key transcription factor regulating intestinal cell
differentiation and cell adhesion. These studies indicate a novel requirement for
KLF5 to initiate morphogenesis of the early endoderm into a compartmentalized
intestinal epithelium comprised of villi and terminally differentiated cells.

granule neuron lineage and promotes differentiation into mature granule neurons.

Directing differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to specific neuronal
subtype is critical for modeling disease pathology in vitro. An attractive means 
of action would be to combine regulatory differentiation factors and extrinsic
inductive signals added to the culture medium. In this study, we have generated
mature cerebellar granule neurons by combining a temporally controlled transient 
expression of Math1, a master gene in granule neuron differentiation, with
inductive extrinsic factors involved in cerebellar development. Using a
Tetracyclin-On transactivation system, we overexpressed Math1 at various stages
of ESCs differentiation and found that the yield of progenitors was considerably 
increased when Math1 was induced during embryonic body stage. Math1 triggered
expression of Mbh1 and Mbh2, two target genes directly involved in granule neuron
precursor formation and strong expression of early cerebellar territory markers
En1 and NeuroD1. Three weeks after induction, we observed a decrease in the
number of glial cells and an increase in that of neurons albeit still immature.
Combining Math1 induction with extrinsic factors specifically increased the
number of neurons that expressed Pde1c, Zic1, and GABAa6R characteristic of
mature granule neurons, formed "T-shaped" axons typical of granule neurons, and
generated synaptic contacts and action potentials in vitro. Finally, in vivo
implantation of Math1-induced progenitors into young adult mice resulted in cell 
migration and settling of newly generated neurons in the cerebellum. These
results show that conditional induction of Math1 drives ESCs toward the
cerebellar fate and indicate that acting on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors 
is a powerful means to modulate ESCs differentiation and maturation into a
specific neuronal lineage.

Beyond generalized hair cells: molecular cues for hair cell types.

Sciences, 143 BB, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.

Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (TFs) are crucial for inner
ear neurosensory development. The proneural TF Atoh1 regulates the
differentiation of hair cells (HCs) whereas Neurog1 and Neurod1 regulate
specification and differentiation of neurons, respectively, but also affect HC
development. Expression of Delta and Jagged ligands in nascent HCs and Notch
receptors in supporting cells induce supporting cell differentiation through the 
regulation of neurogenic bHLH TFs (such as Hes1, Hes5) and suppression of limited
Atoh1 expression. In sensorineural hearing loss, HCs are lost followed by
supporting cells and progressive degeneration of neurons, at least in rodents.
Regaining complete hearing may require reconstituting the organ of Corti from
scratch, including the two types of HCs, inner and outer hair cells with the
precise sorting of two types of afferent (type I and II) and efferent (lateral
and medial olivo-cochlear) innervation. We review effects of bHLH TF dosage and
their cross-regulation to differentiate HC types in the organ of Corti. We
categorize findings of specific gene expressions in HCs: 1. as markers without
meaning for the regeneration task, 2. as stabilizers who are needed to maintain
or complete differentiation, and 3. as decision-making genes, expressed and
acting early enough to be useful in this process. Only one TF has been
characterized that fits the last aspect: Atoh1. We propose that temporal and
intensity variations of Atoh1 are naturally modulated to differentiate specific
types of HCs. Importantly, the molecular means to modify the Atoh1 expression are
at least partially understood and can be readily implemented in the attempts to
regenerate specific types of HCs.

BACKGROUND: Hearing restoration through hair cell regeneration will require
revealing the dynamic interactions between proliferation and differentiation
during development to avoid the limited viability of regenerated hair cells.
Pax2-Cre N-Myc conditional knockout (CKO) mice highlighted the need of N-Myc for 
proper neurosensory development and possible redundancy with L-Myc. The
late-onset hair cell death in the absence of early N-Myc expression could be due 
to mis-regulation of genes necessary for neurosensory formation and maintenance, 
such as Neurod1, Atoh1, Pou4f3, and Barhl1.
RESULTS: Pax2-Cre N-Myc L-Myc double CKO mice show that proliferation and
differentiation are linked together through Myc and in the absence of both Mycs, 
altered proliferation and differentiation result in morphologically abnormal
ears. In particular, the organ of Corti apex is re-patterned into a
vestibular-like organization and the base is truncated and fused with the
saccule.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that therapeutic approaches to restore hair
cells must take into account a dynamic interaction of proliferation and
differentiation regulation of basic Helix-Loop-Helix transcription factors in
attempts to stably replace lost cochlear hair cells. In addition, our data
indicate that Myc is an integral component of the evolutionary transformation
process that resulted in the organ of Corti development.

Notch in the intestine: regulation of homeostasis and pathogenesis.

Noah TK(1), Shroyer NF.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Gastroenterology, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center,
Cincinnati, Ohio 45229, USA.

The small and large intestines are tubular organs composed of several tissue
types. The columnar epithelium that lines the inner surface of the intestines
distinguishes the digestive physiology of each region of the intestine and
consists of several distinct cell types that are rapidly and continually renewed 
by intestinal stem cells that reside near the base of the crypts of Lieberkühn.
Notch signaling controls the fate of intestinal stem cells by regulating the
expression of Hes genes and by repressing Atoh1. Alternate models of Notch
pathway control of cell fate determination are presented. Roles for Notch
signaling in development of the intestine, including mesenchymal and neural
cells, are discussed. The oncogenic activities of Notch in colorectal cancer, as 
well as the tumor suppressive activities of Atoh1, are reviewed. Therapeutic
targeting of the Notch pathway in colorectal cancers is discussed, along with
potential caveats.

14-3-3 proteins regulate a cell-intrinsic switch from sonic hedgehog-mediated
commissural axon attraction to repulsion after midline crossing.

Axons must switch responsiveness to guidance cues during development for correct 
pathfinding. Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) attracts spinal cord commissural axons
ventrally toward the floorplate. We show that after crossing the floorplate,
commissural axons switch their response to Shh from attraction to repulsion, so
that they are repelled anteriorly by a posterior-high/anterior-low Shh gradient
along the longitudinal axis. This switch is recapitulated in vitro with
dissociated commissural neurons as they age, indicating that the switch is
intrinsic and time dependent. 14-3-3 protein inhibition converted Shh-mediated
repulsion of aged dissociated neurons to attraction and prevented the correct
anterior turn of postcrossing commissural axons in vivo, an effect mediated
through PKA. Conversely, overexpression of 14-3-3 proteins was sufficient to
drive the switch from Shh-mediated attraction to repulsion both in vitro and
in vivo. Therefore, we identify a 14-3-3 protein-dependent mechanism for a
cell-intrinsic temporal switch in the polarity of axon turning responses.

AIM: Mouse mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can generate sensory neurons and produce
inner ear hair cell-like cells. An equivalent source from humans is highly
desirable, given their potential application in patient-specific regenerative
therapies for deafness. In this study, we explored the ability of human MSCs
(hMSCs) to differentiate into otic lineages.
MATERIALS & METHODS: hMSCs were exposed to culture media conditioned by human
fetal auditory stem cells.
RESULTS: Conditioned media induced the expression of otic progenitor markers
PAX8, PAX2, GATA3 and SOX2. After 4 weeks, cells coexpressed ATOH1, MYO7A and
POU4F3 (indicators of hair cell lineage) or neuronal markers NEUROG1, POU4F1 and 
NEFH. Inhibition of WNT signaling prevented differentiation into otic
progenitors, while WNT activation partially phenocopied results seen with the
conditioned media.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that hMSCs can be driven to express key genes
found in the otic lineages and thereby promotes their status as candidates for
regenerative therapies for deafness.

Transcription factors (TFs) participate during various processes throughout inner
ear development such as induction, morphogenesis and determination of cell fate
and differentiation. The analysis of mouse mutants has been essential to define
the requirement of different members of TF families during these processes. Next 
to their roles during normal development TFs have also been tested for their
capacity to induce differentiation or reprogram cells upon misexpression.
Recently the capacity of TFs to transdifferentiate easily accessible cells such
as fibroblasts to highly specialized cell types has opened a new pathway for
regenerative therapies. In this review the influence of TFs acting during
different phases and processes of inner ear development will be summarized. A
special focus will be given to TFs with a potential to reprogram or
transdifferentiate cells to sensory cell types of the inner ear such as hair
cells or neurons and thus may form part of future protocols directed to generate 
replacement cells in a clinical context.

Sox2 regulation of hair cell development: incoherence makes sense.

Neves J(1), Vachkov I, Giraldez F.

Author information: 
(1)Developmental Biology Unit, CEXS, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Parc de Recerca
Biomèdica de Barcelona (PRBB), Barcelona, Spain.

The function of the inner ear relies on different specialized cell types: hair
cells, supporting cells and otic neurons. During development, these cell types
are generated from the neurosensory domain of the otic placode with a stereotyped
spatial and temporal pattern. We discuss here the role played by Sox2 in the
establishment of the neurosensory competence at early stages of inner ear
development, and how this resolves in the sequential generation of neurons and
hair cells. Sox2 is expressed in the neurosensory domain of the otic placode and 
it is necessary and sufficient for hair cell development. The prosensory function
of Sox2 relies on its ability to directly bind Atoh1 regulatory regions and
activate its expression. This function is likely mediated through the interaction
with partner factors, some of which are just starting to be disclosed. However,
the regulation of proneural genes by Sox2 is seemingly contradictory, because it 
also inhibits the function of Atoh1 and hence the differentiation of hair cells. 
This is because Sox2 triggers an incoherent feed forward loop by which in
parallel to the activation of Atoh1, Sox2 also induces inhibitory factors that
counteract its function. As a result, neurosensory competence is established in
the early otic placode but hair cell differentiation procrastinated. More
generally, this suggests that cell diversification may arise from the selective
de-repression of an initial multicompetent state.

A failure in the control of proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursor 
cells (GCPs), located in the external granular layer (EGL) of the cerebellum,
gives rise to medulloblastoma. To investigate the process of neoplastic
transformation of GCPs, we generated a new medulloblastoma model by crossing
Patched1 heterozygous mice, which develop medulloblastomas with low frequency,
with mice lacking the Tis21 gene. Overexpression of Tis21 is known to inhibit
proliferation and trigger differentiation of GCPs; its expression decreases in
human medulloblastomas. Double-knock-out mice show a striking increase in the
frequency of medulloblastomas and hyperplastic EGL lesions, formed by
preneoplastic GCPs. Tis21 deletion does not affect the proliferation of GCPs but 
inhibits their differentiation and, chiefly, their intrinsic ability to migrate
outside the EGL. This defect of migration may represent an important step in
medulloblastoma formation, as GCPs, remaining longer in the EGL proliferative
niche, may become more prone to transformation. By genome-wide analysis, we
identified the chemokine Cxcl3 as a target of Tis21. Cxcl3 is downregulated in
Tis21-null GCPs of EGL and lesions; addition of Cxcl3 to cerebellar slices
rescues the defective migration of Tis21-null GCPs and, remarkably, reduces the
area of hyperplastic lesions. As Tis21 activates Cxcl3 transcription, our results
suggest that Tis21 induces migration of GCPs through Cxcl3, which may represent a
novel target for medulloblastoma therapy.

cells.

HYPOTHESIS: Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be converted into hair
cell-like cells by transdetermination.
BACKGROUND: Given the fundamental role sensory hair cells play in sound detection
and the irreversibility of their loss in mammals, much research has focused on
developing methods to generate new hair cells as a means of treating permanent
hearing loss. Although MSCs can differentiate into multiple cell lineages, no
efficient means of reprogramming them into sensory hair cells exists. Earlier
work has shown that the transcription factor Atoh1 is necessary for early
development of hair cells, but it is not clear whether Atoh1 can be used to
convert MSCs into hair cells.
METHODS: Clonal MSC cell lines were established and reprogrammed into hair
cell-like cells by a combination of protein transfer, adenoviral based gene
transfer, and co-culture with neurons. During transdetermination, inner ear
molecular markers were analyzed using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction, and cell structures were examined using immunocytochemistry.
RESULTS: Atoh1 overexpression in MSCs failed to convert MSCs into hair cell-like 
cells, suggesting that the ability of Atoh1 to induce hair cell differentiation
is context dependent. Because Atoh1 overexpression successfully transforms
VOT-E36 cells into hair cell-like cells, we modified the cell context of MSCs by 
performing a total protein transfer from VOT-E36 cells before overexpressing
Atoh1. The modified MSCs were transformed into hair cell-like cells and attracted
contacts from spiral ganglion neurons in a co-culture model.
CONCLUSION: We established a new procedure, consisting of VOT-E36 protein
transfer, Atoh1 overexpression, and co-culture with spiral ganglion neurons,
which can transform MSCs into hair cell-like cells.

Hair cell replacement in adult mouse utricles after targeted ablation of hair
cells with diphtheria toxin.

We developed a transgenic mouse to permit conditional and selective ablation of
hair cells in the adult mouse utricle by inserting the human diphtheria toxin
receptor (DTR) gene into the Pou4f3 gene, which encodes a hair cell-specific
transcription factor. In adult wild-type mice, administration of diphtheria toxin
(DT) caused no significant hair cell loss. In adult Pou4f3(+/DTR) mice, DT
treatment reduced hair cell numbers to 6% of normal by 14 days post-DT. Remaining
hair cells were located primarily in the lateral extrastriola. Over time, hair
cell numbers increased in these regions, reaching 17% of untreated Pou4f3(+/DTR) 
mice by 60 days post-DT. Replacement hair cells were morphologically distinct,
with multiple cytoplasmic processes, and displayed evidence for active
mechanotransduction channels and synapses characteristic of type II hair cells.
Three lines of evidence suggest replacement hair cells were derived via direct
(nonmitotic) transdifferentiation of supporting cells: new hair cells did not
incorporate BrdU, supporting cells upregulated the pro-hair cell gene Atoh1, and 
supporting cell numbers decreased over time. This study introduces a new method
for efficient conditional hair cell ablation in adult mouse utricles and
demonstrates that hair cells are spontaneously regenerated in vivo in regions
where there may be ongoing hair cell turnover.

Ric-8a, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for heterotrimeric G proteins,
regulates bergmann glia-basement membrane adhesion during cerebellar foliation.

Ma S(1), Kwon HJ, Huang Z.

The cerebellum consists of an intricate array of lobules that arises during the
process of foliation. Foliation not only increases surface area, but may also
facilitate organization of cerebellar neural circuitry. Defects in cerebellar
foliation are associated with a number of diseases. Yet, little is known about
how foliation, a process involving large-scale and simultaneous movement of
several different cell types, is coordinated by cell-cell signaling at the
molecular level. Here we show that Ric-8a, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor
in the G-protein-coupled receptor pathway, is specifically required in Bergmann
glia during cerebellar foliation. We find that ric-8a mutation in mice results in
disorganized Bergmann glial scaffolding, defective granule cell migration, and
disrupted Purkinje cell positioning. These abnormalities result from primary
defects in Bergmann glia since mutations in granule cells do not show similar
effects. They first arise during late embryogenesis, at the onset of foliation,
when ric-8a mutant Bergmann glia fail to maintain adhesion to the basement
membrane specifically at emerging fissures. This suggests that Ric-8a is
essential for the enhanced Bergmann glia-basement membrane adhesion required for 
fissure formation. Indeed, we find that ric-8a-deficient cerebellar glia show
decreased affinity for basement membrane components. We also find that weakening 
Bergmann glia-basement membrane interaction by ß1 integrin deletion results in a 
similar phenotype. These results thus reveal a novel role of Ric-8a in modulating
Bergmann glia-basement membrane adhesion during foliation, and provide new
insights into the signaling pathways that coordinate cellular movement during
cerebellar morphogenesis.

Bmi1 overexpression in the cerebellar granule cell lineage of mice affects cell
proliferation and survival without initiating medulloblastoma formation.

BMI1 is a potent inducer of neural stem cell self-renewal and neural progenitor
cell proliferation during development and in adult tissue homeostasis. It is
overexpressed in numerous human cancers - including medulloblastomas, in which
its functional role is unclear. We generated transgenic mouse lines with targeted
overexpression of Bmi1 in the cerebellar granule cell lineage, a cell type that
has been shown to act as a cell of origin for medulloblastomas. Overexpression of
Bmi1 in granule cell progenitors (GCPs) led to a decrease in cerebellar size due 
to decreased GCP proliferation and repression of the expression of cyclin genes, 
whereas Bmi1 overexpression in postmitotic granule cells improved cell survival
in response to stress by altering the expression of genes in the mitochondrial
cell death pathway and of Myc and Lef-1. Although no medulloblastomas developed
in ageing cohorts of transgenic mice, crosses with Trp53(-/-) mice resulted in a 
low incidence of medulloblastoma formation. Furthermore, analysis of a large
collection of primary human medulloblastomas revealed that tumours with a
BMI1(high) TP53(low) molecular profile are significantly enriched in Group 4
human medulloblastomas. Our data suggest that different levels and timing of Bmi1
overexpression yield distinct cellular outcomes within the same cellular lineage.
Importantly, Bmi1 overexpression at the GCP stage does not induce tumour
formation, suggesting that BMI1 overexpression in GCP-derived human
medulloblastomas probably occurs during later stages of oncogenesis and might
serve to enhance tumour cell survival.

Atonal homolog 1 (Atoh1) is crucial to the differentiation of many cell types and
participates in tumorigenesis and progression. This study investigated the role
of Atoh1 in lung cancer development and its correlation with key members of the
Wnt pathway. We used immunohistochemistry to examine the expressions of Atoh1,
ß-catenin, Axin, chibby, and Disabled-2 (Dab2) in 118 samples of lung cancer. We 
also detected the cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of Atoh1 in lung cancer
tissues using western blot. Atoh1 nuclear expression was negatively correlated
with differentiation level (p = 0.004) and primary tumor stage (p = 0.044) of
lung cancer. Nuclear Atoh1 expression was positively correlated with nuclear
expression of chibby (p < 0.001) and Dab2 (p < 0.001). Cytoplasmic Atoh1
expression was positively correlated with the cytoplasmic expression of Axin (p =
0.028), chibby (p < 0.001), and Dab2 (p < 0.001). We conclude that the nuclear
expression of Atoh1 was inversely correlated with the differentiation and primary
tumor stage of lung cancers. The expression and localization of Atoh1 correlated 
with Axin, chibby, or Dab2. Atoh1 may be a potential therapeutic target for the
inhibition of growth and progression of lung cancers.

Regeneration of stereocilia of hair cells by forced Atoh1 expression in the adult
mammalian cochlea.

The hallmark of mechanosensory hair cells is the stereocilia, where mechanical
stimuli are converted into electrical signals. These delicate stereocilia are
susceptible to acoustic trauma and ototoxic drugs. While hair cells in lower
vertebrates and the mammalian vestibular system can spontaneously regenerate lost
stereocilia, mammalian cochlear hair cells no longer retain this capability. We
explored the possibility of regenerating stereocilia in the noise-deafened guinea
pig cochlea by cochlear inoculation of a viral vector carrying Atoh1, a gene
critical for hair cell differentiation. Exposure to simulated gunfire resulted in
a 60-70 dB hearing loss and extensive damage and loss of stereocilia bundles of
both inner and outer hair cells along the entire cochlear length. However, most
injured hair cells remained in the organ of Corti for up to 10 days after the
trauma. A viral vector carrying an EGFP-labeled Atoh1 gene was inoculated into
the cochlea through the round window on the seventh day after noise exposure.
Auditory brainstem response measured one month after inoculation showed that
hearing thresholds were substantially improved. Scanning electron microscopy
revealed that the damaged/lost stereocilia bundles were repaired or regenerated
after Atoh1 treatment, suggesting that Atoh1 was able to induce
repair/regeneration of the damaged or lost stereocilia. Therefore, our studies
revealed a new role of Atoh1 as a gene critical for promoting repair/regeneration
of stereocilia and maintaining injured hair cells in the adult mammal cochlea.
Atoh1-based gene therapy, therefore, has the potential to treat noise-induced
hearing loss if the treatment is carried out before hair cells die.

N-Myc and L-Myc are essential for hair cell formation but not maintenance.

Sensorineural hearing loss results from damage to the hair cells of the organ of 
Corti and is irreversible in mammals. While hair cell regeneration may prove to
be the ideal therapy after hearing loss, prevention of initial hair cell loss
could provide even more benefit at a lower cost. Previous studies have shown that
the deletion of Atoh1 results in embryonic loss of hair cells while the absence
of Barhl1, Gfi1, and Pou4f3 leads to the progressive loss of hair cells in
newborn mice. We recently reported that in the early embryonic absence of N-Myc
(using Pax2-Cre), hair cells in the organ of Corti develop and remain until at
least seven days after birth, with subsequent progressive loss. Thus, N-Myc plays
a role in hair cell viability; however, it is unclear if this is due to its early
expression in hair cell precursors and throughout the growing otocyst as it
functions through proliferation or its late expression exclusively in
differentiated hair cells. Furthermore, the related family member L-Myc is mostly
co-expressed in the ear, including in differentiated hair cells, but its function
has not been studied and could be partially redundant to N-Myc. To test for a
long-term function of the Mycs in differentiated hair cells, we generated nine
unique genotypes knocking out N-Myc and/or L-Myc after initial formation of hair 
cells using the well-characterized Atoh1-Cre. We tested functionality of the
auditory and vestibular systems at both P21 and four months of age and under the 
administration of the ototoxic drug cisplatin. We conclude that neither N-Myc nor
L-Myc is likely to play important roles in long-term hair cell maintenance.
Therefore, it is likely that the late-onset loss of hair cells resulting from
early deletion of the Mycs leads to an unsustainable developmental defect.

TFE2 and GATA3 enhance induction of POU4F3 and myosin VIIa positive cells in
nonsensory cochlear epithelium by ATOH1.

Masuda M(1), Pak K, Chavez E, Ryan AF.

Author information: 
(1)Departments of Surgery/Otolaryngology, La Jolla, CA 92093-0666, USA.

Transcription factors (TFs) can regulate different sets of genes to determine
specific cell types by means of combinatorial codes. We previously identified
closely-spaced TF binding motifs located 8.2-8.5 kb 5' to the ATG of the murine
Pou4f3 gene, a gene required for late hair cell (HC) differentiation and
survival. These motifs, 100% conserved among four mammalian species, include a
cluster of E-boxes preferred by TCF3/ATOH1 heterodimers as well as motifs for
GATA factors and SP1. We hypothesized that these factors might interact to
regulate the Pou4f3 gene and possibly induce a HC phenotype in non-sensory cells 
of the cochlea. Cochlear sensory epithelium explants were prepared from postnatal
day 1.5 transgenic mice in which expression of GFP is driven by 8.5 kb of Pou4f3 
5' genomic DNA (Pou4f3/GFP). Electroporation was used to transfect cells of the
greater epithelial ridge with multiple plasmids encoding human ATOH1 (hATOH1),
hTCF3 (also known as E2A or TEF2), hGATA3, and hSP1. hATOH1 or hTCF3 alone
induced Pou4f3/GFP cells but hGATA3 and hSP1 did not. hATOH1 but not hTCF3
induced conversion of greater epithelial ridge cells into Pou4f3/GFP and myosin
VIIa double-positive cells. Transfection of hATOH1 in combination with hTCF3 or
hGATA3 induced 2-3X more Pou4f3/GFP cells, and similarly enhanced Pou4f3/GFP and 
myosin VIIa double-positive cells, when compared to hATOH1 alone. Triple or
quadruple TF combinations were generally not more effective than double TF
combinations except in the middle turn, where co-transfection of hATOH1, hE2A,
and hGATA3 was more effective than hATOH1 plus either hTCF3 or hGATA3. The
results demonstrate that TFs can cooperate in regulation of the Pou4f3 gene and
in the induction of at least one other element of a HC phenotype. Our data
further indicate that combinations of TFs can be more effective than individual
TFs in the inner ear.

Atoh1 governs the migration of postmitotic neurons that shape respiratory
effectiveness at birth and chemoresponsiveness in adulthood.

Hindbrain neuronal networks serving respiratory, proprioceptive, and arousal
functions share a developmental requirement for the bHLH transcription factor
Atoh1. Loss of Atoh1 in mice results in respiratory failure and neonatal
lethality; however, the neuronal identity and mechanism by which Atoh1-dependent 
cells sustain newborn breathing remains unknown. We uncovered that selective loss
of Atoh1 from the postmitotic retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) neurons results in
severely impaired inspiratory rhythm and pronounced neonatal death. Mice that
escape neonatal death develop abnormal chemoresponsiveness as adults.
Interestingly, the expression of Atoh1 in the RTN neurons is not required for
their specification or maintenance, but is important for their proper
localization and to establish essential connections with the preBötzinger Complex
(preBötC). These results provide insights into the genetic regulation of neonatal
breathing and shed light on the labile sites that might contribute to sudden
death in newborn infants and altered chemoresponsiveness in adults.

Redundant sources of Wnt regulate intestinal stem cells and promote formation of 
Paneth cells.

University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.

Comment in
    Gastroenterology. 2012 Dec;143(6):1426-30.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wnt signaling regulates multiple aspects of intestinal
physiology, including stem cell maintenance. Paneth cells support stem cells by
secreting Wnt, but little is known about the exact sources and primary functions 
of individual Wnt family members.
METHODS: We analyzed intestinal tissues and cultured epithelial cells from adult 
mice with conditional deletion of Wnt3 (Vil-CreERT2;Wnt3fl/fl mice). We also
analyzed intestinal tissues and cells from Atoh1 mutant mice, which lack
secretory cells.
RESULTS: Unexpectedly, Wnt3 was dispensable for maintenance of intestinal stem
cells in mice, indicating a redundancy of Wnt signals. By contrast, cultured
crypt organoids required Paneth cell-derived Wnt3. Addition of exogenous Wnt, or 
coculture with mesenchymal cells, restored growth of Vil-CreERT2;Wnt3fl/fl crypt 
organoids. Intestinal organoids from Atoh1 mutant mice did not grow or form
Paneth cells; addition of Wnt3 allowed growth in the absence of Paneth cells. Wnt
signaling had a synergistic effect with the Lgr4/5 ligand R-spondin to induce
formation of Paneth cells. Mosaic expression of Wnt3 in organoids using a
retroviral vector promoted differentiation of Paneth cells in a cell-autonomous
manner.
CONCLUSIONS: Wnt is part of a signaling loop that affects homeostasis of
intestinal stem and Paneth cells in mice. Wnt3 signaling is required for growth
and development of organoid cultures, whereas nonepithelial Wnt signals could
provide a secondary physiological source of Wnt.

OBJECTIVE: To explore whether the Ad5-atoh1/EGFP could transdifferent the
supporting cells into the new hair cells in young adult guinea pigs cochlea in
vivo.
METHOD: Twelve healthy pigmented guinea pigs weighted 200-250 g were included in 
this experiment. 5 ul of Ad5-E1/E3 defected-atoh1/EGFP were infused into the
scala media through a hole made on the lateral wall of the cochlea. Six of the 12
animal were killed 2 weeks after the infusion operation. The others were killed 4
weeks after the operation. The whole mount of the basal membranes were directly
observed under the fluorescence microscope for the expression of the EGFP
(enhance green fluorescent protein) or for the expression of the hair
cellspecific marker and nuclear after staining with myosin VIIa rabbit polyclonal
antibody and Dapi dye.
RESULT: New cells with big nuclear, ellipse body and expressed with EGFP were
found in the region near to the outmost row of the outer hair cells in 2 animal 2
weeks after the infusion. Moreover there were 3 animals with specific morphologic
new cells in the location where ever been located by the outer hair cells and the
region as 2 weeks animals 4 weeks after the infusion. Those cells were stained by
myosin VIIa antibody.
CONCLUSION: Atoh1 gene could transdifferent some supporting cells in the basal
membrane into hair cell like cells in young adult guinea pigs in vivo. These
supporting cells locate in the region of outer hair cells and the basal membrane 
which do not belong to the region of outer hair cells.

The interfascicular trigeminal nucleus: a precerebellar nucleus in the mouse
defined by retrograde neuronal tracing and genetic fate mapping.

Fu Y(1), Tvrdik P, Makki N, Machold R, Paxinos G, Watson C.

Author information: 
(1)Neuroscience Research Australia, Randwick, New South Wales 2031, Australia.

We have found a previously unreported precerebellar nucleus located among the
emerging fibers of the motor root of the trigeminal nerve in the mouse, which we 
have called the interfascicular trigeminal nucleus (IF5). This nucleus had
previously been named the tensor tympani part of the motor trigeminal nucleus
(5TT) in rodent brain atlases, because it was thought to be a subset of small
motor neurons of the motor trigeminal nucleus innervating the tensor tympani
muscle. However, following injection of retrograde tracer in the cerebellum, the 
labeled neurons in IF5 were found to be choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)
negative, indicating that they are not motor neurons. The cells of IF5 are
strongly labeled in mice from Wnt1Cre and Atoh1 CreER lineage fate mapping, in
common with the major precerebellar nuclei that arise from the rhombic lip and
that issue mossy fibers. Analysis of sections from mouse Hoxa3, Hoxb1, and Egr2
Cre labeled lineages shows that the neurons of IF5 arise from rhombomeres caudal 
to rhombomere 4, most likely from rhombomeres 6-8. We conclude that IF5 is a
significant precerebellar nucleus in the mouse that shares developmental gene
expression characteristics with mossy fiber precerebellar nuclei that arise from 
the caudal rhombic lip.

Genome-wide microarray comparison reveals downstream genes of Pax6 in the
developing mouse cerebellum.

The Pax6 transcription factor is expressed in cerebellar granule cells and when
mutated, as in the Sey/Sey mouse, produces granule cells with disturbed survival 
and migration and with defects in neurite extension. The impact of Pax6 on other 
genes in the context of cerebellar development has not been identified. In this
study, we performed transcriptome comparisons between wildtype and Pax6-null
whole cerebellar tissue at embryonic day (E) 13.5, 15.5 and 18.5 using Affymetrix
arrays (U74Av2). Statistical analyses identified 136 differentially regulated
transcripts (FDR 0.05, 1.2-fold change cutoff) over time in Pax6-null cerebellar 
tissue. In parallel we examined the Math1-null granuloprival cerebellum and
identified 228 down-regulated transcripts (FDR 0.05, 1.2-fold change cutoff). The
intersection of these two microarray datasets produced a total of 21
differentially regulated transcripts. For a subset of the identified transcripts,
we used qRT-PCR to validate the microarray data and demonstrated the expression
in the rhombic lip lineage and differential expression in Pax6-null cerebellum
with in situ hybridisation analysis. The candidate genes identified in this way
represent direct or indirect Pax6-downstream genes involved in cerebellar
development.

Auditory hair cells are surrounded on their basolateral aspects by supporting
cells, and these two cell types together constitute the sensory epithelium of the
organ of Corti, which is the hearing apparatus of the ear. We show here that
Lgr5, a marker for adult stem cells, was expressed in a subset of supporting
cells in the newborn and adult murine cochlea. Lgr5-expressing supporting cells, 
sorted by flow cytometry and cultured in a single-cell suspension, compared with 
unsorted cells, displayed an enhanced capacity for self-renewing neurosphere
formation in response to Wnt and were converted to hair cells at a higher
(>10-fold) rate. The greater differentiation of hair cells in the neurosphere
assay showed that Lgr5-positive cells had the capacity to act as cochlear
progenitor cells, and lineage tracing confirmed that Lgr5-expressing cells
accounted for the cells that formed neurospheres and differentiated to hair
cells. The responsiveness to Wnt of cells with a capacity for division and
sensory cell formation suggests a potential route to new hair cell generation in 
the adult cochlea.

Chronic gastritis associated with Helicobacter pylori is a leading cause of
gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM), which arises from abnormal cell
differentiation of the epithelium in the gastric mucosa. However, the mechanisms 
involved in H. pylori-mediated IM remain elusive. The aim of our study was to
explore the effects and the underlying mechanisms of H. pylori on the abnormal
expression of Hath1 and Sox2 and to reveal its relationship to the development of
gastric IM. We found that Hath1 and Sox2 were overexpressed in gastric IM tissue.
Hath1 expression was up-regulated, whereas Sox2 expression, which was independent
of the CagA virulence factor, was down-regulated in gastric epithelial cells and 
coincided with increased IL-6 and IL-8 levels in the culture media. Stimulation
with H. pylori-related cytokine IL-8, but not IL-6 or IL-1ß, was induced by Hath1
expression in the gastric epithelial cells. Although IL-8 and IL-6 levels
correlated with STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription)
phosphorylation before and after H. pylori eradication in the gastric mucosa,
only the blocking of IL-8-induced STAT3 activation using AG490 or STAT3-targeting
RNA interference altered Hath1 expression. Additionally, we found that H. pylori 
down-regulated Hes1, which is a direct downstream target gene of Notch signaling 
and a repressor of Hath1 expression. These findings suggest that H. pylori
induced inflammation up-regulate Hath1 expression via interleukin-8/STAT3 (IL-8) 
phosphorylation while suppressing Hes1, which provides a novel molecular
connection between a H. pylori infection and intestinal metaplasia.

Reconstructing a functional organ of Corti is the ultimate target towards curing 
hearing loss. Despite the impressive technical gains made over the last few
years, many complications remain ahead for the two main restoration avenues: in
vitro transformation of pluripotent cells into hair cell-like cells and
adenovirus-mediated gene therapy. Most notably, both approaches require a more
complete understanding of the molecular networks that ensure specific cell types 
form in the correct places to allow proper function of the restored organ of
Corti. Important to this understanding are the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
transcription factors (TFs) that are highly diverse and serve to increase
functional complexity but their evolutionary implementation in the inner ear
neurosensory development is less conspicuous. To this end, we review the
evolutionary and developmentally dynamic interactions of the three bHLH TFs that 
have been identified as the main players in neurosensory evolution and
development, Neurog1, Neurod1 and Atoh1. These three TFs belong to the
neurogenin/atonal family and evolved from a molecular precursor that likely
regulated single sensory cell development in the ectoderm of metazoan ancestors
but are now also expressed in other parts of the body, including the brain. They 
interact extensively via intracellular and intercellular cross-regulation to
establish the two main neurosensory cell types of the ear, the hair cells and
sensory neurons. Furthermore, the level and duration of their expression affect
the specification of hair cell subtypes (inner hair cells vs. outer hair cells). 
We propose that appropriate manipulation of these TFs through their characterized
binding sites may offer a solution by itself, or in conjunction with the two
other approaches currently pursued by others, to restore the organ of Corti.

CONCLUSION: In the current study, hair cells of vestibular terminal organs in
rats were completely eliminated with trans-scala vestibuli injection of neomycin,
and then the Math1 gene was transferred. It was shown that type I vestibular hair
cells were regenerated and synapses were formed.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify the cell type of the
regenerated vestibular hair cells and relative innervation and synaptic linkage
after hair cells of vestibular terminal organs in rats were completely
eliminated.
METHODS: Neomycin injection was used to eliminate all the vestibular terminal
organs, and then the animals were treated with an injection of Ad-Math1-EGFP in
the scala vestibuli of the cochlea.
RESULTS: Math1 gene transfer into the inner ear induced type I hair cell
regeneration and synaptic formation. However, neither the number nor the
appearance of the hair cells was normal.

Hearing loss is mainly caused by loss of sensory hair cells (HCs) in the organ of
Corti or cochlea. Although embryonic stem (ES) cells are a promising source for
cell therapy, little is known about the efficient generation of HC-like cells
from ES cells. In the present study, we developed a single-medium culture method 
for growing embryoid bodies (EBs), in which conditioned medium (CM) from cultures
of ST2 stromal cells (ST2-CM) was used for 14-day cultures of 4-day EBs. At the
end of the 14-day cultures, up to 20% of the cells in EB outgrowths expressed
HC-related markers, including Math1 (also known as Atoh1), myosin6, myosin7a,
calretinin, a9AchR and Brn3c (also known as Pou4f3), and also showed formation of
stereocilia-like structures. Further, we found that these cells were incorporated
into the developing inner ear after transplantation into chick embryos. The
present inner ear HC induction method using ST2-CM (HIST2 method) is quite simple
and highly efficient to obtain ES-derived HC-like cells with a relatively short
cultivation time.

Intestinal epithelium has the capacity to self-renew and generate differentiated 
cells through the existence of two types of epithelial stem cells: active crypt
base columnar cells (CBCs) and quiescent +4 cells. The behaviors of these cells
are regulated both by intrinsic programs and by extrinsic signals sent by
neighboring cells, which define the niche. It is clear that the ß-catenin pathway
acts as an essential intrinsic signal for the maintenance and proliferation of
CBC, and it was recently proposed that Paneth cells provide a crucial niche by
secreting Wingless/Int (Wnt) ligands. Here, we examined the effect of disrupting 
the intestinal stem cell niche by inducible deletion of the transcription factor 
Math1 (Atoh1), an essential driver of secretory cell differentiation. We found
that complete loss of Paneth cells attributable to Math1 deficiency did not
perturb the crypt architecture and allowed the maintenance and proliferation of
CBCs. Indeed, Math1-deficient crypt cells tolerated in vivo Paneth cell loss and 
maintained active ß-catenin signaling but could not grow ex vivo without
exogenous Wnt, implying that, in vivo, underlying mucosal cells act as potential 
niche. Upon irradiation, Math1-deficient crypt cells regenerated and CBCs
continued cycling. Finally, CBC stem cells deficient in adenomatous polyposis
coli (Apc) and Math1 were able to promote intestinal tumorigenesis. We conclude
that in vivo, Math1-deficient crypts counteract the absence of Paneth
cell-derived Wnts and prevent CBC stem cell exhaustion.

Hearing impairment due to the loss of sensory hair cells is permanent in humans. 
Considerable interest targets the hair cell differentiation factor Atoh1 as a
potential tool with which to promote hair cell regeneration. We generated a novel
mouse model to direct the expression of Atoh1 in a spatially and temporally
specific manner in the postnatal mammalian cochlea to determine the competency of
various types of cochlear epithelial cells for hair cell differentiation. Atoh1
can generate cells in young animals with morphological, molecular, and
physiological properties reminiscent of hair cells. This competency is cell type 
specific and progressively restricted with age. Significantly, Atoh1 induces
ectopic sensory patches through Notch signaling to form a cellular mosaic similar
to the endogenous sensory epithelia and expansion of the sensory mosaic through
the conversion of supporting cells and nonautonomous supporting cell production. 
Furthermore, Atoh1 also activates proliferation within the normally postmitotic
cochlear epithelium. These results provide insight into the potential and
limitations of Atoh1-mediated hair cell regeneration.

Unlike nonmammalian vertebrates, mammals cannot convert inner ear cochlear
supporting cells (SCs) into sensory hair cells (HCs) after damage, thus causing
permanent deafness. Here, we achieved in vivo conversion of two SC subtypes,
pillar cells (PCs) and Deiters' cells (DCs), into HCs by inducing targeted
expression of Atoh1 at neonatal and juvenile ages using novel mouse models. The
conversion only occurred in ~10% of PCs and DCs with ectopic Atoh1 expression and
started with reactivation of endogenous Atoh1 followed by expression of 11 HC and
synaptic markers, a process that took approximately 3 weeks in vivo. These new
HCs resided in the outer HC region, formed stereocilia, contained
mechanoelectrical transduction channels, and survived for >2 months in vivo;
however, they surprisingly lacked prestin and oncomodulin expression and mature
HC morphology. In contrast, adult PCs and DCs no longer responded to ectopic
Atoh1 expression, even after outer HC damage. Finally, permanent Atoh1 expression
in endogenous HCs did not affect prestin expression but caused cell loss of
mature HCs. Together, our results demonstrate that in vivo conversion of PCs and 
DCs into immature HCs by Atoh1 is age dependent and resembles normal HC
development. Therefore, combined expression of Atoh1 with additional factors
holds therapeutic promise to convert PCs and DCs into functional HCs in vivo for 
regenerative purposes.

Atoh1 expression and function during auditory hair cell regeneration in
post-hatch chickens.

Lewis RM(1), Hume CR, Stone JS.

(1)Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, 
WA 98195-7923, USA.

Loss of hair cells in humans leads to irreversible hearing deficits, since
auditory hair cells are not replaced. In contrast, hair cells are regenerated in 
the auditory epithelium of mature birds after damage by non-sensory supporting
cells that transdifferentiate into hair cells by mitotic and/or non-mitotic
mechanisms. Factors controlling these processes are poorly understood. The basic 
helix-loop-helix transcription factor ATOH1 is both necessary and sufficient for 
developmental hair cell differentiation, but it is unclear if it plays the same
role in the mitotic and non-mitotic pathways in hair cell regeneration. We
examined Atoh1 expression and function during hair cell regeneration in chickens.
Atoh1 transcripts were increased in many supporting cells in the damaged auditory
epithelium shortly after ototoxin administration and later became restricted to
differentiating hair cells. Fate-mapping in vitro using an Atoh1 enhancer
reporter demonstrated that only 56% of the supporting cells that spontaneously
upregulate Atoh1 enhancer activity after damage acquired the hair cell fate.
Inhibition of notch signaling using a gamma secretase antagonist stimulated an
increase in Atoh1 reporter activity and induced a higher proportion of supporting
cells with Atoh1 activity (73%) to differentiate as hair cells. Forced
overexpression of Atoh1 in supporting cells triggered 66% of them to acquire the 
hair cell fate and nearly tripled their likelihood of cell cycle entry. These
findings demonstrate that Atoh1 is broadly upregulated in supporting cells after 
damage, but a substantial proportion of supporting cells with Atoh1 activation
fails to acquire hair cell features, in part due to gamma secretase-dependent
activities.

Hindbrain dorsal interneurons that comprise the rhombic lip relay sensory
information and coordinate motor outputs. The progenitor dA1 subgroup of
interneurons, which is formed along the dorsal-most region of the caudal rhombic 
lip, gives rise to the cochlear and precerebellar nuclei. These centers project
sensory inputs toward upper-brain regions. The fundamental role of dA1
interneurons in the assembly and function of these brainstem nuclei is well
characterized. However, the precise en route axonal patterns and synaptic targets
of dA1 interneurons are not clear as of yet. Novel genetic tools were used to
label dA1 neurons and trace their axonal trajectories and synaptic connections at
various stages of chick embryos. Using dA1-specific enhancers, two contralateral 
ascending axonal projection patterns were identified; one derived from
rhombomeres 6-7 that elongated in the dorsal funiculus, while the other
originated from rhombomeres 2-5 and extended in the lateral funiculus. Targets of
dA1 axons were followed at later stages using PiggyBac-mediated DNA
transposition. dA1 axons were found to project and form synapses in the auditory 
nuclei and cerebellum. Investigation of mechanisms that regulate the patterns of 
dA1 axons revealed a fundamental role of Lim-homeodomain (HD) proteins. Switch in
the expression of the specific dA1 Lim-HD proteins Lhx2/9 into Lhx1, which is
typically expressed in dB1 interneurons, modified dA1 axonal patterns to project 
along the routes of dB1 subgroup. Together, the results of this research provided
new tools and knowledge to the assembly of trajectories and connectivity of
hindbrain dA1 interneurons and of molecular mechanisms that control these
patterns.

In recent years, there has been significant progress in the use of Cre-loxP
technology for conditional gene expression in the inner ear. Here, we introduce
the basic concepts of this powerful technology, emphasizing the differences
between Cre and CreER. We describe the creation and Cre expression pattern of
each Cre and CreER mouse line that has been reported to have expression in
auditory and vestibular organs. We compare the Cre expression patterns between
Atoh1-CreER(TM) and Atoh1-CreER(T2) and report a new line, Fgfr3-iCreER(T2),
which displays inducible Cre activity in cochlear supporting cells. We also
explain how results can vary when transgenic vs. knock-in Cre/CreER alleles are
used to alter gene expression. We discuss practical issues that arise when using 
the Cre-loxP system, such as the use of proper controls, Cre efficiency, reporter
expression efficiency, and Cre leakiness. Finally, we introduce other methods for
conditional gene expression, including Flp recombinase and the
tetracycline-inducible system, which can be combined with Cre-loxP mouse models
to investigate conditional expression of more than one gene.

The cerebellum controls smooth and skillful movements and it is also involved in 
higher cognitive and emotional functions. The cerebellum is derived from the
dorsal part of the anterior hindbrain and contains two groups of cerebellar
neurons: glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons. Purkinje 
cells are GABAergic and granule cells are glutamatergic. Granule and Purkinje
cells receive input from outside of the cerebellum from mossy and climbing
fibers. Genetic analysis of mice and zebrafish has revealed genetic cascades that
control the development of the cerebellum and cerebellar neural circuits. During 
early neurogenesis, rostrocaudal patterning by intrinsic and extrinsic factors,
such as Otx2, Gbx2 and Fgf8, plays an important role in the positioning and
formation of the cerebellar primordium. The cerebellar glutamatergic neurons are 
derived from progenitors in the cerebellar rhombic lip, which express the
proneural gene Atoh1. The GABAergic neurons are derived from progenitors in the
ventricular zone, which express the proneural gene Ptf1a. The mossy and climbing 
fiber neurons originate from progenitors in the hindbrain rhombic lip that
express Atoh1 or Ptf1a. Purkinje cells exhibit mediolateral compartmentalization 
determined on the birthdate of Purkinje cells, and linked to the precise neural
circuitry formation. Recent studies have shown that anatomy and development of
the cerebellum is conserved between mammals and bony fish (teleost species). In
this review, we describe the development of cerebellar neurons and neural
circuitry, and discuss their evolution by comparing developmental processes of
mammalian and teleost cerebellum.

A key issue in otitis media is mucous cell metaplasia which is responsible for
mucous hypersecretion and persistence of the disease. However, little is known
about the molecular mechanisms of mucous cell metaplasia in otitis media.
Numerous studies of intestinal epithelial homeostasis have shown that Atonal
homolog 1 (Atoh1), a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, is
essential for the intestinal goblet cell differentiation. On the other hand,
SAM-pointed domain-containing Ets transcription factor (SPDEF), a member of the
"Ets" transcription factor family, has been reported to trigger the mucous cell
metaplasia of pulmonary infectious diseases or athsma. Recent studies have
demonstrated the relation of these factors, that is, Spdef functions downstream
of Atoh1. We could take the adventages of these findings for the study of otitis 
media because both middle ear and pulmonary epithelia belong to the same
respiratory tract. Atoh1 and SPDEF could be the therapeutic targets for otitis
media associated with mucous cell metaplasia which is frequently considered
"intractable" in the clinical settings.

Rp58 is essential for the growth and patterning of the cerebellum and for

Cerebellum development depends on the correct differentiation of progenitors into
neurons, a process controlled by a transcriptional program that remains poorly
understood. Here we show that neural-specific deletion of the BTB/POZ zinc-finger
transcription factor-encoding gene Rp58 (Znf238, Zfp238) causes severe cerebellar
hypoplasia and developmental failure of Purkinje neurons, Bergmann glia and
granule neurons. Deletion of Rp58 in mouse embryonic Atoh1(+) progenitors leads
to strong defects in growth and foliation owing to its crucial role in the
differentiation of granule neurons. Analysis of the Rp58 mutant at E14.5
demonstrates that Rp58 is required for the development of both glutamatergic and 
GABAergic neurons. Rp58 mutants show decreased proliferation of glutamatergic
progenitors at E14.5. In addition, Rp58 ablation results in a reduced number of
GABAergic Pax2(+) neurons at E16.5 together with defects in the transcriptional
program of ventricular zone progenitors. Our results indicate that Rp58 is
essential for the growth and organization of the cerebellum and regulates the
development of both GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons.

In a previous project, we screened the American mink Bacterial Artificial
Chromosome library, CHORI-231, for genes potentially involved in various coat
colour phenotypes in the American mink. Subsequently, we 454 sequenced the
inserts containing these genes and developed microsatellite markers for each of
these genes. Here, we describe a lack of association between three different
'roan-type' phenotypes represented by Cross, Stardust and Cinnamon in American
mink and six different genes that we considered to be potentially linked to these
phenotypes. Thus, c-KIT (HUGO-approved symbol KIT), ATOH-1 (HUGO-approved symbol 
ATOH1) and POMC were excluded as potential candidates for these three phenotypes.
In addition, MITF and SLC24A5 were excluded for Cross and Cinnamon, and KITL
(HUGO-approved symbol KITLG) for Cross and Stardust. Although most of these genes
have been implicated as the cause of similar phenotypes in other mammals,
including horses, pigs, cows, dogs, cats, mice and humans, they do not appear to 
be responsible for comparable phenotypes found in American mink.

Cerebellar liponeurocytoma (cLPN) is a very rare central nervous system (CNS)
tumour recently recognized as a clinical and pathological entity distinct from
medulloblastoma (MB), and included in the WHO classification of CNS tumours under
the heading "glioneuronal tumours". cLPN typically develop in adult age and have 
a favourable prognosis compared with MB. In this work, we reviewed the clinical
and neuroradiological data of two novel cases of adult cLPN diagnosed at our
institution; one patient developed distant metastases. We tried to identify novel
molecular markers for this malignancy. We found that the transcription factor
NEUROG1 (but not ATOH1) is expressed in cLPN, unlike normal adult cerebellum, and
that fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), typically found in adipocytes, is
significantly overexpressed compared with both normal adult cerebellum and human 
MB. These findings suggest cLPN occur as a result of transformation of cerebellar
progenitors, which are distinct from cerebellar granule progenitors, and
aberrantly differentiate into adipocyte-like tumour cells. They also suggest that
analysis of FABP4 expression is of help to differentiate cLPN from MB.

determination of cell differentiation. ATOH1 (a factor associated with Notch
signaling) plays an important role in differentiation of stem cells into goblet
cells. However, the relationship between the Notch signaling pathway and Cdx2
expression in the development of Barrett's esophagus has not been explored. The
aim of this study was to investigate the interrelationship between Notch
signaling and Cdx2 in esophageal epithelial cells. The expressions of Cdx2, MUC2,
and intracellular signaling molecules related to Notch signaling (Notch1, Hes1,
and ATOH1) were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
immunohistochemical staining with biopsy specimens obtained from esophageal
intestinal metaplasia (IM) with goblet cells (IM<U+207A>) and columnar epithelium not
accompanied by goblet cells (IM<U+207B>). For in vitro experiments, we employed human
esophageal epithelial cell lines (OE33, OE19, and Het-1A). After forced Cdx2
expression by applying a Cdx2 expression vector to the cells, changes in the
expressions of Notch1, Hes1, ATOH1, Cdx2, and MUC2 were analyzed by real-time PCR
and western blot analysis. Changes in expressions of Notch1, Hes1, ATOH1, Cdx2,
and MUC2 in cells were analyzed following stimulation with bile acids in the
presence or absence of Cdx2 blocking with Cdx2-siRNA. Suppressed Hes1 and
enhanced ATOH1 and MUC2 expressions were identified in IM<U+207A> specimens. Forced
expression of Cdx2 in cells suppressed Hes1, and enhanced ATOH1 and MUC2
expressions, whereas bile acids suppressed Hes1, and enhanced ATOH1, Cdx2, and
MUC2 expressions. On the other hand, these effects were blocked by siRNA-based
Cdx2 downregulation. Enhanced expression of Cdx2 by stimulation with bile acids
may induce intestinal differentiation of esophageal columnar cells by interaction
with the Notch signaling pathway.

Neuroblastoma is an aggressive pediatric tumor that accounts for 15% of
cancer-related deaths in children. More than half of high-risk neuroblastoma
patients develop tumor relapse that is lethal in most cases. A small population
of tumor-initiating cells (TICs), recently identified from high-risk
neuroblastoma patients as spheres, is believed to be responsible for tumor
relapse. Rab family small G proteins are essential in controlling membrane
traffic and their misregulation results in several cancers. Rab15 was originally 
isolated as a brain-specific Rab protein regulating the endocytic recycling
pathway and was recently identified as a downstream target of the neural
transcription factor Atoh1. Previously, we identified two alternatively spliced
Rab15 isoforms in neuroblastoma cells and showed a significant correlation
between Rab15 expression and neuronal differentiation. As aberrant alternative
splicing is intimately associated with an increasing number of cancers, its use
as a new diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarker has attracted considerable
attention. In the present study, we explored cancer-associated changes of Rab15
alternative splicing in neuroblastoma TICs. We found that Rab15 alternative
splicing generated two novel isoforms designated as Rab15(AN2) and Rab15(AN3) in 
addition to two known isoforms designated as Rab15(CN) and Rab15(AN1). Although
both Rab15(AN2) and Rab15(AN3) contained premature termination codons, they were 
detected in not only neuroblastoma cells but also in normal human tissues. One
isoform was predominantly expressed in the brain and testis, while the other
isoform was more specifically expressed in the brain. In neuroblastoma, Rab15
isoform balance measured by the Rab15(CN)/Rab15(AN1+AN2+AN3) ratio was
significantly decreased in spheres compared to parental cells. These results
suggest that Rab15 alternative splicing may serve as a biomarker to discriminate 
TICs from non-TICs in neuroblastoma.

Functional features of trans-differentiated hair cells mediated by Atoh1 reveals 
a primordial mechanism.

Evolution has transformed a simple ear with few vestibular maculae into a complex
three-dimensional structure consisting of nine distinct endorgans. It is
debatable whether the sensory epithelia underwent progressive segregation or
emerged from distinct sensory patches. To address these uncertainties we examined
the morphological and functional phenotype of trans-differentiated rat hair cells
to reveal their primitive or endorgan-specific origins. Additionally, it is
uncertain how Atoh1-mediated trans-differentiated hair cells trigger the
processes that establish their neural ranking from the vestibulocochlear ganglia.
We have demonstrated that the morphology and functional expression of ionic
currents in trans-differentiated hair cells resemble those of "ancestral" hair
cells, even at the lesser epithelia ridge aspects of the cochlea. The structures 
of stereociliary bundles of trans-differentiated hair cells were in keeping with 
cells in the vestibule. Functionally, the transient expression of Na<U+207A> and I(h)
currents initiates and promotes evoked spikes. Additionally, Ca²<U+207A> current was
expressed and underwent developmental changes. These events correlate well with
the innervation of ectopic hair cells. New "born" hair cells at the abneural
aspects of the cochlea are innervated by spiral ganglion neurons, presumably
under the tropic influence of chemoattractants. The disappearance of inward
currents coincides well with the attenuation of evoked electrical activity,
remarkably recapitulating the development of hair cells. Ectopic hair cells
underwent stepwise changes in the magnitude and kinetics of transducer currents. 
We propose that Atoh1 mediates trans-differentiation of morphological and
functional "ancestral" hair cells that are likely to undergo diversification in
an endorgan-specific manner.

In the nervous system, there are hundreds to thousands of neuronal cell types
that have morphologically, physiologically, and histochemically different
characteristics and this diversity may enable us to elicit higher brain function.
A better understanding of the molecular machinery by which neuron subtype
specification occurs is thus one of the most important issues in brain science.
The dorsal hindbrain, including the cerebellum, is a good model system to study
this issue because a variety of types of neurons are produced from this region.
Recently developed genetic lineage-tracing methods in addition to gene-transfer
technologies have clarified a fate map of neurons produced from the dorsal
hindbrain and accelerated our understanding of the molecular machinery of
neuronal subtype specification in the nervous system.

Transforming the vestibular system one molecule at a time: the molecular and
developmental basis of vertebrate auditory evolution.

We review the molecular basis of auditory development and evolution. We propose
that the auditory periphery (basilar papilla, organ of Corti) evolved by
transforming a newly created and redundant vestibular (gravistatic) endorgan into
a sensory epithelium that could respond to sound instead of gravity. Evolution
altered this new epithelia's mechanoreceptive properties through changes of hair 
cells, positioned the epithelium in a unique position near perilymphatic space to
extract sound moving between the round and the oval window, and transformed its
otolith covering into a tympanic membrane. Another important step in the
evolution of an auditory system was the evolution of a unique set of "auditory
neurons" that apparently evolved from vestibular neurons. Evolution of mammalian 
auditory (spiral ganglion) neurons coincides with GATA3 being a transcription
factor found selectively in the auditory afferents. For the auditory information 
to be processed, the CNS required a dedicated center for auditory processing, the
auditory nuclei. It is not known whether the auditory nucleus is ontogenetically 
related to the vestibular or electroreceptive nuclei, two sensory systems found
in aquatic but not in amniotic vertebrates, or a de-novo formation of the rhombic
lip in line with other novel hindbrain structures such as pontine nuclei. Like
other novel hindbrain structures, the auditory nuclei express exclusively the
bHLH gene Atoh1, and loss of Atoh1 results in loss of most of this nucleus in
mice. Only after the basilar papilla, organ of Corti evolved could efferent
neurons begin to modulate their activity. These auditory efferents most likely
evolved from vestibular efferent neurons already present. The most simplistic
interpretation of available data suggest that the ear, sensory neurons, auditory 
nucleus, and efferent neurons have been transformed by altering the developmental
genetic modules necessary for their development into a novel direction conducive 
for sound extraction, conduction, and processing.

Atoh1, an essential transcription factor in neurogenesis and intestinal and inner
ear development: function, regulation, and context dependency.

Atoh1 (also known as Math1, Hath1, and Cath1 in mouse, human, and chicken,
respectively) is a proneural basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor
that is required in a variety of developmental contexts. Atoh1 is involved in
differentiation of neurons, secretory cells in the gut, and mechanoreceptors
including auditory hair cells. Together with the two closely related bHLH genes, 
Neurog1 and NeuroD1, Atoh1 regulates neurosensory development in the ear as well 
as neurogenesis in the cerebellum. Atoh1 activity in the cochlea is both
necessary and sufficient to drive auditory hair cell differentiation, in keeping 
with its known role as a regulator of various genes that are markers of terminal 
differentiation. Atoh1 is known in other fields as an oncogene and a tumor
suppressor involved in regulation of cell cycle control and apoptosis. Aberrant
Atoh1 activity in adult tissue is implicated in cancer progression, specifically 
in medullablastoma and adenomatous polyposis carcinoma. We demonstrate through
protein sequence comparison that Atoh1 contains conserved phosphorylation sites
outside the bHLH domain, which may allow regulation through post-translational
modification. With such diverse roles, tight regulation of Atoh1 at both the
transcriptional and protein level is essential.

Intact function of Lgr5 receptor-expressing intestinal stem cells in the absence 
of Paneth cells.

Author information:

Lifelong self-renewal of the adult intestinal epithelium requires the activity of
stem cells located in mucosal crypts. Lgr5 and Bmi1 are two molecular markers of 
crypt-cell populations that replenish all lineages over time and hence function
as stem cells. Intestinal stem cells require Wnt signaling, but the understanding
of their cellular niche is incomplete. Lgr5-expressing crypt base columnar cells 
(CBCs) reside deep in the crypt, mingled among mature Paneth cells that are well 
positioned for short-range signaling. Partial lineage ablation previously had
implied that Paneth cells are nonessential constituents of the stem-cell niche,
but recently their absence was reported to interfere with Lgr5(+) CBCs,
resurrecting an appealing idea. However, previous mouse models failed to remove
Paneth cells completely or permanently; defining the intestinal stem-cell niche
requires clarity with respect to the Paneth cell role. We find that Lgr5(+) cells
with stem-cell activity cluster in future crypts early in life, before Paneth
cells develop. We also crossed conditional Atoh1(-/-) mice, which lack Paneth
cells entirely, with Lgr5(GFP) mice to visualize Lgr5(+) CBCs and to track their 
stem-cell function. In the sustained absence of Paneth cells, Lgr5(+) CBCs
occupied the full crypt base, proliferated briskly, and generated differentiated 
progeny over many months. Gene expression in fluorescence-sorted Lgr5(+) CBCs
reflected intact Wnt signaling despite the loss of Paneth cells. Thus, Paneth
cells are dispensable for survival, proliferation, and stem-cell activity of
CBCs, and direct contact with Lgr5-nonexpressing cells is not essential for CBC
function.

In vivo Notch reactivation in differentiating cochlear hair cells induces Sox2
and Prox1 expression but does not disrupt hair cell maturation.

Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.

BACKGROUND: Notch signaling is active in mouse cochlear prosensory progenitors
but declines in differentiating sensory hair cells (HCs). Overactivation of the
Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) in progenitors blocks HC fate commitment
and/or differentiation. However, it is not known whether reactivation of NICD in 
differentiating HCs also interrupts their developmental program and reactivates
its downstream targets.
RESULTS: By analyzing Atoh1(CreER+) ; Rosa26-NICD(loxp/+) or Atoh1(CreER+) ;
Rosa26-NICD(loxp/+) ; RBP-J(loxp/loxp) mice, we demonstrated that ectopic NICD in
differentiating HCs caused reactivation of Sox2 and Prox1 in an RBP-J-dependent
manner. Interestingly, Prox1 reactivation was exclusive to outer HCs (OHCs). In
addition, lineage tracing analysis of Prox1(CreER/+) ; Rosa26-EYFP(loxp/+) and
Prox1(CreEGFP/+) ; Rosa26-EYFP(loxp/+) mice showed that nearly all HCs
experiencing Prox1 expression were OHCs. Surprisingly, these HCs still matured
normally with expression of prestin, wild-type-like morphology, and uptake of
FM4-64FX dye at adult ages.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the developmental program of cochlear
differentiating HCs is refractory to Notch reactivation and that Notch is an
upstream regulator of Sox2 and Prox1 in cochlear development. In addition, our
results support that Sox2 and Prox1 should not be the main blockers for terminal 
differentiation of HCs newly regenerated from postnatal cochlear SCs that still
maintain Sox2 and Prox1 expression.

Medulloblastoma is a malignant brain tumor of childhood that comprises at least
four molecularly distinct subgroups. We have previously described that cerebellar
granule neuron precursors may give rise to the subgroup with a molecular
fingerprint of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. Other recent data indicate that
precursor cells within the dorsal brain stem may serve as cellular origins for
Wnt-associated medulloblastomas. To see whether Shh-associated medulloblastomas
are also able to develop in the dorsal brainstem, we analyzed two lines of
transgenic mice with constitutive Shh signaling in hGFAP- and Math1-positive
brainstem precursor populations, respectively. Our results show that in both of
these lines, medulloblastomas arise from granule neuron precursors of the
cochlear nuclei, a derivative of the auditory lower rhombic lip. This region is
distinct from derivatives of precerebellar lower rhombic lip where
medulloblastomas arise in mice with constitutive-active Wnt signaling. With
respect to their histology and the expression of appropriate markers, Shh tumors 
from the murine cochlear nuclei perfectly resemble human Shh-associated
medulloblastomas. Moreover, we find that in a series of 63 human desmoplastic
medulloblastomas, 21 (33%) have a very close contact to the cochlear nuclei on MR
imaging. In conclusion, we demonstrate that precursors of the murine rhombic lip,
which either develop into cerebellar or into cochlear granule neurons, may give
rise to Shh-associated medulloblastoma, and this has important implications for
the cellular origin of human medulloblastomas.

Eya1-Six1 interaction is sufficient to induce hair cell fate in the cochlea by
activating Atoh1 expression in cooperation with Sox2.

Inner-ear hair cell differentiation requires Atoh1 function, while Eya1, Six1,
and Sox2 are coexpressed in sensory progenitors and mutations in these genes
cause sensorineural hearing loss. However, how these genes are linked
functionally and the transcriptional networks controlling hair cell induction
remain unclear. Here, we show (1) that Eya1/Six1 are necessary for hair cell
development, and their coexpression in mouse cochlear explants is sufficient to
induce hair cell fate in the nonsensory epithelium expressing low-level Sox2 by
activating not only Atoh1-dependent but also Atoh1-independent pathways and (2)
that both pathways induce Pou4f3 to promote hair cell differentiation. Sox2
cooperates with Eya1/Six1 to synergistically activate Atoh1 transcription via
direct binding to the conserved Sox- and Six-binding sites in Atoh1 enhancers,
and these proteins physically interact. Our findings demonstrate that direct and 
cooperative interactions between the Sox2, Six1, and Eya1 proteins coordinate
Atoh1 expression to specify hair cell fate.

Hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1) recruits polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)

HIC1 (hypermethylated in cancer 1) is a tumor suppressor gene epigenetically
silenced or deleted in many human cancers. HIC1 is involved in regulatory loops
modulating p53- and E2F1-dependent cell survival, growth control, and stress
responses. HIC1 is also essential for normal development because Hic1-deficient
mice die perinatally and exhibit gross developmental defects throughout the
second half of development. HIC1 encodes a transcriptional repressor with five
C(2)H(2) zinc fingers mediating sequence-specific DNA binding and two repression 
domains: an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain and a central region recruiting CtBP and
NuRD complexes. By yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified the Polycomb-like
protein hPCL3 as a novel co-repressor for HIC1. Using multiple biochemical
strategies, we demonstrated that HIC1 interacts with hPCL3 and its paralog PHF1
to form a stable complex with the PRC2 members EZH2, EED, and Suz12. Confirming
the implication of HIC1 in Polycomb recruitment, we showed that HIC1 shares some 
of its target genes with PRC2, including ATOH1. Depletion of HIC1 by siRNA
interference leads to a partial displacement of EZH2 from the ATOH1 promoter.
Furthermore, in vivo, ATOH1 repression by HIC1 is associated with Polycomb
activity during mouse cerebellar development. Thus, our results identify HIC1 as 
the first transcription factor in mammals able to recruit PRC2 to some target
promoters through its interaction with Polycomb-like proteins.

Therapies aimed at the protection and/or regeneration of inner ear hair cells are
of great interest, given the significant monetary and quality of life impact of
balance disorders. Different viral vectors have been shown to transfect various
cell types in the inner ear. The past decade has provided tremendous advances in 
the use of adenoviral vectors to achieve targeted treatment delivery. Several
routes of delivery have been identified to introduce vectors into the inner ear
while minimizing injury to surrounding structures. Recently, the transcription
factor Atoh1 was determined to play a critical role in hair cell differentiation.
Adenoviral-mediated overexpression of Atoh1 in culture and in vivo has
demonstrated the ability to regenerate vestibular hair cells by causing
transdifferentiation of neighbouring epithelial-supporting cells. Functional
recovery of the vestibular system has also been documented following
adenoviral-induced Atoh1 overexpression. Experiments demonstrating gene transfer 
in human vestibular epithelial cells reveal that the human inner ear is a
suitable target for gene therapy.

The prosensory function of Sox2 in the chicken inner ear relies on the direct
regulation of Atoh1.

The proneural gene Atoh1 is crucial for the development of inner ear hair cells
and it requires the function of the transcription factor Sox2 through yet unknown
mechanisms. In the present work, we used the chicken embryo and HEK293T cells to 
explore the regulation of Atoh1 by Sox2. The results show that hair cells derive 
from Sox2-positive otic progenitors and that Sox2 directly activates Atoh1
through a transcriptional activator function that requires the integrity of Sox2 
DNA binding domain. Atoh1 activation depends on Sox transcription factor binding 
sites (SoxTFBS) present in the Atoh1 3' enhancer where Sox2 directly binds, as
shown by site directed mutagenesis and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). In
the inner ear, Atoh1 enhancer activity is detected in the neurosensory domain and
it depends on Sox2. Dominant negative competition (Sox2HMG-Engrailed) and
mutation of the SoxTFBS abolish the reporter activity in vivo. Moreover, ChIP
assay in isolated otic vesicles shows that Sox2 is bound to the Atoh1 enhancer in
vivo. However, besides activating Atoh1, Sox2 also promotes the expression of
Atoh1 negative regulators and the temporal profile of Atoh1 activation by Sox2 is
transient suggesting that Sox2 triggers an incoherent feed-forward loop. These
results provide a mechanism for the prosensory function of Sox2 in the inner ear.
We suggest that sensory competence is established early in otic development
through the activation of Atoh1 by Sox2, however, hair cell differentiation is
prevented until later stages by the parallel activation of negative regulators of
Atoh1 function.

In the mammalian inner ear neurosensory cell fate depends on three closely
related transcription factors, Atoh1 for hair cells and Neurog1 and Neurod1 for
neurons. We have previously shown that neuronal cell fate can be altered towards 
hair cell fate by eliminating Neurod1 mediated repression of Atoh1 expression in 
neurons. To test whether a similar plasticity is present in hair cell fate
commitment, we have generated a knockin (KI) mouse line (Atoh1(KINeurog1)) in
which Atoh1 is replaced by Neurog1. Expression of Neurog1 under Atoh1 promoter
control alters the cellular gene expression pattern, differentiation and survival
of hair cell precursors in both heterozygous (Atoh1(+/KINeurog1)) and homozygous 
(Atoh1(KINeurog1/KINeurog1)) KI mice. Homozygous KI mice develop patches of organ
of Corti precursor cells that express Neurog1, Neurod1, several prosensory genes 
and neurotrophins. In addition, these patches of cells receive afferent and
efferent processes. Some cells among these patches form multiple microvilli but
no stereocilia. Importantly, Neurog1 expressing mutants differ from Atoh1 null
mutants, as they have intermittent formation of organ of Corti-like patches,
opposed to a complete 'flat epithelium' in the absence of Atoh1. In heterozygous 
KI mice co-expression of Atoh1 and Neurog1 results in change in fate and
patterning of some hair cells and supporting cells in addition to the abnormal
hair cell polarity in the later stages of development. This differs from
haploinsufficiency of Atoh1 (Pax2cre; Atoh1(f/+)), indicating the effect of
Neurog1 expression in developing hair cells. Our data suggest that
Atoh1(KINeurog1) can provide some degree of functional support for survival of
organ of Corti cells. In contrast to the previously demonstrated fate plasticity 
of neurons to differentiate as hair cells, hair cell precursors can be maintained
for a limited time by Neurog1 but do not transdifferentiate as neurons.

Atonal homolog1 (Atoh1) is a bHLH transcription factor essential for inner ear
hair cell differentiation. Targeted expression of Atoh1 at various stages in
development can result in hair cell differentiation in the ear. However, the
level and duration of Atoh1 expression required for proper hair cell
differentiation and maintenance remain unknown. We generated an Atoh1 conditional
knockout (CKO) mouse line using Tg(Atoh1-cre), in which the cre expression is
driven by an Atoh1 enhancer element that is regulated by Atoh1 protein to
"self-terminate" its expression. The mutant mice show transient, limited
expression of Atoh1 in all hair cells in the ear. In the organ of Corti,
reduction and delayed deletion of Atoh1 result in progressive loss of almost all 
the inner hair cells and the majority of the outer hair cells within three weeks 
after birth. The remaining cells express hair cell marker Myo7a and attract nerve
fibers, but do not differentiate normal stereocilia bundles. Some Myo7a-positive 
cells persist in the cochlea into adult stages in the position of outer hair
cells, flanked by a single row of pillar cells and two to three rows of
disorganized Deiters cells. Gene expression analyses of Atoh1, Barhl1 and Pou4f3,
genes required for survival and maturation of hair cells, reveal earlier and
higher expression levels in the inner compared to the outer hair cells. Our data 
show that Atoh1 is crucial for hair cell mechanotransduction development,
viability, and maintenance and also suggest that Atoh1 expression level and
duration may play a role in inner vs. outer hair cell development. These
genetically engineered Atoh1 CKO mice provide a novel model for establishing
critical conditions needed to regenerate viable and functional hair cells with
Atoh1 therapy.

The Notch signaling pathway drives proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis,
cell fate, and maintenance of stem cells in several tissues. Aberrant activation 
of Notch signaling has been described in several tumours and in gastric cancer
(GC), activated Notch1 has been associated with de-differentiation of
lineage-committed stomach cells into stem progenitors and GC progression.
However, the specific role of the Notch1 ligand DLL1 in GC has not yet been
elucidated. To assess the role of DLL1 in GC cancer, the expression of Notch1 and
its ligands DLL1 and Jagged1, was analyzed in 8 gastric cancer cell lines
(KATOIII, SNU601, SNU719, AGS, SNU16, MKN1, MKN45, TMK1). DLL1 expression was
absent in KATOIII, SNU601, SNU719 and AGS. The lack of DLL1 expression in these
cells was associated with promoter hypermethylation and 5-aza-2'dC caused
up-regulation of DLL1. The increase in DLL1 expression was associated with
activation of Notch1 signalling, with an increase in cleaved Notch1 intracellular
domain (NICD) and Hes1, and down-regulation in Hath1. Concordantly, Notch1
signalling was activated with the overexpression of DLL1. Moreover, Notch1
signalling together with DLL1 methylation were evaluated in samples from 52 GC
patients and 21 healthy control as well as in INS-GAS mice infected with H.
pylori and randomly treated with eradication therapy. In GC patients, we found a 
correlation between DLL1 and Hes1 expression, while DLL1 methylation and Hath1
expression were associated with the diffuse and mixed type of gastric cancer.
Finally, none of the samples from INS-GAS mice infected with H. pylori, a model
of intestinal-type gastric tumorigenesis, showed promoter methylation of DLL1.
This study shows that Notch1 activity in gastric cancer is controlled by the
epigenetic silencing of the ligand DLL1, and that Notch1 inhibition is associated
with the diffuse type of gastric cancer.

Previous studies showed that Math1 homologous to human Hath1 can cause mouse
goblet cells to differentiate. In this context it is important that the majority 
of colon cancers have few goblet cells. In the present study, the potential role 
of Hath1 in colon carcinogenesis was investigated. Sections of paraffin-embedded 
tissues were used to investigate the goblet cell population of normal colon
mucosa, mucosa adjacent colon cancer and colon cancer samples from 48 patients.
Hath1 and Muc2 expression in these samples were tested by immunohistochemistry,
quantitative real-time reverse transcription -PCR and Western blotting. After the
recombinant plasmid, pcDNA3.1(+)-Hath1 had been transfected into HT29 colon
cancer cells, three clones were selected randomly to test the levels of Hath1
mRNA, Muc2 mRNA, Hath1, Muc2, cyclin D1 and p27 by quantitative real-time reverse
transcription-PCR and Western blotting. Moreover, the proliferative ability of
HT29 cells introduced with Hath1 was assessed by means of colony formation assay 
and xenografting. Expression of Hath1, Muc2, cyclin D1 and p27 in the xenograft
tumors was also detected by Western blotting. No goblet cells were to be found in
colon cancer and levels of Hath1 mRNA and Hath1, Muc2 mRNA and Muc2 were
significantly down-regulated. Hath1 could decrease cyclin D1, increase p27 and
Muc2 in HT29 cells and inhibit their proliferation. Hath1 may be an anti-oncogene
in colon carcinogenesis.

Notch signaling is known to regulate the proliferation and differentiation of
intestinal stem and progenitor cells; however, direct cellular targets and
specific functions of Notch signals had not been identified. We show here in mice
that Notch directly targets the crypt base columnar (CBC) cell to maintain stem
cell activity. Notch inhibition induced rapid CBC cell loss, with reduced
proliferation, apoptotic cell death and reduced efficiency of organoid
initiation. Furthermore, expression of the CBC stem cell-specific marker Olfm4
was directly dependent on Notch signaling, with transcription activated through
RBP-J<U+03BA> binding sites in the promoter. Notch inhibition also led to precocious
differentiation of epithelial progenitors into secretory cell types, including
large numbers of cells that expressed both Paneth and goblet cell markers.
Analysis of Notch function in Atoh1-deficient intestine demonstrated that the
cellular changes were dependent on Atoh1, whereas Notch regulation of Olfm4 gene 
expression was Atoh1 independent. Our findings suggest that Notch targets
distinct progenitor cell populations to maintain adult intestinal stem cells and 
to regulate cell fate choice to control epithelial cell homeostasis.

Mix progenitors are short-lived multipotential cells formed as intestinal
epithelial stem cells initiate a differentiation program. Clone dynamics
indicates that various epithelial cell lineages arise from Mix via a sequence of 
progressively restricted progenitor states. Lateral inhibitory Notch signaling
between the daughters of Mix (DOM) is thought to break their initial symmetry,
thereby determining whether a DOM invokes a columnar (absorptive) or granulocytic
(secretory) cell lineage program. This is supported by the absence of
granulocytes following enforced Notch signaling or Atoh1 deletion. Conversely,
granulocytes increase in frequency following inhibition of Notch signaling or
Hes1 deletion. Thus reciprocal repression between Hes1 and Atoh1 is thought to
implement a Notch signaling-driven cell-fate-determining binary switch in DOM.
The brush (tuft) cells, a poorly understood chemosensory cell type, are not
incorporated into this model. We report that brush cell numbers increase
dramatically following conditional Atoh1-deletion, demonstrating that brush cell 
production, determination, differentiation and survival are Atoh1-independent. We
also report that brush cells are derived from Gfi1b-expressing progenitors. These
and related results suggest a model in which initially equivalent DOM progenitors
have three metastable states defined by the transcription factors Hes1, Atoh1,
and Gfi1b. Lateral inhibitory Notch signaling normally ensures that Hes1
dominates in one of the two DOMs, invoking a columnar lineage program, while
either Atoh1 or Gfi1b dominates in the other DOM, invoking a granulocytic or
brush cell lineage program, respectively, and thus implementing a cell
fate-determining ternary switch.

Wnt1 expression temporally allocates upper rhombic lip progenitors and defines
their terminal cell fate in the cerebellum.

Hagan N(1), Zervas M.

Author information:

University, Providence, RI 02903, USA.

The cerebellum (Cb) controls movement related physiology using a diverse array of
morphologically and biochemically distinct neurons. During development, the Cb is
derived from rhombomere 1 (r1), an embryonic compartment patterned by a signaling
center referred to as the isthmus organizer. The secreted glycoprotein WNT1 is
expressed in the midbrain primordia (mesencephalon, mes) and at the posterior
limit of the mes. WNT1 plays a pivotal role in maintaining the isthmus organizer 
and mutations in Wnt1 produce severe Cb defects that are generally attributed to 
aberrant organizer activity. Interestingly, Wnt1 is also expressed at the most
posterior limit of dorsal r1, in a region known as the upper rhombic lip (URL).
However, the distribution and molecular identity of Wnt1 expressing progenitors
have not been carefully described in r1. We used Wnt1-Venus transgenic mice to
generate a molecular map of Wnt1 expressing progenitors in relation to other well
characterized Cb biomarkers such as MATH1 (ATOH1), LMX1a and OTX2. Our analysis
validated Wnt1 expression in the URL and revealed molecularly-defined
developmental zones in r1. We then used genetic inducible fate mapping (GIFM) to 
link transient Wnt1 expression in r1 to terminal cell fates in the mature Cb.
Wnt1 expressing progenitors primarily contributed to neurons in deep cerebellar
nuclei, granule cells, and unipolar brush cells in distinct but overlapping
temporal windows and sparsely contributed to inhibitory neurons and Bergmann
glia. We further demonstrate that the Wnt1 lineage does not follow a competency
model of progressive lineage restriction to generate the Cb or the functionally
related precerebellar system. Instead, progenitors initiate Wnt1 expression de
novo to give rise to each Cb cell type and precerebellar nuclei. We also used
GIFM to determine how the temporal control of Wnt1 expression is related to
molecular identity and cell migration in Cb development. Our findings provide new
insight into how lineage and timing establish cell diversity within the Cb
system.

Calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand (Caml) is a ubiquitously expressed
cytoplasmic protein that is involved in multiple signaling and developmental
pathways. An observation in our laboratory of a protein-protein interaction
between Caml and the cytoplasmic region of Cadherin23 led us to speculate that
Caml might be important in the inner ear and play a role in the development
and/or function of hair cells. To address this question, we generated a mouse
line in which Caml expression was eliminated in Atoh1-expressing cells of the
inner ear upon administration of tamoxifen. Tamoxifen was administered
immediately after birth to neonates to assess the effect of loss of Caml in the
inner ear during postnatal development. Hearing in treated animals was tested by 
auditory brain stem response (ABR) analysis and cochlear pathology was evaluated 
by light microscopy. Lack of Caml expression in the inner ear leads to severe
loss of cochlear hair cells and complete deafness. Elucidating the role of Caml
in the inner ear will aid our understanding of the molecular pathways important
for auditory development and function.

Insulin-like growth factor signaling regulates the timing of sensory cell
differentiation in the mouse cochlea.

The mammalian auditory sensory epithelium, the organ of Corti, is a highly
ordered cellular structure that comprises two types of auditory hair cells and
several types of nonsensory supporting cells. During embryogenesis, a stereotyped
sequence of cellular and molecular events is required for its development. These 
processes are assumed to be regulated by multiple growth and transcription
factors. However, the majority of these factors have not been identified. One
potential regulator of cochlear development is the insulin-like growth factor
(IGF) signaling family. To examine the roles of the IGF pathway in inner ear
formation, cochleae from Igf1r mutant mice were analyzed. Deletion of Igf1r leads
to several changes in inner ear development including a shortened cochlear duct, 
a decrease in the total number of cochlear hair cells, and defects in the
formation of the semicircular canals. In addition, maturation of the cochlear
sensory epithelium was delayed at the transition point between cellular
proliferation and differentiation. To determine the molecular basis for these
defects, inhibition of IGF signaling was replicated pharmacologically in vitro.
Results indicated that IGF signaling regulates cochlear length and hair cell
number as well as Atoh1 expression through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt 
signaling pathway. These results demonstrate novel roles for IGF signaling in
inner ear development including regulation of vestibular formation, length of the
cochlear duct, and the number of cochlear hair cells. The results also provide
new insights regarding the pathological processes that underlie auditory defects 
in the absence of IGF signaling in both humans and mice.

Math1/Atoh1 contributes to intestinalization of esophageal keratinocytes by
inducing the expression of Muc2 and Keratin-20.

Pennsylvania, 650 CRB 415 Curie Blvd., Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

BACKGROUND: Esophageal intestinal metaplasia, also known as Barrett's esophagus, 
is the replacement of the normal epithelium with one that resembles the intestine
morphologically. Generally, this includes intestinal mucin-secreting goblet
cells. Barrett's esophagus is an important risk factor for adenocarcinoma
development. In-vitro models for Barrett's esophagus have not, to date, focused
on the induction of goblet cells in Barrett's epithelium.
AIMS: To explore the contribution of Math1/Atoh1 to induction of Barrett's
esophagus and intestinal mucin-secreting goblet cells from normal human
esophageal epithelium.
METHODS: We explored the level and pattern of Math1/Atoh1 mRNA and protein
expression in human Barrett's esophagus. Then, using retroviral-mediated gene
expression, we induced Math1 mRNA and protein expression in a human esophageal
keratinocyte cell line. We evaluated the effects of this ectopic Math1 expression
on cell proliferation and gene expression patterns in cells cultured under
two-dimensional and three-dimensional tissue-engineering conditions.
RESULTS: Math1/Atoh1 mRNA and protein are detected in human Barrett's esophagus
specimens, but the mRNA levels vary substantially. In the keratinocyte expression
studies, we observed that Math1/Atoh1 ectopic expression significantly reduced
cell proliferation and altered cell morphology. Moreover, Math1/Atoh1 expression 
is associated with a more intestinalized gene expression pattern that is distinct
from that reported in after studies using other intestinal transcription factors.
Most significantly, we observe the induction of the Barrett's esophagus markers
Mucin-2 and Keratin-20 with Math1/Atoh1 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that ectopic Math1/Atoh1 expression makes unique
contributions to intestinalization of the esophageal epithelium in Barrett's
esophagus.

Defects in sensory organ morphogenesis and generation of cochlear hair cells in
Gata3-deficient mouse embryos.

The development of the inner ear sensory epithelia involves a complex network of 
transcription factors and signaling pathways and the whole process is not yet
entirely understood. GATA3 is a DNA-binding factor that is necessary for otic
morphogenesis and without GATA3 variable defects have been observed already at
early stages in mouse embryos. In the less severe phenotypes, one small oval
shaped vesicle is formed whereas in the more severe cases, the otic epithelium
becomes disrupted and the endolymphatic domain becomes separated from the rest of
the otic epithelium. Despite these defects, the early sensory fate specification 
occurs in Gata3-/- otic epithelium. However, due to the early lethality of
Gata3-deficient embryos, the later morphogenesis and sensory development have
remained unclear. To gain information of these later processes we produced
drug-rescued Gata3-/- embryos that survived up to late gestation. In these older 
Gata3-/- embryos, a similar variability was observed as earlier. In the more
severely affected ears, the development of the separate endolymphatic domain
arrested completely whereas the remaining vesicle formed an empty cavity with
variable forms, but without any distinguishable otic compartments or
morphologically distinct sensory organs. However, the dorsal part of this vesicle
was able to adopt a sensory fate and to produce some hair cells. In the less
severe cases of Gata3-/- ears, distinct utricular, saccular and cochlear
compartments were present and hair cells could be detected in the vestibular
sensory epithelia. Although clear cristae and maculae formed, the morphology and 
size of these sensory areas were abnormal and they remained often un-separated.
In contrast to the vestibule, the cochlear sensory compartment remained more
immature and no hair or supporting cells could be detected. Our results suggest
that GATA3 is critical for normal vestibular and cochlear morphogenesis and that 
it is especially important for cochlear sensory differentiation.

OBJECTIVE: To clone Atoh1 gene coding sequence of SD rat and construct the
Eukaryotic expression plasmid pAtoh1-IRES2-EGFP,and to study its expression in
293T cells.
METHOD: Total RNA was extracted from colon of SD rat. Atoh1 cDNA was obtained by 
RT-PCR amplification and subcloned into PMD-19T vector. The purified digested
fragment was connected into Eukaryotic expression vector pIRES2-EGFP to construct
the recombinant plasmid. The recombinant expression plasmid was identified by
enzyme digestion and sequence analysis and then transfected into 293T cells with 
Lipofectamine. The expression of green fluorescent protein was detected through
fluorescence microscope.
RESULT: Compared cloned DNA sequence of Atoh1 gene CDS area with the reference
sequences published in GeneBank, there were two base nonsense mutation in the
sequence, deduced amino acid of cloning sequences as the same as reference
sequences. Two bases should be single nucleotide polymorphism. Results of enzyme 
digestion and sequencing confirmed the successful construction of the recombinant
plasmid. The expression of the green fluorescent protein was observed in the
transfected 293T cells 24 h after transfection by fluorescence microscope.
CONCLUSION: pIRES2-EGFP-Atoh1 can be constructed and expressed successfully in
the 293T cells, which will guide further research on gene therapy for
sensorineural hearing loss.

The capacity of adult mammals to regenerate sensory hair cells is not well
defined. To explore early steps in this process, we examined reactivation of a
transiently expressed developmental gene, Atoh1, in adult mouse utricles after
neomycin-induced hair cell death in culture. Using an adenoviral reporter for
Atoh1 enhancer, we found that Atoh1 transcription is activated in some hair cell 
progenitors (supporting cells) 3 d after neomycin treatment. By 18 d after
neomycin, the number of cells with Atoh1 transcriptional activity increased
significantly, but few cells acquired hair cell features (i.e., accumulated ATOH1
or myosin VIIa protein or developed stereocilia). Treatment with DAPT, an
inhibitor of <U+03B3>-secretase, reduced notch pathway activity, enhanced Atoh1
transcriptional activity, and dramatically increased the number of
Atoh1-expressing cells with hair cell features, but only in the
striolar/juxtastriolar region. Similar effects were seen with TAPI-1, an
inhibitor of another enzyme required for notch activity (TACE). Division of
supporting cells was rare in any control or DAPT-treated utricles. This study
shows that mature mammals have a natural capacity to initiate vestibular hair
cell regeneration and suggests that regional notch activity is a significant
inhibitor of direct transdifferentiation of supporting cells into hair cells
following damage.

Effects of DAPT and Atoh1 overexpression on hair cell production and hair bundle 
orientation in cultured Organ of Corti from neonatal rats.

Otolaryngology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.

BACKGROUND: In mammals, hair cells do not undergo spontaneous regeneration when
they are damaged and result in permanent hearing loss. Previous studies in
cultured Organ of Corti dissected from neonatal animals have shown that both DAPT
(r-secretase inhibitor in the Notch signal pathway) treatment and Atoh1
overexpression can induce supernumerary hair cells. The effects of simultaneous
DAPT treatment and Atoh1 over expression in the cells of cultured Organ of Corti 
from neonatal rats are still obscure.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we set out to investigate the interaction of
DAPT treatment and Atoh1 overexpression as well as culture time and the location 
of basilar fragment isolated form neonatal rat inner ear. Our results showed that
DAPT treatment induced more hair cells in the apical turn, while Atoh1
overexpression induced more extra hair cells in the middle turn of the cultured
Organ of Corti. When used together, their effects are additive but not
synergistic. In addition, the induction of supernumerary hair cells by both DAPT 
and Atoh1 overexpression is dependent on the treatment time and the location of
the cochlear tissue. Moreover, DAPT treatment causes dramatic changes in the
orientation of the stereociliary bundles of hair cells, whereas Atoh1
overexpression didn't induce drastic change of the polarity of stereociliary
bundles.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, these results suggest that DAPT
treatment are much more potent in inducing supernumerary hair cells than Atoh1
overexpression and that the new hair cells mainly come from the
trans-differentiation of supporting cells around hair cells. The orientation
change of stereociliary bundle of hair cells may be attributed to the insertion
of the newly formed hair cells. The immature hair bundles on the newly formed
hair cells may also contribute to the overall chaos of the stereociliary bundle
of the sensory epithelia.

Suppression of hath1 gene expression directly regulated by hes1 via notch
signaling is associated with goblet cell depletion in ulcerative colitis.

and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.

BACKGROUND: The transcription factor Atoh1/Hath1 plays crucial roles in the
differentiation program of human intestinal epithelium cells (IECs). Although
previous studies have indicated that the Notch signal suppresses the
differentiation program of IEC, the mechanism by which it does so remains
unknown. This study shows that the undifferentiated state is maintained by the
suppression of the Hath1 gene in human intestine.
METHODS: To assess the effect of Notch signaling, doxycycline-induced expression 
of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and Hes1 cells were generated in LS174T.
Hath1 gene expression was analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Hath1 promoter region targeted by HES1 was
determined by both reporter analysis and ChIP assay. Expression of Hath1 protein 
in ulcerative colitis (UC) was examined by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Hath1 mRNA expression was increased by Notch signal inhibition. However,
Hath1 expression was suppressed by ectopic HES1 expression alone even under Notch
signal inhibition. Suppression of the Hath1 gene by Hes1, which binds to the 5'
promoter region of Hath1, resulted in suppression of the phenotypic gene
expression for goblet cells. In UC, the cooperation of aberrant expression of
HES1 and the disappearance of caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) caused Hath1
suppression, resulting in goblet cell depletion.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that Hes1 is essential for Hath1 gene
suppression via Notch signaling. Moreover, the suppression of Hath1 is associated
with goblet cell depletion in UC. Understanding the regulation of goblet cell
depletion may lead to the development of new therapy for UC.

NOTCH Signaling and ATOH1 in Colorectal Cancers.

Hospital, MLC 2010, 3333 Burnet Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.

The Notch receptor signaling pathway regulates expression of the basic
helix-loop-helix transcription factor ATOH1 (Math1/Hath1) to determine cell fate 
in the intestine. In differentiating intestinal stem cells, high levels of Notch 
activity specify absorptive enterocyte/colonocyte differentiation, whereas high
ATOH1 activity specifies secretory (goblet, enteroendocrine, and Paneth) cell
differentiation. In colorectal cancer, ATOH1 is a tumor suppressor that is
silenced in most tumors, while Notch is oncogenic and often highly active in
human tumors. In other gastrointestinal malignancies with features of intestinal 
metaplasia, such as esophageal and gastric cancers, the Notch-ATOH1 pathway
becomes activated. In cancers and preneoplastic tissues that retain the ability
to activate ATOH1, therapeutic targeting of this pathway can be achieved by
inhibiting Notch activity (with Notch-targeting antibodies or small-molecule
inhibitors of <U+03B3>-secretase). Thus, targeting the Notch-ATOH1 pathway represents a 
novel approach to differentiation therapy in gastrointestinal cancers.

The POU-domain transcription POU4F3 is expressed in the sensory cells of the
inner ear. Expression begins shortly after commitment to the hair cell (HC) fate,
and continues throughout life. It is required for terminal HC differentiation and
survival. To explore regulation of the murine Pou4f3 gene, we linked enhanced
green fluorescent protein (eGFP) to 8.5 kb of genomic sequence 5' to the start
codon in transgenic mice. eGFP was uniformly present in all embryonic and
neonatal HCs. Expression of eGFP was also observed in developing Merkel cells and
olfactory neurons as well as adult inner and vestibular HCs, mimicking the normal
expression pattern of POU4F3 protein, with the exception of adult outer HCs.
Apparently ectopic expression was observed in developing inner ear neurons. On a 
Pou4f3 null background, the transgene produced expression in embryonic HCs which 
faded soon after birth both in vivo and in vitro. Pou4f3 null HCs treated with
caspase 3 and 9 inhibitors survived longer than untreated HCs, but still showed
reduced expression of eGFP. The results suggest the existence of separate
enhancers for different HC types, as well as strong autoregulation of the Pou4f3 
gene. Bioinformatic analysis of four divergent mammalian species revealed three
highly conserved regions within the transgene: 400 bp immediately 5' to the
Pou4f3 ATG, a short sequence at -1.3 kb, and a longer region at -8.2 to -8.5 kb. 
The latter contained E-box motifs that bind basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
transcription factors, including motifs activated by ATOH1. Cotransfection of
HEK293 or VOT-E36 cells with ATOH1 and the transgene as a reporter enhanced eGFP 
expression when compared with the transgene alone. Chromatin immunoprecipitation 
of the three highly conserved regions revealed binding of ATOH1 to the
distal-most conserved region. The results are consistent with regulation of
Pou4f3 in HCs by ATOH1 at a distal enhancer.

The pathogenesis of both entities of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), namely
Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is still complex and under
investigation. The importance of the microbial flora in developing IBD is beyond 
debate. In the last few years, the focus has changed from adaptive towards innate
immunity. Crohn's ileitis is associated with a deficiency of the antimicrobial
shield, as shown by a reduced expression and secretion of the Paneth cell
defensin HD5 and HD6, which is related to a Paneth cell differentiation defect
mediated by a diminished expression of the Wnt transcription factor TCF4. In UC, 
the protective mucus layer, acting as a physical and chemical barrier between the
gut epithelium and the luminal microbes, is thinner and in part denuded as
compared to controls. This could be caused by a missing induction of the goblet
cell differentiation factors Hath1 and KLF4 leading to immature goblet cells.
This defective Paneth and goblet cell differentiation in Crohn's ileitis and UC
may enable the luminal microbes to invade the mucosa and trigger the
inflammation. The exact molecular mechanisms behind ileal CD and also UC must be 
further clarified, but these observations could give rise to new therapeutic
strategies based on a stimulation of the protective innate immune system.

A multiparametric approach to monitor the effects of <U+03B3>-secretase inhibition along
the whole intestinal tract.

<U+03B3>-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) have been recently proposed as chemopreventive
agents in gastrointestinal neoplasia, because they lead, through inhibition of
the Notch signaling pathway, to goblet cell conversion in some intestinal
adenomas of the Apc(Min) mice, and halt epithelial cell proliferation. In this
study, we examine in depth, in normal mice, the effects of a GSI, dibenzazepine
(DBZ), intraperitoneally administered for 8 days at a non toxic dose, on the gene
expression pattern of secretory mucin (MUC), goblet cell conversion, organization
of the crypt structural-proliferative units, stem cell niche and apoptotic
compartments, along the entire length of the small intestine and colon. We
demonstrate that DBZ elicits a homogeneous goblet cell conversion all along the
mouse intestinal tract, associated with an overexpression of the gene Muc2
without ectopic expression of the gastric genes Muc5ac and Muc6, and with the
emergence of lysozyme-positive 'intermediate cells' in the colon. Furthermore,
DBZ treatment induces a heterogeneous reorganization of the crypt
structural-proliferative units along the intestinal tract and of the stem cell
niche in the colon, without disturbing the apoptotic compartment. These findings 
point to uncoupled effects of a GSI on goblet cell conversion and reorganization 
of the intestinal crypt structural-proliferative units and stem cell niche, and
suggest caution in the use of GSIs as chemopreventive agents for intestinal
neoplasia.

The postnatal accumulation of junctional E-cadherin is inversely correlated with 
the capacity for supporting cells to convert directly into sensory hair cells in 
mammalian balance organs.

Mammals experience permanent impairments from hair cell (HC) losses, but birds
and other non-mammals quickly recover hearing and balance senses after supporting
cells (SCs) give rise to replacement HCs. Avian HC epithelia express little or no
E-cadherin, and differences in the thickness of F-actin belts at SC junctions
strongly correlate with different species' capacities for HC replacement, so we
investigated junctional cadherins in human and murine ears. We found strong
E-cadherin expression at SC-SC junctions that increases more than sixfold
postnatally in mice. When we cultured utricles from young mice with <U+03B3>-secretase
inhibitors (GSIs), striolar SCs completely internalized their E-cadherin, without
affecting N-cadherin. Hes and Hey expression also decreased and the SCs began to 
express Atoh1. After 48 h, those SCs expressed myosins VI and VIIA, and by 72 h, 
they developed hair bundles. However, some scattered striolar SCs retained
E-cadherin and the SC phenotype. In extrastriolar regions, the vast majority of
SCs also retained E-cadherin and failed to convert into HCs even after long GSI
treatments. Microscopic measurements revealed that the junctions between
extrastriolar SCs were more developed than those between striolar SCs. In
GSI-treated utricles as old as P12, differentiated striolar SCs converted into
HCs, but such responses declined with age and ceased by P16. Thus, temporal and
spatial differences in postnatal SC-to-HC phenotype conversion capacity are
linked to the structural attributes of E-cadherin containing SC junctions in
mammals, which differ substantially from their counterparts in non-mammalian
vertebrates that readily recover from hearing and balance deficits through hair
cell regeneration.

Sox2 and Fgf interact with Atoh1 to promote sensory competence throughout the
zebrafish inner ear.

Sweet EM(1), Vemaraju S, Riley BB.

Author information: 
(1)Biology Department, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843-3258, USA.

Atoh1 is required for differentiation of sensory hair cells in the vertebrate
inner ear. Moreover, misexpression of Atoh1 is sufficient to establish ectopic
sensory epithelia, making Atoh1 a good candidate for gene therapy to restore
hearing. However, competence to form sensory epithelia appears to be limited to
discrete regions of the inner ear. To better understand the developmental factors
influencing sensory-competence, we examined the effects of misexpressing atoh1a
in zebrafish embryos under various developmental conditions. Activation of a heat
shock-inducible transgene, hs:atoh1a, resulted in ectopic expression of early
markers of sensory development within 2h, and mature hair cells marked by
brn3c:GFP began to accumulate 9h after heat shock. The ability of atoh1a to
induce ectopic sensory epithelia was maximal when activated during placodal or
early otic vesicle stages but declined rapidly thereafter. At no stage was atoh1a
sufficient to induce sensory development in dorsal or lateral non-sensory regions
of the otic vesicle. However, co-misexpression of atoh1a with fgf3, fgf8 or sox2,
genes normally acting in the same gene network with atoh1a, stimulated sensory
development in all regions of the otic vesicle. Thus, expression of fgf3, fgf8 or
sox2 strongly enhances competence to respond to Atoh1.

In vivo neuronal subtype-specific targets of Atoh1 (Math1) in dorsal spinal cord.

Dallas, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA.

Neural basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors are crucial in
regulating the differentiation and neuronal subtype specification of neurons.
Precisely how these transcription factors direct such processes is largely
unknown due to the lack of bona fide targets in vivo. Genetic evidence suggests
that bHLH factors have shared targets in their common differentiation role, but
unique targets with respect to their distinct roles in neuronal subtype
specification. However, whether neuronal subtype-specific targets exist remains
an unsolved question. To address this question, we focused on Atoh1 (Math1), a
bHLH transcription factor that specifies distinct neuronal subtypes of the
proprioceptive pathway in mammals including the dI1 (dorsal interneuron 1)
population of the developing spinal cord. We identified transcripts unique to the
Atoh1-derived lineage using microarray analyses of specific bHLH-sorted
populations from mouse. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing experiments
followed by enhancer reporter analyses identified five direct neuronal
subtype-specific targets of Atoh1 in vivo along with their Atoh1-responsive
enhancers. These targets, Klf7, Rab15, Rassf4, Selm, and Smad7, have diverse
functions that range from transcription factors to regulators of endocytosis and 
signaling pathways. Only Rab15 and Selm are expressed across several different
Atoh1-specified neuronal subtypes including external granule cells (external
granule cell layer) in the developing cerebellum, hair cells of the inner ear,
and Merkel cells. Our work establishes on a molecular level that neuronal
differentiation bHLH transcription factors have distinct lineage-specific
targets.

School of Medicine, Kansas City, Kansas 66160, USA.

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate the ability of the Ad28.gfap.atoh1 to promote 
hair cell regeneration and hearing recovery in cochlea injured with kanamycin and
furosemide.
STUDY DESIGN: In vivo model of hair cell ablation and subsequent treatment with
Atoh1.
METHODS: The hair cells of C57BL/6 mice were ablated with systemic administration
of kanamycin and furosemide. The left ears were treated with Ad28.gfap.atoh1. The
right ears were not treated. Preablation audiograms and distortion product
otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were compared to 1- or 2-month postablation
studies. Harvested cochleae were examined for histologic evidence of hair cell
regeneration and spiral ganglion cell survival.
RESULTS: Delivery of Ad28.gfap.atoh1 results in development of auditory hair
cells. There was no recovery of DPOAEs at 1 or 2 months post-treatment. Two
months after delivery of Ad28.gfap.atoh1, the left ear exhibited a moderate
recovery of hearing at 4 and 8 kHz (P < .01). There was no significant difference
at 16 or 32 kHz. One month after treatment, myosin VII-positive
immunohistochemical staining can be seen in both the inner and outer hair cells
of the treated ear. In the untreated ear, minimal myosin VII-positive debris is
seen, with no indication of normal hair cells. Two months after ablation, there
is evidence of hair cell recovery on the treated side, whereas the untreated
cochlea demonstrates a flattened epithelium. Untreated ears showed decreased
spiral ganglion cell density at the basal turn compared to treated ears.
CONCLUSIONS: Ad28.gfap.atoh1 promotes hair cell regeneration in cochlea ablated
with kanamycin and furosemide resulting in moderate hearing recovery.

OBJECTIVE: To clone the coding sequence of Atoh1 cDNA from SD rat and construct a
eukaryotic expression vector for its expression in eukaryotic cells.
METHODS: The total RNA was extracted from colonic mucosa of SD rats and the
double-stranded cDNA of Atoh1 was amplified using RT-PCR. The cDNA coding
sequence was then cloned into PMD-19T vector followed by sequence analysis. The
digested fragment, after purification, was linked into the eukaryotic expression 
vector pIRES2-EGFP containing the EGFP gene and the internal ribosomes site
(IRES). After identification by enzyme digestion and sequence analysis, the
recombinant plasmid was transfected into 293T cells via Lipofectamine, and the
expression of the target protein was detected under fluorescence microscope,
using PT-PCR and Western blotting.
RESULTS: DNA sequence analysis showed that the amplified rat Atoh1 gene, with a
length of 1056 bp of the coding sequence which encoded 351 amino acids, had two
base mutations compared to the reference sequences in GenBank, possibly as a
result of single nucleotide polymorphisms that induced nonsense mutation without 
affecting the amino acid sequences or the protein expression. The results of
enzyme digestion and sequence analysis demonstrated that the Atoh1 gene was
correctly inserted in the eukaryotic expression vector plRES2-EGFP. Fluorescence 
microscopy and Western blotting both confirmed successful expression of Atohl at 
the mRNA and protein levels in 293T cells 48 h after transfection with the
recombinant plasmid.
CONCLUSION: The recombinant plasmid harboring the coding sequence of SD rat Atoh1
gene has been constructed successfully and can be expressed in the 293T cells,
which provides a basis for functional study of Atoh1 gene and future researches
in gene therapy for sensorineural hearing loss.

The utricle is the enlarged portion of the membranous labyrinth of the inner ear 
and is essential for balance. It comprises of fine hair cells (mechanoreceptors),
supporting cells and calcareous otoliths. Utricle cells are considered to be
post-mitotic and possess a limited capacity for regeneration. Unlike birds and
reptiles, mammalian mechanosensory hair cells do not regenerate. The in vitro
culture of primary cells from the utricle and other inner ear structures of
mammals have proven difficult. Presented here for the first time is the culture
of primary cells derived from an explant of an adult human utricle, without any
intervention or manipulation. Cells were proliferative until cellular quiescence 
occurred during passage six. Cell morphology was atypical of epithelial cells,
appearing as a homogenous, slightly elongated population. Analysis of cultured
utricle cells by immunofluorescent staining (IF) and reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have shown these cells to possess epithelial
(Epithelium-specific ets-1 (ESE-1)), supporting hair cell (p27(Kip1)), and hair
cell specific (Atoh1 and Myosin VI) markers. Additionally, RT-PCR revealed
positive gene expression for the proliferation control marker fibroblast growth
factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and negative gene expression for E-cadherin (CDH1), a
vestibular cell differentiation marker.

Notch signaling alters sensory or neuronal cell fate specification of inner ear
stem cells.

(1)Department of Otology and Laryngology, Harvard Medical School, Boston,
Massachusetts 02115, USA.

Multipotent progenitor cells in the otic placode give rise to the specialized
cell types of the inner ear, including neurons, supporting cells, and hair cells.
The mechanisms governing acquisition of specific fates by the cells that form the
cochleovestibular organs remain poorly characterized. Here we show that whereas
blocking Notch signaling with a <U+03B3>-secretase inhibitor increased the conversion of
inner ear stem cells to hair cells by a mechanism that involved the upregulation 
of bHLH transcription factor, Math1 (mouse Atoh1), differentiation to a neuronal 
lineage was increased by expression of the Notch intracellular domain. The shift 
to a neuronal lineage could be attributed in part to continued cell proliferation
in cells that did not undergo sensory cell differentiation due to the high Notch 
signaling, but also involved upregulation of Ngn1. The Notch intracellular domain
influenced Ngn1 indirectly by upregulation of Sox2, a transcription factor
expressed in many neural progenitor cells, and directly by an interaction with an
RBP-J binding site in the Ngn1 promoter/enhancer. The induction of Ngn1 was
blocked partially by mutation of the RBP-J site and nearly completely when the
mutation was combined with inhibition of Sox2 expression. Thus, Notch signaling
had a significant role in the fate specification of neurons and hair cells from
inner ear stem cells, and decisions about cell fate were mediated in part by a
differential effect of combinatorial signaling by Notch and Sox2 on the
expression of bHLH transcription factors.

The long adventurous journey of rhombic lip cells in jawed vertebrates: a
comparative developmental analysis.

(1)Graduate School of Systemic Neurosciences and Department Biology II,

This review summarizes vertebrate rhombic lip and early cerebellar development
covering classic approaches up to modern developmental genetics which identifies 
the relevant differential gene expression domains and their progeny. Most of this
information is derived from amniotes. However, progress in anamniotes,
particularly in the zebrafish, has recently been made. The current picture
suggests that rhombic lip and cerebellar development in jawed vertebrates
(gnathostomes) share many characteristics. Regarding cerebellar development,
these include a ptf1a expressing ventral cerebellar proliferation (VCP) giving
rise to Purkinje cells and other inhibitory cerebellar cell types, and an atoh1
expressing upper rhombic lip giving rise to an external granular layer (EGL,
i.e., excitatory granule cells) and an early ventral migration into the anterior 
rhombencephalon (cholinergic nuclei). As for the lower rhombic lip (LRL),
gnathostome commonalities likely include the formation of precerebellar nuclei
(mossy fiber origins) and partially primary auditory nuclei (likely convergently 
evolved) from the atoh1 expressing dorsal zone. The fate of the ptf1a expressing 
ventral LRL zone which gives rise to (excitatory cells of) the inferior olive
(climbing fiber origin) and (inhibitory cells of ) cochlear nuclei in amniotes,
has not been determined in anamniotes. Special for the zebrafish in comparison to
amniotes is the predominant origin of anamniote excitatory deep cerebellar nuclei
homologs (i.e., eurydendroid cells) from ptf1a expressing VCP cells, the
sequential activity of various atoh1 paralogs and the incomplete coverage of the 
subpial cerebellar plate with proliferative EGL cells. Nevertheless, the
conclusion that a rhombic lip and its major derivatives evolved with gnathostome 
vertebrates only and are thus not an ancestral craniate character complex is
supported by the absence of a cerebellum (and likely absence of its afferent and 
efferent nuclei) in jawless fishes.

Numb modulates intestinal epithelial cells toward goblet cell phenotype by
inhibiting the Notch signaling pathway.

Numb was originally identified as an important cell fate determinant that is
asymmetrically inherited during mitosis and controls the fate of sibling cells by
inhibiting the Notch signaling pathway in neural tissue. The small intestinal
epithelium originates from the division of stem cells that reside in the crypt,
which further differentiate into goblet cells, absorptive cells, paneth cells,
and enteroendocrine cells. However, Numb's involvement in the differentiation
process of intestinal epithelium is largely unknown. In the present study, we
confirm that both the Numb mRNA and protein isoforms are expressed in adult mouse
intestinal mucosa. Numb protein is ubiquitously expressed throughout the
crypt-villus axis of the small intestinal epithelium and is mainly localized to
the cytoplasmic membrane. Down-regulation of endogenous Numb using RNA
interference in cultured intestinal LS174T cells increased Notch signaling,
leading to the up-regulation of Hes1 and the down-regulation of Hath1. Knockdown 
of Numb alleviated MUC2 protein expression and led to loss of the goblet cell
phenotype in LS174Tl cells. Our results provide the first evidence that Numb, an 
important cell fate determinant, modulates intestinal epithelial cells towards
the goblet cell phenotype by inhibiting the Notch signaling pathway.

Differentiation of postnatal cerebellar glial progenitors is controlled by Bmi1
through BMP pathway inhibition.

Bmi1 is a polycomb group (Pc-G) protein involved in heritable gene repression,
maintenance of cell identity, and proliferation. During the development of the
central nervous system, Bmi1 is crucial for self-renewal of neural stem cells and
for proliferation of neuronal (granule cell) progenitors of the cerebellum. Here,
we use loss of function mouse models and in vitro assays--granule cell cultures
and glial-neuronal co-cultures--to show that Bmi1 plays a crucial role in
specification of glial progenitors during postnatal cerebellar development.
Moreover, we demonstrate in in vitro assays that Bmi1 exerts this novel function 
through repression of BMP pathway and that this is independent of its known role 
in mediating the cellular response to Shh signaling. Thus modulation of Bmi1
expression in glial progenitors may represent a key event in determining the
differentiation potential of these cells.

Foetal breathing in mice results from prenatal activity of the two coupled
hindbrain oscillators considered to be responsible for respiratory rhythm
generation after birth: the pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) is active shortly
before the onset of foetal breathing; the parafacial respiratory group (e-pF in
embryo) starts activity one day earlier. Transcription factors have been
identified that are essential to specify neural progenitors and lineages forming 
each of these oscillators during early development of the neural tube: Hoxa1,
Egr2 (Krox20), Phox2b, Lbx1 and Atoh1 for the e-pF; Dbx1 and Evx1 for the preBötC
which eventually grow contralateral axons requiring expression of Robo3.
Inactivation of the genes encoding these factors leads to mis-specification of
these neurons and distinct breathing abnormalities: apneic patterns and loss of
central chemosensitivity for the e-pF (central congenital hypoventilation
syndrome, CCHS, in humans), complete loss of breathing for the preBötC,
right-left desynchronized breathing in Robo3 mutants. Mutations affecting
development in more rostral (pontine) respiratory territories change the shape of
the inspiratory drive without affecting the rhythm. Other (primordial) embryonic 
oscillators start in the mouse three days before the e-pF, to generate low
frequency (LF) rhythms that are probably required for activity-dependent
development of neurones at embryonic stages; in the foetus, however, they are
actively silenced to avoid detrimental interaction with the on-going respiratory 
rhythm. Altogether, these observations provide a strong support to the previously
proposed hypothesis that the functional organization of the respiratory generator
is specified at early stages of development and is dual in nature, comprising two
serially non-homologous oscillators.

Identification of genes concordantly expressed with Atoh1 during inner ear
development.

Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.

The inner ear is composed of a cochlear duct and five vestibular organs in which 
mechanosensory hair cells play critical roles in receiving and relaying sound and
balance signals to the brain. To identify novel genes associated with hair cell
differentiation or function, we analyzed an archived gene expression dataset from
embryonic mouse inner ear tissues. Since atonal homolog 1a (Atoh1) is a well
known factor required for hair cell differentiation, we searched for genes
expressed in a similar pattern with Atoh1 during inner ear development. The list 
from our analysis includes many genes previously reported to be involved in hair 
cell differentiation such as Myo6, Tecta, Myo7a, Cdh23, Atp6v1b1, and Gfi1. In
addition, we identified many other genes that have not been associated with hair 
cell differentiation, including Tekt2, Spag6, Smpx, Lmod1, Myh7b, Kif9, Ttyh1,
Scn11a and Cnga2. We examined expression patterns of some of the newly identified
genes using real-time polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization. For
example, Smpx and Tekt2, which are regulators for cytoskeletal dynamics, were
shown specifically expressed in the hair cells, suggesting a possible role in
hair cell differentiation or function. Here, by reanalyzing archived genetic
profiling data, we identified a list of novel genes possibly involved in hair
cell differentiation.

vestibular disease.

Loss of balance is often due to loss of vestibular hair cells. In mammals,
regeneration of functional hair cells in the mature sensory epithelium is
limited; therefore, loss of sensory cells can lead to debilitating balance
problems. Delivery of the transcription factor atonal (atoh1) after
aminoglycoside ototoxicity has previously been shown to induce the
transdifferentiation of supporting cells into new hair cells and restore
function. A problem with mouse aminoglycoside models is that the partial loss of 
hair cells seen in human disease is difficult to establish consistently. To more 
closely mirror human clinical balance dysfunction, we have used systemic
application of 3,3'-iminodipropionitrile (IDPN), a vestibulotoxic nitrile
compound known to cause vestibular hair cell loss, to induce a consistent partial
loss of vestibular hair cells. To determine if balance function could be
restored, we delivered atoh1 using a new adenovirus vector, based on Ad28. The
Ad28 adenovector is based on a human serotype with a low seroprevalence that
appears to target gene delivery to vestibular supporting cells. To further
provide cell type selectivity of gene delivery, we expressed atoh1 using the
supporting cell-specific glial fibrillary acid protein promoter. Delivery of this
vector to IDPN-damaged vestibular organs resulted in a significant recovery of
vestibular hair cells and restoration of balance, as measured by time on rotarod 
compared with untreated controls.

Genes expressed in Atoh1 neuronal lineages arising from the r1/isthmus rhombic
lip.

Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA. robert.machold@nyumc.org

During embryogenesis, the rhombic lip of the fourth ventricle is the germinal
origin of a diverse collection of neuronal populations that ultimately reside in 
the brainstem and cerebellum. Rhombic lip neurogenesis requires the bHLH
transcription factor Atoh1 (Math1), and commences shortly after neural tube
closure (E9.5). Within the rhombomere 1-isthmus region, the rhombic lip first
produces brainstem and deep cerebellar neurons (E9.5-E12), followed by granule
cell precursors after E12. While Atoh1 function is essential for all of these
populations to be specified, the downstream genetic programs that confer specific
properties to early and late born Atoh1 lineages are not well characterized. We
have performed a comparative microarray analysis of gene expression within early 
and later born cohorts of Atoh1 expressing neural precursors purified from E14.5 
embryos using a transgenic labeling strategy. We identify novel transcription
factors, cell surface molecules, and cell cycle regulators within each pool of
Atoh1 lineages that likely contribute to their distinct developmental
trajectories and cell fates. In particular, our analysis reveals new insights
into the genetic programs that regulate the specification and proliferation of
granule cell precursors, the putative cell of origin for the majority of
medulloblastomas.

Spatially restricted and developmentally dynamic expression of engrailed genes in
multiple cerebellar cell types.

York, NY 10065, USA.

The cerebellum is a highly organized structure partitioned into lobules along the
anterior-posterior (A-P) axis and into striped molecular domains along the
medial-lateral (M-L) axis. The Engrailed (En) homeobox genes are required for
patterning the morphological and molecular domains along both axes, as well as
for the establishment of the normal afferent topography required to generate a
fully functional cerebellum. As a means to understand how the En genes regulate
multiple levels of cerebellum construction, we characterized En1 and En2
expression around birth and at postnatal day (P) 21 during the period when the
cerebellum undergoes a remarkable transformation from a smooth ovoid structure to
a highly foliated structure. We show that both En1 and En2 are expressed in many 
neuronal cell types in the cerebellum, and expression persists until at least
P21. En1 and En2 expression, however, undergoes profound changes in their
cellular and spatial distributions between embryonic stages and P21, and their
expression domains become largely distinct. Comparison of the distribution of
En-expressing Purkinje cells relative to early- and late-onset Purkinje cell M-L 
stripe proteins revealed that although En1- and En2-expressing Purkinje cell
domains do not strictly align with those of ZEBRINII at P21, a clear pattern
exists that is most evident at E17.5 by an inverse correlation between the level 
of En2 expression and PLCß4 and EPHA4.

The vertebrate inner ear contains multiple sensory patches comprised of hair
cells and supporting cells. During development these sensory patches arise from
prosensory cells that are specified and maintained through the expression of
specific molecular factors. Disruption of Jagged1-mediated notch signaling causes
a loss of some sensory patches and disruptions in others, indicating a role in
some aspect of prosensory development. However, the presence of some sensory
patches suggests that some level of notch activity persists in the absence of
Jagged1. Therefore, the transcription factor Rbpj, which is required for nearly
all notch function, was deleted in the developing otocyst. Results indicate a
nearly complete absence of all prosensory patches in the inner ear with remaining
hair cells located predominantly in the extreme apex of the cochlea. However,
early markers of prosensory cells are still present in Rbpj-mutants, suggesting
that maintenance, rather than induction, of prosensory development is dependent
on notch signaling. Moreover, analysis of developing cochleae in Rbpj-mutants
indicates changes in the spatiotemporal patterns of expression for p27(kip1),
Atoh1 and hair cell differentiation markers implicating notch signaling in the
regulation of the timing of cellular differentiation and/or in the maintenance of
a stem/progenitor cell stage. Finally, the absence of Rbpj caused increased cell 
death in the cochlea beginning at E12. These results suggest important roles for 
Rbpj and notch signaling in multiple aspects of inner ear development including
prosensory cell maturation, cellular differentiation and survival.

Distinct ATOH1 and Neurog3 requirements define tuft cells as a new secretory cell
type in the intestinal epithelium.

Shroyer NF, Bourgaux JF, Pignodel C, Clevers H, Jay P.

The unique morphology of tuft cells was first revealed by electron microscopy
analyses in several endoderm-derived epithelia. Here, we explore the relationship
of these cells with the other cell types of the intestinal epithelium and
describe the first marker signature allowing their unambiguous identification. We
demonstrate that although mature tuft cells express DCLK1, a putative marker of
quiescent stem cells, they are post-mitotic, short lived, derive from
Lgr5-expressing epithelial stem cells, and are found in mouse and human tumors.
We show that whereas the ATOH1/MATH1 transcription factor is essential for their 
differentiation, Neurog3, SOX9, GFI1, and SPDEF are dispensable, which
distinguishes these cells from enteroendocrine, Paneth, and goblet cells, and
raises from three to four the number of secretory cell types in the intestinal
epithelium. Moreover, we show that tuft cells are the main source of endogenous
intestinal opioids and are the only epithelial cells that express cyclooxygenase 
enzymes, suggesting important roles for these cells in the intestinal epithelium 
physiopathology.

MicroRNA-183 family expression in hair cell development and requirement of
microRNAs for hair cell maintenance and survival.

Soukup GA.

Author information:

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) post-transcriptionally repress complementary target gene
expression and can contribute to cell differentiation. The coordinate expression 
of miRNA-183 family members (miR-183, miR-96, and miR-182) has been demonstrated 
in sensory cells of the mouse inner ear and other vertebrate sensory organs. To
further examine hair cell miRNA expression in the mouse inner ear, we have
analyzed miR-183 family expression in wild type animals and various mutants with 
defects in neurosensory development. miR-183 family member expression follows
neurosensory cell specification, exhibits longitudinal (basal-apical) gradients
in maturating cochlear hair cells, and is maintained in sensory neurons and most 
hair cells into adulthood. Depletion of hair cell miRNAs resulting from Dicer1
conditional knockout (CKO) in Atoh1-Cre transgenic mice leads to more disparate
basal-apical gene expression profiles and eventual hair cell loss. Results
suggest that hair cell miRNAs subdue cochlear gradient gene expression and are
required for hair cell maintenance and survival.

The UNC5C netrin receptor regulates dorsal guidance of mouse hindbrain axons.

Kim D(1), Ackerman SL.

Author information: 
(1)Howard Hughes Medical Institute and The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine 
04609, USA.

The cerebellum receives its input from multiple precerebellar nuclei located in
the brainstem and sends processed information to other brain structures via the
deep cerebellar neurons. Guidance molecules that regulate the complex migrations 
of precerebellar neurons and the initial guidance of their leading processes have
been identified. However, the molecules necessary for dorsal guidance of
precerebellar axons to the developing cerebellum or for guidance of decussating
axons of the deep nuclei are not known. To determine whether Unc5c plays a role
in the dorsal guidance of precerebellar and deep cerebellar axons, we studied
axonal trajectories of these neurons in Unc5c(-/-) mice. Our results show that
Unc5c is expressed broadly in the precerebellar and deep cerebellar neurons.
Unc5c deletion disrupted long-range dorsal guidance of inferior olivary and
pontine axons after crossing the midline. In addition, dorsal guidance of the
axons from the medial deep cerebellar and external cuneate neurons was affected
in Unc5c(-/-) mice, as were anterior migrations of pontine neurons. Coincident
with the guidance defects of their axons, degeneration of neurons in the external
cuneate nucleus and subdivisions of the inferior olivary nucleus was observed in 
Unc5c(-/-) mice. Lastly, transgenic expression of Unc5c in deep neurons and
pontine neurons by the Atoh1 promoter rescued defects of the medial deep
cerebellar and pontine axons observed in Unc5c(-/-) embryos, demonstrating that
Unc5c acts cell autonomously in the guidance of these axons. Our results suggest 
that Unc5c plays a broad role in dorsal guidance of axons in the developing
hindbrain.

In vivo Atoh1 targetome reveals how a proneural transcription factor regulates
cerebellar development.

Institute, The Dan L Duncan Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston,
TX 77030, USA.

The proneural, basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Atoh1 governs the
development of numerous key neuronal subtypes, such as cerebellar granule and
brainstem neurons, inner ear hair cells, and several neurons of the
proprioceptive system, as well as diverse nonneuronal cell types, such as Merkel 
cells and intestinal secretory lineages. However, the mere handful of targets
that have been identified barely begin to account for Atoh1's astonishing range
of functions, which also encompasses seemingly paradoxical activities, such as
promoting cell proliferation and medulloblastoma formation in the cerebellum and 
inducing cell cycle exit and suppressing tumorigenesis in the intestine. We used 
a multipronged approach to create a comprehensive, unbiased list of over 600
direct Atoh1 target genes in the postnatal cerebellum. We found that Atoh1 binds 
to a 10 nucleotide motif (AtEAM) to directly regulate genes involved in
migration, cell adhesion, metabolism, and other previously unsuspected functions.
This study expands current thinking about the transcriptional activities driving 
neuronal differentiation and provides a framework for further neurodevelopmental 
studies.

Genetic evidence that intestinal Notch functions vary regionally and operate
through a common mechanism of Math1 repression.

Kim TH(1), Shivdasani RA.

(1)Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and
Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.

Notch signaling is active in many sites, and its diverse activities must require 
tissue-specific intermediaries, which are largely unknown. In the intestinal
epithelium, Notch promotes crypt cell proliferation and inhibits goblet cell
differentiation. Pharmacologic studies suggest that the latter effect occurs
through the transcription factor Math1/Atoh1, which specifies all intestinal
secretory cells. We tested this hypothesis using mouse mutants. Genetic loss of
the Notch effector RBP-J<U+03BA> alone increases all intestinal secretory lineages, with
variation between proximal and distal gut segments. This secretory cell excess
observed with RBP-J<U+03BA> loss was blocked in the absence of Math1 in
RBP-J<U+03BA>(Fl/Fl);Math1(Fl/Fl);Villin-Cre((ER-T2)) mice. Loss of both factors also
restored progenitor replication, proving that Math1 is epistatic to Notch
signaling in both secretory cell differentiation and crypt cell proliferation.
Investigating mechanisms downstream of Math1, we found that expression of the
known Notch effector protein Hes1 was predictably lost in RBP-J<U+03BA>(-/-) mice but
surprisingly recovered in RBP-J<U+03BA>;Math1 compound conditional mutants. Furthermore,
the cell cycle inhibitors p27(Kip1) and p57(Kip2) were selectively overexpressed 
in duodenal and ileal crypts, respectively, in RBP-J<U+03BA>-deficient mice. Regional
activation of these products was completely abrogated in the absence of Math1.
Thus, all intestinal Notch effects channel through the tissue-restricted factor
Math1, which promotes secretory differentiation and cell cycle exit by regionally
distinct mechanisms. Our data further suggest that, besides transmitting Notch
signals, the transcription factor Hes1 acts downstream of Math1 to regulate
expression of cell cycle inhibitors and intestinal crypt cell replication.

Jagged 1 regulates the restriction of Sox2 expression in the developing chicken
inner ear: a mechanism for sensory organ specification.

Hair cells of the inner ear sensory organs originate from progenitor cells
located at specific domains of the otic vesicle: the prosensory patches. Notch
signalling is necessary for sensory development and loss of function of the Notch
ligand jagged 1 (Jag1, also known as serrate 1) results in impaired sensory
organs. However, the underlying mechanism of Notch function is unknown. Our
results show that in the chicken otic vesicle, the Sox2 expression domain
initially contains the nascent patches of Jag1 expression but, later on, Sox2 is 
only maintained in the Jag1-positive domains. Ectopic human JAG1 (hJag1) is able 
to induce Sox2 expression and enlarged sensory organs. The competence to respond 
to hJag1, however, is confined to the regions that expressed Sox2 early in
development, suggesting that hJag1 maintains Sox2 expression rather than inducing
it de novo. The effect is non-cell-autonomous and requires Notch signalling.
hJag1 activates Notch, induces Hes/Hey genes and endogenous Jag1 in a
non-cell-autonomous manner, which is consistent with lateral induction. The
effects of hJag1 are mimicked by Jag2 but not by Dl1. Sox2 is sufficient to
activate the Atoh1 enhancer and to ectopically induce sensory cell fate outside
neurosensory-competent domains. We suggest that the prosensory function of Jag1
resides in its ability to generate discrete domains of Notch activity that
maintain Sox2 expression within restricted areas of an extended
neurosensory-competent domain. This provides a mechanism to couple patterning and
cell fate specification during the development of sensory organs.

Neural stem cells have been identified in multiple parts of the postnatal
mammalian brain, as well as in the inner ear. No investigation of potential
neural stem cells in the cochlear nucleus has yet been performed. The aim of this
study was to investigate potential neural stem cells from the cochlear nucleus by
neurosphere assay and in histological sections to prove their capacity for
self-renewal and for differentiation into progenitor cells and cells of the
neuronal lineage. For this purpose, cells of the cochlear nucleus of postnatal
day 6 rats were isolated and cultured for generation of primary neurospheres.
Spheres were dissociated and cells analyzed for capacity for mitosis and
differentiation. Cell division was detected by cell-counting assay and BrdU
incorporation. Differentiated neural progenitor cells showed distinct labeling
for Nestin and for Atoh1. Positive staining of ß-III Tubulin, glial fibrillary
acid protein (GFAP) and myelin basic protein (MBP) showed differentiation into
neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, Nestin- and BrdU-labeled
cells could also be detected in histological sections. In conclusion, the
isolated cells from the cochlear nucleus presented all the features of neural
stem cells: cell division, presence of progenitor cells and differentiation into 
different cells of the neuronal lineage. The existence of neural stem cells may
add to the understanding of developmental features in the cochlear nucleus.

Dissecting the molecular basis of organ of Corti development: Where are we now?

This review summarizes recent progress in our understanding of the molecular
basis of cochlear duct growth, specification of the organ of Corti, and
differentiation of the different types of hair cells. Studies of multiple
mutations suggest that developing hair cells are involved in stretching the organ
of Corti through convergent extension movements. However, Atoh1 null mutants have
only undifferentiated and dying organ of Corti precursors but show a near normal 
extension of the cochlear duct, implying that organ of Corti precursor cells can 
equally drive this process. Some factors influence cochlear duct growth by
regulating the cell cycle and proliferation. Shortened cell cycle and premature
cell cycle exit can lead to a shorter organ of Corti with multiple rows of hair
cells (e.g., Foxg1 null mice). Other genes affect the initial formation of a
cochlear duct with or without affecting the organ of Corti. Such observations are
consistent with evolutionary data that suggest some developmental uncoupling of
cochlear duct from organ of Corti formation. Positioning the organ of Corti
requires multiple genes expressed in the organ of Corti and the flanking region. 
Several candidate factors have emerged but how they cooperate to specify the
organ of Corti and the topology of hair cells remains unclear. Atoh1 is required 
for differentiation of all hair cells, but regulation of inner versus outer hair 
cell differentiation is still unidentified. In summary, the emerging molecular
complexity of organ of Corti development demands further study before a rational 
approach towards regeneration of unique types of hair cells in specific positions
is possible.

Complex interplay between ß-catenin signalling and Notch effectors in intestinal 
tumorigenesis.

AIMS: The activation of ß-catenin signalling is a key step in intestinal
tumorigenesis. Interplay between the ß-catenin and Notch pathways during
tumorigenesis has been reported, but the mechanisms involved and the role of
Notch remain unclear.
METHODS: Notch status was analysed by studying expression of the Notch effector
Hes1 and Notch ligands/receptors in human colorectal cancer (CRC) and mouse
models of Apc mutation. A genetic approach was used, deleting the Apc and RBP-J
or Atoh1 genes in murine intestine. CRC cell lines were used to analyse the
control of Hes1 and Atoh1 by ß-catenin signalling.
RESULTS: Notch signalling was found to be activated downstream from ß-catenin. It
was rapidly induced and maintained throughout tumorigenesis. Hes1 induction was
mediated by ß-catenin and resulted from both the induction of the Notch
ligand/receptor and Notch-independent control of the Hes1 promoter by ß-catenin. 
Surprisingly, the strong phenotype of unrestricted proliferation and impaired
differentiation induced by acute Apc deletion in the intestine was not rescued by
conditional Notch inactivation. Hyperactivation of ß-catenin signalling overrode 
the forced differention induced by Notch inhibition, through the downregulation
of Atoh1, a key secretory determinant factor downstream of Notch. This process
involves glycogen synthase kinase 3 ß (GSK3ß) and proteasome-mediated
degradation. The restoration of Atoh1 expression in CRC cell lines displaying
ß-catenin activation was sufficient to increase goblet cell differentiation,
whereas genetic ablation of Atoh1 greatly increased tumour formation in Apc
mutant mice.
CONCLUSION: Notch signalling is a downstream target of ß-catenin hyperactivation 
in intestinal tumorigenesis. However, its inhibition had no tumour suppressor
effect in the context of acute ß-catenin activation probably due to the
downregulation of Atoh1. This finding calls into question the use of <U+03B3>-secretase 
inhibitors for the treatment of CRC and suggests that the restoration of Atoh1
expression in CRC should be considered as a therapeutic approach.

Atonal homolog1 (Atoh1, formerly Math1) is a crucial bHLH transcription factor
for inner ear hair cell differentiation. Its absence in embryos results in
complete absence of mature hair cells at birth and its misexpression can generate
extra hair cells. Thus Atoh1 may be both necessary and sufficient for hair cell
differentiation in the ear. Atoh1 null mice die at birth and have some
undifferentiated cells in sensory epithelia carrying Atoh1 markers. The fate of
these undifferentiated cells in neonates is unknown due to lethality. We use
Tg(Pax2-Cre) to delete floxed Atoh1 in the inner ear. This generates viable
conditional knockout (CKO) mice for studying the postnatal development of the
inner ear without differentiated hair cells. Using in situ hybridization we find 
that Tg(Pax2-Cre) recombines the floxed Atoh1 prior to detectable Atoh1
expression. Only the posterior canal crista has Atoh1 expressing hair cells due
to incomplete recombination. Most of the organ of Corti cells are lost in CKO
mice via late embryonic cell death. Marker genes indicate that the organ of Corti
is reduced to two rows of cells wedged between flanking markers of the organ of
Corti (Fgf10 and Bmp4). These two rows of cells (instead of five rows of
supporting cells) are positive for Prox1 in neonates. By postnatal day 14 (P14), 
the remaining cells of the organ of Corti are transformed into a flat epithelium 
with no distinction of any specific cell type. However, some of the remaining
organ of Corti cells express Myo7a at late postnatal stages and are innervated by
remaining afferent fibers. Initial growth of afferents and efferents in embryos
shows no difference between control mice and Tg(Pax2-Cre)::Atoh1 CKO mice. Most
afferents and efferents are lost in the CKO mutant before birth, except for the
apex and few fibers in the base. Afferents focus their projections on patches
that express the prosensory specifying gene, Sox2. This pattern of innervation by
sensory neurons is maintained at least until P14, but fibers target the few Myo7a
positive cells found in later stages.

Mammalian cochlear hair cells don't regenerate naturally after injury, which
usually leave permanent hearing loss. Math1 gene is a positive regulator of hair 
cell differentiation during cochlear development and was proved to be very
critical in hair cell regeneration in deaf animals. Generating new cochlear hair 
cells by forced Math1 expression may be a cure for hearing loss. However,
satisfying gene delivering vectors in gene therapy are not available. We combined
quaternized chitosan (QCS) with Na-carboxymethyl-beta-cyclodextrin (CM-beta-CD)
as novel non-viral vector, which adsorbs pRK5-Math1-EGFP perfectly at the mass
ratio of 4:1. In vitro cell transfection can reach a 40% transfect efficiency and
relatively low cytotoxity than liposomes. These results suggest that
QCS/CM-beta-CD nanoparticle complexes could be a novel non-viral gene carrier in 
further clinical application.

BACKGROUND: Double balloon endoscopy (DBE) enables the observation and collection
of viable specimens from the entire intestine, thereby allowing more detailed
investigation of how the structure and function of the human small intestine are 
regulated. The present study aimed to elucidate the regulation of cell formation 
in the human small intestine using biopsy specimens collected from an entire
individual small intestine by DBE.
METHODS: The expression and the localization of representative genes for the
differentiation program were analyzed in the entire small intestine of 10
patients. The functional correlation between Hath1 and Klf4 was analyzed in an
intestinal cell line by using a Tet-On system.
RESULTS: In longitudinal cell formation in the small intestine, it was shown that
goblet cells, but not Paneth cells, increased toward the ileum in each individual
small intestine. Immunohistochemistry showed that Hath1-expressing cells migrated
from the base of the crypt to the top of the villi in the terminal ileum, while
Klf4-expressing cells migrated from the top of the villus, resulting in the
colocalization of Hath1 and Klf4 in the terminal ileum. Coexpression of Hath1 and
Klf4 upregulated the expression of phenotypic genes for goblet cells following
the downregulation of those for Paneth cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Using mapping biopsy by DBE, we have demonstrated, for the first
time, the molecular basis of the villus structure in the entire human small
intestine in vivo. The present study showed that longitudinal cell formation was 
regulated by the colocalization of Hath1 and Klf4 that converted Paneth cell
differentiation into goblet cell differentiation.

In mammals, fetal movements governed by central pattern generators are essential 
for the development of adaptive behaviors such as breathing, walking, and
chewing, which are vital after birth. Combining targeted mutations and genetic
fate mapping can help to define the molecular determinants that control the
development of these central pattern generators. In this chapter, recent results 
are presented on the embryonic parafacial (e-pF) rhythm generator, one of the two
oscillators involved in controlling the breathing behavior and chemosensitive
responsiveness.

Molecular characterization of the mouse superior lateral parabrachial nucleus
through expression of the transcription factor Runx1.

Zagami CJ(1), Stifani S.

Author information: 
(1)Centre for Neuronal Survival, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill
University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

BACKGROUND: The ability to precisely identify separate neuronal populations is
essential to the understanding of the development and function of different brain
structures. This necessity is particularly evident in regions such as the
brainstem, where the anatomy is quite complex and little is known about the
identity, origin, and function of a number of distinct nuclei due to the lack of 
specific cellular markers. In this regard, the gene encoding the transcription
factor Runx1 has emerged as a specific marker of restricted neuronal populations 
in the murine central and peripheral nervous systems. The aim of this study was
to precisely characterize the expression of Runx1 in the developing and postnatal
mouse brainstem.
METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Anatomical and immunohistochemical studies were
used to characterize mouse Runx1 expression in the brainstem. It is shown here
that Runx1 is expressed in a restricted population of neurons located in the
dorsolateral rostral hindbrain. These neurons define a structure that is
ventromedial to the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, dorsocaudal to the
medial paralemniscal nucleus and rostral to the cerebellum. Runx1 expression in
these cells is first observed at approximately gestational day 12.5, persists
into the adult brain, and is lost in knockout mice lacking the transcription
factor Atoh1, an important regulator of the development of neuronal lineages of
the rhombic lip. Runx1-expressing neurons in the rostral hindbrain produce
cholecystokinin and also co-express members of the Groucho/Transducin-like
Enhancer of split protein family.
CONCLUSION: Based on the anatomical and molecular characteristics of the
Runx1-expressing cells in the rostral hindbrain, we propose that Runx1 expression
in this region of the mouse brain defines the superior lateral parabrachial
nucleus.

Intestinal stem cells lacking the Math1 tumour suppressor are refractory to Notch
inhibitors.

Intestinal cells are constantly produced from a stem cell reservoir that gives
rise to proliferating transient amplifying cells, which subsequently
differentiate into one of the four principal cell types. Signalling pathways,
including the Notch signalling pathway, coordinate these differentiation
processes and their deregulation may cause cancer. Pharmacological inhibition
through <U+03B3>-secretase inhibitors or genetic inactivation of the Notch signalling
pathway results in the complete loss of proliferating crypt progenitors due to
their conversion into post-mitotic goblet cells. The basic helix-loop-helix
transcription factor Math1 is essential for intestinal secretory cell
differentiation. Because of the critical roles of both Math1 and Notch signalling
in intestinal homeostasis and neoplastic transformation, we sought to determine
the genetic hierarchy regulating the differentiation of intestinal stem cells
into secretory cells. In this paper, we demonstrate that the conversion of
intestinal stem cells into goblet cells upon inhibition of the Notch signalling
pathway requires Math1.

RBP-J is not required for granule neuron progenitor development and
medulloblastoma initiated by Hedgehog pathway activation in the external germinal
layer.

Julian E(1), Hallahan AR, Wainwright BJ.

Author information: 
(1)Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland, Brisbane,
Australia.

BACKGROUND: The Notch signalling pathway plays crucial roles in neural
development, functioning by preventing premature differentiation and promotion of
glial cell fates. In the developing cerebellum Notch pathway components are
expressed in granule neuron progenitors of the external germinal layer (EGL) but 
the precise function of Notch in these cells is unclear. The Hedgehog pathway is 
also crucial in cerebellar development, mainly via control of the cell cycle, and
persistent activation of the pathways leads to the cerebellar tumour
medulloblastoma. Interactions between Hedgehog and Notch have been reported in
normal brain development as well as in Hedgehog pathway induced medulloblastoma
but the molecular details of this interaction are not known and we investigate
here the role of Notch signalling in the development of the EGL and the
intersection between the two pathways in cerebellar granule neuron progenitors
and in medulloblastoma.
RESULTS: RBP-J is the major downstream effector of all four mammalian Notch
receptors and the RBP-J conditional mouse facilitates inactivation of canonical
Notch signals. Patched1 is a negative regulator of Hedgehog signalling and the
Patched1 conditional mouse is widely used to activate Hedgehog signalling via
Patched1 deletion in specific cell types. The conditional mouse lines were
crossed with a Math1-Cre line to delete the two genes in granule neuron
progenitors from embryonic day 10.5. While deletion of only Patched1 as well as
Patched1 together with RBP-J leads to formation of medulloblastoma concomitant
with disorganisation of cell layers, loss of RBP-J from granule neuron
progenitors has no obvious effect on overall cerebellar morphology or
differentiation and maturation of the different cerebellar cell types.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that even though Notch signalling has been shown
to play important roles in cerebellar development, signalling via RBP-J is
surprisingly not required in granule neuron progenitors. Furthermore, RBP-J
inactivation in these cells does not influence the formation of medulloblastoma
initiated by Hedgehog pathway activation. This may suggest a requirement of Notch
in cerebellar development at a different developmental stage or in a different
cell type than examined here - for example, in the neural stem cells of the
ventricular zone. In addition, it remains a possibility that, in granule neuron
progenitors, Notch may signal via an alternative pathway without the requirement 
for RBP-J.

Id gene regulation and function in the prosensory domains of the chicken inner
ear: a link between Bmp signaling and Atoh1.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps) regulate the expression of the proneural gene 
Atoh1 and the generation of hair cells in the developing inner ear. The present
work explored the role of Inhibitor of Differentiation genes (Id1-3) in this
process. The results show that Id genes are expressed in the prosensory domains
of the otic vesicle, along with Bmp4 and Bmp7. Those domains exhibit high levels 
of the phosphorylated form of Bmp-responding R-Smads (P-Smad1,5,8), and of
Bmp-dependent Smad transcriptional activity as shown by the BRE-tk-EGFP reporter.
Increased Bmp signaling induces the expression of Id1-3 along with the inhibition
of Atoh1. Conversely, the Bmp antagonist Noggin or the Bmp-receptor inhibitor
Dorsomorphin elicit opposite effects, indicating that Bmp signaling is necessary 
for Id expression and Atoh1 regulation in the otocyst. The forced expression of
Id3 is sufficient to reduce Atoh1 expression and to prevent the expression of
hair cell differentiation markers. Together, these results suggest that Ids are
part of the machinery that mediates the regulation of hair cell differentiation
exerted by Bmps. In agreement with that, during hair cell differentiation Bmp4
expression, P-Smad1,5,8 levels and Id expression are downregulated from hair
cells. However, Ids are also downregulated from the supporting cells which
contrarily to hair cells exhibit high levels of Bmp4 expression, P-Smad1,5,8, and
BRE-tk-EGFP activity, suggesting that in these cells Ids escape from Bmp/Smad
signaling. The differential regulation of Ids in time and space may underlie the 
multiple functions of Bmp signaling during sensory organ development.

Mouse atonal homolog 1 directs intestinal progenitors to secretory cell rather
than absorptive cell fate.

VanDussen KL(1), Samuelson LC.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, The University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.

The Notch-regulated transcription factor mouse atonal homolog 1 (Math1) is
required for the development of intestinal secretory cells, as demonstrated by
the loss of goblet, endocrine and Paneth cell types in null mice. However, it was
unknown whether Math1 is sufficient to induce the program of secretory cell
differentiation. To examine the function of Math1 in the differentiation of
intestinal epithelial cells, intestinal morphology and epithelial and mesenchymal
cell fate were examined by histological staining and marker gene expression in
transgenic mice expressing a villin-regulated Math1 transgene. Late prenatal
transgenic founders exhibited a gross cellular transformation into a secretory
epithelium. The expansion of secretory cells coupled with the almost complete
loss of absorptive enterocytes suggested reprogramming of a bipotential
progenitor cell. Moreover, Math1 expression inhibited epithelial cell
proliferation, as demonstrated by a marked reduction in Ki67 positive cells and
blunted villi. Unexpectedly, the transgenic mesenchyme was greatly expanded with 
increased proliferation. Several mesenchymal cell types were amplified, including
smooth muscle and neurons, with maintenance of basic radial patterning. Since
transgenic Math1 expression was restricted to the epithelium, these findings
suggest that epithelial-mesenchymal signaling is altered by the cellular changes 
induced by Math1. Thus, Math1 is a key effector directing multipotential
precursors to adopt secretory and not absorptive cell fate.

Neurod1 suppresses hair cell differentiation in ear ganglia and regulates hair
cell subtype development in the cochlea.

Jahan I(1), Pan N, Kersigo J, Fritzsch B.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, United States of
America.

BACKGROUND: At least five bHLH genes regulate cell fate determination and
differentiation of sensory neurons, hair cells and supporting cells in the
mammalian inner ear. Cross-regulation of Atoh1 and Neurog1 results in hair cell
changes in Neurog1 null mice although the nature and mechanism of the
cross-regulation has not yet been determined. Neurod1, regulated by both Neurog1 
and Atoh1, could be the mediator of this cross-regulation.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used Tg(Pax2-Cre) to conditionally delete
Neurod1 in the inner ear. Our data demonstrate for the first time that the
absence of Neurod1 results in formation of hair cells within the inner ear
sensory ganglia. Three cell types, neural crest derived Schwann cells and
mesenchyme derived fibroblasts (neither expresses Neurod1) and inner ear derived 
neurons (which express Neurod1) constitute inner ear ganglia. The most
parsimonious explanation is that Neurod1 suppresses the alternative fate of
sensory neurons to develop as hair cells. In the absence of Neurod1, Atoh1 is
expressed and differentiates cells within the ganglion into hair cells. We
followed up on this effect in ganglia by demonstrating that Neurod1 also
regulates differentiation of subtypes of hair cells in the organ of Corti. We
show that in Neurod1 conditional null mice there is a premature expression of
several genes in the apex of the developing cochlea and outer hair cells are
transformed into inner hair cells.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggest that the long noted cross-regulation
of Atoh1 expression by Neurog1 might actually be mediated in large part by
Neurod1. We suggest that Neurod1 is regulated by both Neurog1 and Atoh1 and
provides a negative feedback for either gene. Through this and other feedback,
Neurod1 suppresses alternate fates of neurons to differentiate as hair cells and 
regulates hair cell subtypes.

c- and N-myc regulate neural precursor cell fate, cell cycle, and metabolism to
direct cerebellar development.

Wey A(1), Martinez Cerdeno V, Pleasure D, Knoepfler PS.

(1)Institute of Pediatric Regenerative Medicine, University of California Davis
School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA 95817, USA.

Separate murine knockout (KO) of either c- or N-myc genes in neural stem and
precursor cells (NSC) driven by nestin-cre causes microcephaly. The cerebellum is
particularly affected in the N-myc KO, leading to a strong reduction in
cerebellar granule neural progenitors (CGNP) and mature granule neurons. In
humans, mutation of N-myc also causes microcephaly in Feingold Syndrome. We
created a double KO (DKO) of c- and N-myc using nestin-cre, which strongly
impairs brain growth, particularly that of the cerebellum. Granule neurons were
almost absent from the Myc DKO cerebellum, and other cell types were relatively
overrepresented, including astroglia, oligodendrocytes, and Purkinje neurons.
These findings are indicative of a profound disruption of cell fate of cerebellar
stem and precursors. DKO Purkinje neurons were strikingly lacking in normal
arborization. Inhibitory neurons were ectopic and exhibited very abnormal GAD67
staining patterns. Also consistent with altered cell fate, the adult DKO
cerebellum still retained a residual external germinal layer (EGL). CGNP in the
DKO EGL were almost uniformly NeuN and p27KIP1 positive as well as negative for
Math1 and BrdU at the peak of normal cerebellar proliferation at P6. The presence
of some mitotic CGNP in the absence of S phase cells suggests a possible arrest
in M phase. CGNP and NSC metabolism also was affected by loss of Myc as DKO cells
exhibited weak nucleolin staining. Together these findings indicate that c- and
N-Myc direct cerebellar development by maintaining CGNP and NSC populations
through inhibiting differentiation as well as directing rapid cell cycling and
active cellular metabolism.

Atonal homolog 1 is required for growth and differentiation effects of
notch/gamma-secretase inhibitors on normal and cancerous intestinal epithelial
cells.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Cincinnati Children's
Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The atonal homolog 1 (Atoh1) transcription factor is required 
for intestinal secretory (goblet, Paneth, enteroendocrine) cell differentiation. 
Notch/gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) block proliferation and induce secretory 
cell differentiation in the intestine. We used genetic analyses of mice to
determine whether Atoh1 mediates the effects of GSIs in normal and cancerous
intestinal epithelia.
METHODS: We studied mice with intestine-specific disruption of Atoh1
(Atoh1(Deltaintestine)), the adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC)(min) mutation,
both mutations (Atoh1(Deltaintestine); APC(min)), or littermate controls; mice
were given GSI or vehicle. Colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines were treated with
GSI or vehicle and with small hairpin RNAs to reduce ATOH1. Differentiation and
homeostasis were assessed by protein, RNA, and histologic analyses.
RESULTS: GSIs failed to induce secretory cell differentiation or apoptosis or
decrease proliferation of Atoh1-null progenitor cells, compared with wild-type
cells. Exposure of APC(min) adenomas to GSIs decreased proliferation and
increased secretory cell numbers in an Atoh1-dependent manner. In CRC cells
treated with GSI, ATOH1 levels were correlated inversely with proliferation.
ATOH1 was required for secretory cell gene expression in cell lines and in mice.
CONCLUSIONS: ATOH1 is required for all effects of GSIs in intestinal crypts and
adenomas; Notch has no unique function in intestinal progenitors and cancer cells
other than to regulate ATOH1 expression. Reducing ATOH1 activity might mitigate
intestinal toxicity from systemic GSI therapy for nonintestinal diseases. Among
gastrointestinal malignancies, ATOH1 mediates the effects of GSIs, so ATOH1
expression levels might predict responses to these inhibitors. We propose that
only the subset of CRCs that retain ATOH1 expression will respond to GSIs.

Generation and characterization of Atoh1-Cre knock-in mouse line.

Author information: 
(1)Flaum Eye Institute, University of Rochester, New York 14642, USA.

Atoh1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor required for
the development of the inner ear sensory epithelia, the dorsal spinal cord,
brainstem, cerebellum, and intestinal secretory cells. In this study, to create a
genetic tool for the research on gene function in the ear sensory organs, we
generated an Atoh1-Cre knock-in mouse line by replacing the entire Atoh1 coding
sequences with the Cre coding sequences. Atoh1(Cre/+) mice were viable, fertile, 
and displayed no visible defects whereas the Atoh1(Cre/Cre) mice died
perinatally. The spatiotemporal activities of Cre recombinase were examined by
crossing Atoh1-Cre mice with the R26R-lacZ conditional reporter mice. Atoh1-Cre
activities were detected in the developing inner ear, the hindbrain, the spinal
cord, and the intestine. In the inner ear, Atoh1-Cre activities were confined to 
the sensory organs in which lacZ expression is detected in nearly all of the hair
cells and in many supporting cells. Thus, Atoh1-Cre mouse line serves as a useful
tool for the functional study of genes in the inner ear. In addition, our results
demonstrate that Atoh1 is expressed in the common progenitors destined for both
hair and supporting cells.

BACKGROUND: SOX2 and Hath1 are transcription factors that are critical for the
control of terminal cell differentiation in the gastrointestinal mucosa. This
study investigated the correlations between SOX2 and Hath1 expression in gastric 
carcinoma and patients' clinicopathological features and prognosis.
METHODS: Hath1 and SOX2 were detected by immunohistochemistry in gastric
carcinoma (n = 50). Probability of survival of patients after surgery was
estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using Log-rank test.
RESULTS: Hath1 and SOX2 were inversely expressed in gastric carcinoma. Patients
with strong SOX2 expression (++ to +++) showed lower incidences of lymph node
metastasis (p = 0.007), deeper invasion (p = 0.010), and III-IV clinical stages
(p = 0.011) compared to patients with low SOX2 expression (- to +). There was no 
significant difference in SOX2 and Hath1 expression in the cancerous tissues of
the patients with and without Helicobacter pylori infection (p > 0.05). The
patients with strong expression of SOX2 in their cancerous tissues (++ to +++)
had a better prognosis than those with low expression of SOX2 (- to +; p =
0.005). There was no correlation between Hath1 expression level and prognosis (p 
= 0.676).
CONCLUSIONS: SOX2 and Hath1 are inversely expressed in gastric carcinoma. SOX2
provides a survival advantage to patients of gastric carcinoma and appears to be 
associated with metastasis and clinical stages.

The cerebellum has critical roles in motor and sensory learning and motor
coordination. Many cerebellum-related disorders indicate cell therapy as a
possible treatment of neural loss. Here we show that application of inductive
signals involved in early patterning of the cerebellar region followed by
application of different factors directs human embryonic stem cell
differentiation into cerebellar-like cells such as granule neurons, Purkinje
cells, interneuron, and glial cells. Neurons derived using our protocol showed a 
T-shaped polarity phenotype and express similar markers to the developed human
cerebellum. Electrophysiological measurements confirmed functional electrical
properties compatible with these cells. In vivo implantation of differentiated
human embryonic stem cells transfected with MATH1-GFP construct into neonatal
mice resulted in cell migration across the molecular and the Purkinje cell layers
and settlement in the internal molecular layers. Our findings demonstrate that
the universal mechanisms involved in the development of cerebellum can be
efficiently recapitulated in vitro, which enables the design of new strategies
for cell replacement therapy, to study early human development and pathogenesis
of neurodegenerative diseases.

Atoh1 inhibits neuronal differentiation and collaborates with Gli1 to generate
medulloblastoma-initiating cells.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Genetics and Tumor Cell Biology, St. Jude Children's Research
Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.

The morphogen and mitogen Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) activates a Gli1-dependent
transcription program that drives proliferation of granule neuron progenitors
(GNP) within the external germinal layer of the postnatally developing
cerebellum. Medulloblastomas with mutations activating the Shh signaling pathway 
preferentially arise within the external germinal layer, and the tumor cells
closely resemble GNPs. Atoh1/Math1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor
essential for GNP histogenesis, does not induce medulloblastomas when expressed
in primary mouse GNPs that are explanted from the early postnatal cerebellum and 
transplanted back into the brains of naïve mice. However, enforced expression of 
Atoh1 in primary GNPs enhances the oncogenicity of cells overexpressing Gli1 by
almost three orders of magnitude. Unlike Gli1, Atoh1 cannot support GNP
proliferation in the absence of Shh signaling and does not govern expression of
canonical cell cycle genes. Instead, Atoh1 maintains GNPs in a Shh-responsive
state by regulating genes that trigger neuronal differentiation, including many
expressed in response to bone morphogenic protein-4. Therefore, by targeting
multiple genes regulating the differentiation state of GNPs, Atoh1 collaborates
with the pro-proliferative Gli1-dependent transcriptional program to influence
medulloblastoma development.

METHODS: The recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1(+)-Hath1 was transfected into HT29
colonic cancer cells, and 3 positive cell clones were randomly selected to test
the levels of Hath1 mRNA, Muc2 mRNA, Hath1, Muc2, cyclin D1 and p27 by
quantitative real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. The proliferation of the
transfected HT29 cells was observed by means of colony formation assay and
xenograft growth in nude mice.
RESULTS: Hath1 significantly down-regulated of cyclin D1 and up-regulate of p27
expressions and inhibited the proliferation of HT29 cells.
CONCLUSION: Hath1 gene may be an anti-oncogene in colon carcinogenesis.

The role of bHLH genes in ear development and evolution: revisiting a 10-year-old
hypothesis.

In mouse ear development, two bHLH genes, Atoh1 and Neurog1, are essential for
hair cell and sensory neuron differentiation. Evolution converted the original
simple atonal-dependent neurosensory cell formation program of diploblasts into
the derived developmental program of vertebrates that generates two neurosensory 
cell types, the sensory neuron and the sensory hair cell. This transformation was
achieved through gene multiplication in ancestral triploblasts resulting in the
expansion of the atonal bHLH gene family. Novel genes of the Neurogenin and
NeuroD families are upregulated prior to the expression of Atoh1. Recent data
suggest that NeuroD and Neurogenin were lost or their function in neuronal
specification reduced in flies, thus changing our perception of the evolution of 
these genes. This sequence of expression changes was accompanied by modification 
of the E-box binding sites of these genes to regulate different downstream genes 
and to form inhibitory loops among each other, thus fine-tuning expression
transitions.

Astroglial cells in the external granular layer are precursors of cerebellar
granule neurons in neonates.

It is well established that cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs) initially
derive from progenitors in the rhombic lip of the embryonic cerebellar
primordium. GCPs proliferate and migrate tangentially across the cerebellum to
form the external granule cell layer (EGL) in late embryogenesis and early
postnatal development. It is unclear whether GCPs are specified exclusively in
the embryonic rhombic lip or whether their precursor persists in the neonate.
Using transgenic mice expressing DsRed under the human glial fibrillary acidic
protein (hGFAP) promoter, we found 2 populations of DsRed(+) cells in the EGL in 
the first postnatal week defined by bright and faint DsRed-fluorescent signal.
Bright DsRed(+) cells have a protein expression profile and electrophysiological 
characteristics typical of astrocytes, but faint DsRed(+) cells in the EGL and
internal granule cell layer (IGL) express markers and physiological properties of
immature neurons. To determine if these astroglial cells gave rise to GCPs, we
genetically tagged them with EGFP or betagal reporter genes at postnatal day
(P)3-P5 using a hGFAP promoter driven inducible Cre recombinase. We found that
GFAP promoter(+) cells in the EGL are proliferative and express glial and neural 
stem cell markers. In addition, immature granule cells (GCs) en route to the IGL 
at P12 as well as GCs in the mature cerebellum, 30days after recombination,
express the reporter protein, suggesting that GFAP promoter(+) cells in the EGL
generate a subset of granule cells. The identification of glial cells which
function as neuronal progenitor cells profoundly impacts our understanding of
cellular plasticity in the developing cerebellum.

The discovery of avian cochlear hair cell regeneration in the late 1980s and the 
concurrent development of new techniques in molecular and developmental biology
generated a renewed interest in understanding the genetic mechanisms that
regulate hair cell development in the embryonic avian and mammalian cochlea and
regeneration in the mature avian cochlea. Research from many labs has
demonstrated that the development of the inner ear utilizes a complex series of
genetic signals and pathways to generate the endorgans, specify cell identities, 
and establish innervation patterns found in the inner ear. Recent studies have
shown that the Notch signaling pathway, the Atoh1/Hes signaling cascade, the stem
cell marker Sox2, and some of the unconventional myosin motor proteins are
utilized to regulate distinct steps in inner ear development. While many of the
individual genes involved in these pathways have been identified from studies of 
mutant and knockout mouse cochleae, the interplay of all these signals into a
single systemic program that directs this process needs to be explored. We need
to know not only what genes are involved, but understand how their gene products 
interact with one another in a structural and temporal framework to guide hair
cell and supporting cell differentiation and maturation.

utricle.

Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.

The mammalian vestibular epithelium has a limited capacity for spontaneous hair
cell regeneration. The mechanism underlying the regeneration is not well
understood. Because the Notch signaling pathway mediates the formation of the
sensory epithelial mosaic patterning during ear development, it may also play a
role in hair cell regeneration in the mature mammalian vestibular epithelium
after a lesion. To investigate the process of spontaneous regeneration in the
vestibular epithelium vis-à-vis changes in Notch signaling, we induced a
unilateral lesion by infusing streptomycin into the mouse posterior semicircular 
canal, and examined Notch signaling molecules and their mRNA expression levels by
immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qRTPCR), respectively. We detected Jagged1 in supporting cells in both normal
and lesioned utricles. Atoh1, a marker for early developing hair cells, was
absent in the intact mature tissue, but re-appeared after the lesion. Many cells 
were either positive for both Atoh1 and myosin VIIa, or for one of them. qRTPCR
data showed a post trauma decrease of Hes5 and an increase in Atoh1. Atoh1
up-regulation may either be a result of Hes5 down-regulation or mediated by
another signaling pathway.

In vivo proliferation of postmitotic cochlear supporting cells by acute ablation 
of the retinoblastoma protein in neonatal mice.

Cochlear hair cells (HCs) are mechanosensory receptors that transduce sound into 
electrical signals. HC damage in nonmammalian vertebrates induces surrounding
supporting cells (SCs) to divide, transdifferentiate and replace lost HCs;
however, such spontaneous HC regeneration does not occur in the mammalian
cochlea. Here, we acutely ablate the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), a crucial cell 
cycle regulator, in two subtypes of postmitotic SCs (pillar and Deiters' cells)
using an inducible Cre line, Prox1-CreER(T2). Inactivation of Rb in these SCs
results in cell cycle reentry of both pillar and Deiters' cells, and completion
of cell division with an increase in cell number of pillar cells. Interestingly, 
nuclei of Rb(-/-) mitotic pillar and Deiters' cells migrate toward the HC layer
and divide near the epithelial surface in a manner similar to the SCs in the
regenerating avian auditory epithelium. In contrast to postmitotic Rb(-/-) HCs
which abort cell division, postmitotic Rb(-/-) pillar cells can proliferate,
maintain their SC fate and survive for more than a week. However, no newly formed
HCs are detected and SC death followed by HC loss occurs. Our studies accomplish 
a crucial step toward functional HC regeneration in the mammalian cochlea in
vivo, demonstrating the critical role of Rb in maintaining quiescence of
postmitotic pillar and Deiters' cells and highlighting the heterogeneity between 
these two cell types. Therefore, the combination of transient Rb inactivation and
further manipulation of transcription factors (i.e., Atoh1 activation) in SCs may
represent an effective therapeutic avenue for HC regeneration in the mammalian
cochlea.

The regularity of sustained firing reveals two populations of slowly adapting
touch receptors in mouse hairy skin.

Wellnitz SA(1), Lesniak DR, Gerling GJ, Lumpkin EA.

Author information:

Touch is initiated by diverse somatosensory afferents that innervate the skin.
The ability to manipulate and classify receptor subtypes is prerequisite for
elucidating sensory mechanisms. Merkel cell-neurite complexes, which distinguish 
shapes and textures, are experimentally tractable mammalian touch receptors that 
mediate slowly adapting type I (SAI) responses. The assessment of SAI function in
mutant mice has been hindered because previous studies did not distinguish SAI
responses from slowly adapting type II (SAII) responses, which are thought to
arise from different end organs, such as Ruffini endings. Thus we sought methods 
to discriminate these afferent types. We developed an epidermis-up ex vivo
skin-nerve chamber to record action potentials from afferents while imaging
Merkel cells in intact receptive fields. Using model-based cluster analysis, we
found that two types of slowly adapting receptors were readily distinguished
based on the regularity of touch-evoked firing patterns. We identified these
clusters as SAI (coefficient of variation = 0.78 +/- 0.09) and SAII responses
(0.21 +/- 0.09). The identity of SAI afferents was confirmed by recording from
transgenic mice with green fluorescent protein-expressing Merkel cells. SAI
receptive fields always contained fluorescent Merkel cells (n = 10), whereas SAII
receptive fields lacked these cells (n = 5). Consistent with reports from other
vertebrates, mouse SAI and SAII responses arise from afferents exhibiting similar
conduction velocities, receptive field sizes, mechanical thresholds, and firing
rates. These results demonstrate that mice, like other vertebrates, have two
classes of slowly adapting light-touch receptors, identify a simple method to
distinguish these populations, and extend the utility of skin-nerve recordings
for genetic dissection of touch receptor mechanisms.

The intestinal epithelium is a complex system characterized by massive and
continuous cell renewal and differentiation. In this context, cell-type-specific 
transcription factors are thought to play a crucial role by modulating specific
transcription networks and signalling pathways. Hnf1alpha and beta are closely
related atypical homeoprotein transcription factors expressed in several
epithelia, including the gut. With the use of a conditional inactivation system, 
we generated mice in which Hnf1b is specifically inactivated in the intestinal
epithelium on a wild-type or Hnf1a(-/-) genetic background. Whereas the
inactivation of Hnf1a or Hnf1b alone did not lead to any major intestinal
dysfunction, the concomitant inactivation of both genes resulted in a lethal
phenotype. Double-mutant animals had defective differentiation and cell fate
commitment. The expression levels of markers of all the differentiated cell
types, both enterocytes and secretory cells, were affected. In addition, the
number of goblet cells was increased, whereas mature Paneth cells were missing.
At the molecular level, we show that Hnf1alpha and beta act upstream of the Notch
pathway controlling directly the expression of two crucial components: Jag1 and
Atoh1. We demonstrate that the double-mutant mice present with a defect in
intestinal water absorption and that Hnf1alpha and beta directly control the
expression of Slc26a3, a gene whose mutations are associated with chloride
diarrhoea in human patients. Our study identifies new direct target genes of the 
Hnf1 transcription factors and shows that they play crucial roles in both
defining cell fate and controlling terminal functions in the gut epithelium.

In mammals, cerebellar neurons are categorized as glutamatergic or GABAergic, and
are derived from progenitors that express the proneural genes atoh1 or ptf1a,
respectively. In zebrafish, three atoh1 genes, atoh1a, atoh1b, and atoh1c, are
expressed in overlapping but distinct expression domains in the upper rhombic lip
(URL): ptf1a is expressed exclusively in the ventricular zone (VZ). Using
transgenic lines expressing fluorescent proteins under the control of the
regulatory elements of atoh1a and ptf1a, we traced the lineages of the cerebellar
neurons. The atoh1(+) progenitors gave rise not only to granule cells but also to
neurons of the anteroventral rhombencephalon. The ptf1a(+) progenitors generated 
Purkinje cells. The olig2(+) eurydendroid cells, which are glutamatergic, were
derived mostly from ptf1a(+) progenitors in the VZ but some originated from the
atoh1(+) progenitors in the URL. In the adult cerebellum, atoh1a, atoh1b, and
atoh1c are expressed in the molecular layer of the valvula cerebelli and of the
medial corpus cerebelli, and ptf1a was detected in the VZ. The proneural gene
expression patterns coincided with the sites of proliferating neuronal
progenitors in the adult cerebellum. Our data indicate that proneural gene-linked
neurogenesis is evolutionarily conserved in the cerebellum among vertebrates, and
that the continuously generated neurons help remodel neural circuits in the adult
zebrafish cerebellum.

Embryonic neural stem cells (NSCs) were isolated from the neuroepithelium of the 
dorsal telencephalon of embryonic rats and infected by Ad5-Atoh1-enhanced green
fluorescent protein. These NSCs were then delivered into neurosphere culture
medium or transplanted into the endolymphatic space of the normal guinea pig
cochlea through cochleostomy. Embryonic NSC phenotype of these isolated cells was
determined by immunohistochemical detection of cell-specific protein markers.
Survival, location and hair cell (HC) differentiation of the implanted NSCs were 
determined by the expression of the report gene, enhanced green fluorescent
protein, and a specific marker for HCs, Myosin VIIa. These implanted cells can
survive in the endolymphatic space of the cochlea. Some of the surviving cells
differentiated into HCs by Atoh1 gene transfer.

Rhombomere 1 (r1), a temporary structure in the early developing brain, is
bounded rostrally by the isthmus organizer and caudally by the r2 domain. Many
genes involved in r1 induction and patterning have been identified. However, our 
knowledge of a comprehensive map of r1 regionalization defined by these genes at 
early embryonic stages remains fragmentary. In the present study, we examined the
expression of a variety of genes in the dorsal r1 of E9.0-E10.5 mouse embryos.
The expression domains within ventricular zone of these genes examined allowed us
to define four distinct regions along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis of the
dorsal r1: the Wnt1/Lmx1a/Gdf7/Msx1/Msx2-positive roof plate,
Math1/Olig3/Msx1/Msx2-positive, upper rhombic lip, Mash1/Ngn1/Ngn2-positive
intermediate domain, and Mash1/Ngn1/Ngn2-positive rostral domain. Moreover, we
defined the distribution of several genes expressed in the mantle zone of the
dorsal r1, including Lmx1b, Lhx2, Lhx9, Phox2a and Phox2b. Taken together, our
gene expression data identify a refined subdivision of the dorsal r1 with four
distinct domains along the A-P axis and a mantle zone at early embryonic stages.

Absence of an external germinal layer in zebrafish and shark reveals a distinct, 
anamniote ground plan of cerebellum development.

Chaplin N(1), Tendeng C, Wingate RJ.

The granule cell layer of the cerebellum comprises the largest population of
neurons in the vertebrate CNS. In amniotes, its precursors undergo a unique phase
of transit amplification, regulated by Sonic hedgehog. They do so within a
prominent but transient secondary proliferative epithelium, the external germinal
layer, which is formed by tangential migration of precursor cells from the
rhombic lip. This behavior is a hallmark of bird and mammal cerebellum
development. Despite its significance for both development and disease, it is
unclear whether an external germinal layer is a requirement for granule cell
production or an expedient of transit amplification. Evidence for its existence
in more basal vertebrates is contradictory. We therefore examined cerebellum
development in the zebrafish, specifically in relation to the expression of the
basic helix-loop-helix gene Atonal 1, which definitively characterizes granule
cell precursors. The expression of Atoh1a-Atoh1c, in combination with patterns of
proliferation and fate maps, define precursor pools at the rhombic lip and
cerebellar midline but demonstrate that an external germinal layer is absent.
Sonic hedgehog signaling is correspondingly absent in the zebrafish cerebellum.
Sustained roof-plate-derived signals suggest that, in the absence of transit
amplification, primary granule cell precursor pools are maintained throughout
development. To determine whether this pattern is specific to zebrafish or
reflects a more general anamniote organization, we examined the expression of
similar genes in the dogfish, Scylliorhinus canicula. We show that these
anamniotes share a common ground plan of granule cell production that does not
include an external germinal layer.

Notch signaling has previously been implicated in the regulation of the cell fate
of intestinal epithelial cells. However, the expression and function of Notch
ligands in the human intestine remain largely unknown. In the present study, we
showed that Notch ligands Delta-like 1 (Dll1) and Delta-like 4 (Dll4) are
expressed in a goblet cell-specific manner in human colonic tissue. Additionally,
we found that Dll1 and Dll4 expression was regulated in-parallel with Atoh1 and
MUC2, which are both under the control of the Notch-Hes1 signaling pathway.
Because knockdown of Dll1 expression completely abrogated the acquisition of the 
goblet cell phenotype in Notch-inactivated colonic epithelial cells, we postulate
that Dll1 might function as a cis-acting regulatory element that induces
undifferentiated cells to become goblet cells. Our results suggest a link between
Dll1 expression and human goblet cell differentiation that might be mediated by a
function that is distinct from its role as a Notch receptor ligand.

BACKGROUND: Goblet cells, which contribute to mucosal defense and repair in the
intestinal epithelium, are depleted in human and rodent colitis. The Notch signal
pathway regulates the differentiation of intestinal stem cells into epithelial
cells and inhibits the differentiation of secretory lineages, including goblet
cells. The aim of our study was to clarify whether the blocking of the Notch
pathway at an early stage of colitis would preserve goblet cells and facilitate
the healing process in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice.
METHODS: DSS was orally administered to C57/BL6 mice for 7 days, and
dibenzazepine (DBZ), a Notch pathway blocker, was administered for 5 consecutive 
days, beginning on the first day of DSS treatment. Colonic mucosal inflammation
was evaluated clinically, biochemically, and histologically. The expression of
the goblet cell-associated genes Math1 and MUC2 and proinflammatory cytokines was
evaluated by real-time reverse-transcriptase-PCR, with the expression of Math1
and MUC2 also visualized by immunohistochemical examination.
RESULTS: The administration of DBZ at 4 mumol/kg significantly reduced the
severity of the colitis. Compared with the DSS only-treated intestine, the number
of goblet cells was relatively sustained, and the expression of Math1 and MUC2
was also elevated in the DSS/DBZ-treated intestine. DBZ treatment suppressed the 
mRNA levels for interleukin-1beta and -6, and matrix metalloproteinases-3 and -9 
in the DSS-treated intestine.
CONCLUSIONS: Early-stage blocking of Notch signaling may ameliorate acute DSS
colitis by preventing reduction in the number of goblet cells.

NOTCH signaling is required for formation and self-renewal of tumor-initiating
cells and for repression of secretory cell differentiation in colon cancer.

California, Irvine, California, USA.

NOTCH signaling is critical for specifying the intestinal epithelial cell lineage
and for initiating colorectal adenomas and colorectal cancers (CRC). Based on
evidence that NOTCH is important for the maintenance and self-renewal of
cancer-initiating cells in other malignancies, we studied the role of NOTCH
signaling in colon cancer-initiating cells (CCIC). Tumors formed by CCICs
maintain many properties of the primary CRCs from which they were derived, such
as glandular organization, cell polarity, gap junctions, and expression of
characteristic CRC molecular markers. Furthermore, CCICs have the property of
self-renewal. In this study, we show that NOTCH signaling is 10- to 30-fold
higher in CCIC compared with widely used colon cancer cell lines. Using
small-molecule inhibition and short hairpin RNA knockdown, we show that NOTCH
prevents CCIC apoptosis through repression of cell cycle kinase inhibitor p27 and
transcription factor ATOH1. NOTCH is also critical to intrinsic maintenance of
CCIC self-renewal and the repression of secretory cell lineage differentiation
genes such as MUC2. Our findings describe a novel human cell system to study
NOTCH signaling in CRC tumor initiation and suggest that inhibition of NOTCH
signaling may improve CRC chemoprevention and chemotherapy.

CONCLUSION: Replacement of vestibular hair cells induced by atoh1 driven by the
tissue-specific GFAP promoter was significantly more efficient than use of the
cBA or hCMV promoter.
OBJECTIVE: To test whether expression level, persistence, or selectivity from
adenovirus vectors delivered in the inner ear can be altered by changing the
adenovector backbone or by using different cellular and viral promoters.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adenovector and promoter modifications were tested for
differences in transgene expression in adult macular organs. The effect of using 
an E1/E3 deleted vector was compared to E1/E3/E4 deleted vectors. The effect of
using viral and cellular promoters to modify transgene expression was tested in
explanted adult mouse macular organs. Based on these results three different
promoters were tested for efficacy of atonal gene.
RESULTS: Use of adenovectors containing human CMV, the hybrid cBA and ubiquitin
promoters driving transgene expression resulted in different types of transgene
expression. While several viral and cellular promoters provided broad cell type
expression, expression driven by the GFAP promoter was limited to vestibular
supporting cells, demonstrating the specificity of this promoter.

Excitatory neurons of the proprioceptive, interoceptive, and arousal hindbrain
networks share a developmental requirement for Math1.

Hindbrain networks important for sensation and arousal contain diverse neuronal
populations with distinct projections, yet share specific characteristics such as
neurotransmitter expression. The relationship between the function of these
neurons, their developmental origin, and the timing of their migration remains
unclear. Mice lacking the proneural transcription factor Math1 (Atoh1) lose
neurons essential for hearing, balance, and unconscious proprioception. By using 
a new, inducible Math1(Cre*PR) allele, we found that Math1 is also required for
the conscious proprioceptive system, including excitatory projection neurons of
the dorsal column nuclei and for vital components of the interoceptive system,
such as Barrington's nucleus, that is closely associated with arousal. In
addition to specific networks, Math1 lineages shared specific neurotransmitter
expression, including glutamate, acetylcholine, somatostatin, corticotropin
releasing hormone, and nitric oxide. These findings identify twenty novel Math1
lineages and indicate that the Math1 network functions partly as an interface for
conscious (early-born) and unconscious (late-born) proprioceptive inputs to the
cortex and cerebellum, respectively. In addition, these data provide previously
unsuspected genetic and developmental links between proprioception,
interoception, hearing, and arousal.

Granule neuron precursors (GNPs) are the most actively proliferating cells in the
postnatal nervous system, and mutations in pathways that control the GNP cell
cycle can result in medulloblastoma. The transcription factor Atoh1 has been
suspected to contribute to GNP proliferation, but its role in normal and
neoplastic postnatal cerebellar development remains unexplored. We show that
Atoh1 regulates the signal transduction pathway of Sonic Hedgehog, an
extracellular factor that is essential for GNP proliferation, and demonstrate
that deletion of Atoh1 prevents cerebellar neoplasia in a mouse model of
medulloblastoma. Our data shed light on the function of Atoh1 in postnatal
cerebellar development and identify a new mechanism that can be targeted to
regulate medulloblastoma formation.

The retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is a group of neurons in the rostral medulla,
defined here as Phox2b-, Vglut2-, neurokinin1 receptor-, and Atoh1-expressing
cells in the parafacial region, which have been proposed to function both as
generators of respiratory rhythm and as central respiratory chemoreceptors. The
present study was undertaken to assess these two putative functions using genetic
tools. We generated two conditional Phox2b mutations, which target different
subsets of Phox2b-expressing cells, but have in common a massive depletion of RTN
neurons. In both conditional mutants as well as in the previously described
Phox2b(27Ala) mutants, in which the RTN is also compromised, the respiratory-like
rhythmic activity normally seen in the parafacial region of fetal brainstem
preparations was completely abrogated. Rhythmic motor bursts were recorded from
the phrenic nerve roots in the mutants, but their frequency was markedly reduced.
Both the rhythmic activity in the RTN region and the phrenic nerve discharges
responded to a low pH challenge in control, but not in the mutant embryos.
Together, our results provide genetic evidence for the essential role of the
Phox2b-expressing RTN neurons both in establishing a normal respiratory rhythm
before birth and in providing chemosensory drive.

Expression of Reg IV and Hath1 in neuroendocrine neoplasms.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Haartman Institute, University of Helsinki, Helsinki,
Finland.

Reg IV (RELP), a Regenerating protein family member, is constitutively expressed 
in neuroendocrine cells of the intestinal mucosa. The helix-loop-helix
transcription factor Hath1 is the human homologue of murine Math1, which
regulates the embryonic differentiation of neural and intestinal secretory
lineage cells. Hath1 is constitutively expressed in a subset of mature secretory 
gastrointestinal cells. We investigated by immunohistochemistry the expression of
Reg IV and Hath1 in 63 neuroendocrine tumors. Intestinal neuroendocrine neoplasms
showed co-expression of Reg IV and Hath1, as did parathyroidal and Merkel cell
tumors. Lung small-cell carcinoma and gastric mucocellular carcinoma expressed
only Reg IV. Pancreatic islet-derived tumors, pheochromocytomas, and
paragangliomas expressed only Hath1. Lymph node and liver metastases retained the
tissue-specific expression patterns. These distinct expression profiles may be
useful for differential diagnostics of metastatic lesions of neuroendocrine
tumors. The dissimilar expression patterns suggest that the proteins belong to
different signaling pathways and are activated at different stages of
neuroendocrine differentiation. Local Reg IV expression may be influenced by the 
growth factors bFGF and HGF and/or their receptors CD138 and c-met, which were
found to co-localize with Reg IV in intestinal neuroendocrine tumors.

Mice lacking the proneural transcription factor Math1 (Atoh1) lack multiple
neurons of the proprioceptive and arousal systems and die shortly after birth
from an apparent inability to initiate respiration. We sought to determine
whether Math1 was necessary for the development of hindbrain nuclei involved in
respiratory rhythm generation, such as the parafacial respiratory
group/retrotrapezoid nucleus (pFRG/RTN), defects in which are associated with
congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). We generated a Math1-GFP
fusion allele to trace the development of Math1-expressing pFRG/RTN and
paratrigeminal neurons and found that loss of Math1 did indeed disrupt their
migration and differentiation. We also identified Math1-dependent neurons and
their projections near the pre-Bötzinger complex, a structure critical for
respiratory rhythmogenesis, and found that glutamatergic modulation reestablished
a rhythm in the absence of Math1. This study identifies Math1-dependent neurons
that are critical for perinatal breathing that may link proprioception and
arousal with respiration.

Sonic hedgehog (SHH) promotes the differentiation of mouse cochlear neural
progenitors via the Math1-Brn3.1 signaling pathway in vitro.

Sonic hedgehog (SHH) is essential for the development of the cochlear duct that
harbors the organ of Corti. However, little is known about the molecular
signaling pathway through which SHH promotes the development of the organ of
Corti, especially cochlear sensory epithelial cells. In this study, we
demonstrated that SHH contributes to the differentiation of cochlear neural
progenitors (CNPs), which are derived from the postnatal day 1 organ of Corti in 
mice. Addition of SHH to CNPs increased the formation of epithelial cell islands,
simultaneously activated the expression of Math1 that is a transcription factor
for the initial differentiation of auditory hair cells. The increased expression 
of Math1 then regulated the promoter activity of Brn3.1, another transcription
factor that controls the further differentiation and survival of auditory hair
cells. Taken together, our data suggest that SHH plays an important role in the
promotion of auditory hair cell differentiation via the Math1-Brn3.1 signaling
pathway.

Beta-catenin up-regulates Atoh1 expression in neural progenitor cells by
interaction with an Atoh1 3' enhancer.

(1)Department of Otology and Laryngology, Harvard Medical School, Boston,
Massachusetts 02115, USA.

Atoh1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, plays a critical role in
the differentiation of several epithelial and neural cell types. We found that
beta-catenin, the key mediator of the canonical Wnt pathway, increased expression
of Atoh1 in mouse neuroblastoma cells and neural progenitor cells, and baseline
Atoh1 expression was decreased by siRNA directed at beta-catenin. The
up-regulation of Atoh1 was caused by an interaction of beta-catenin with the
Atoh1 enhancer that could be demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. We
found that two putative Tcf-Lef sites in the 3' enhancer of the Atoh1 gene
displayed an affinity for beta-catenin and were critical for the activation of
Atoh1 transcription because mutation of either site decreased expression of a
reporter gene downstream of the enhancer. Tcf-Lef co-activators were found in the
complex that bound to these sites in the DNA together with beta-catenin.
Inhibition of Notch signaling, which has previously been shown to induce bHLH
transcription factor expression, increased beta-catenin expression in progenitor 
cells of the nervous system. Because this could be a mechanism for up-regulation 
of Atoh1 after inhibition of Notch, we tested whether siRNA to beta-catenin
prevented the increase in Atoh1 and found that beta-catenin expression was
required for increased expression of Atoh1 after Notch inhibition.

Pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus: bile acids inhibit the Notch signaling
pathway with induction of CDX2 gene expression in human esophageal cells.

Litle V, Peters JH.

Author information:

14642, USA.

BACKGROUND: Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the predominant risk factor for the
development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. BE is characterized by intestinal
metaplasia with goblet cells. Reflux of bile acids is known to induce intestinal 
metaplasia, but the mechanisms are unclear. Inhibition of Notch signaling
accompanied by increased Hath1 and induction of caudal homeobox 2 (CDX2) may be
involved in development of intestinal goblet cells.
METHODS: Esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines OE19 and OE33 were exposed for up
to 8 hours to DCA (100-300 microM), and for up to 24 hours with and without the
gamma-secretase inhibitor, DAPT (20 microM). Notch signaling components and CDX2 
levels were measured by real-time PCR (for mRNA) and by Western blot analysis
(for proteins).
RESULTS: DCA induced a time and concentration dependent decrease in Notch pathway
components mRNAs in OE33 and in the proteins in both cell lines. CDX2 mRNA and
Hath1 protein were increased in OE19 by 3-fold. Inhibition of Notch pathway by
DAPT decreased downstream Notch signaling mRNAs and proteins in both cell lines
and increased Hath1 and CDX2 proteins only in OE19.
CONCLUSION: Bile acid inhibition of Notch signaling in esophageal cells is
correlated with an increase in Hath1 and CDX2 and may be one of the key processes
contributing to the formation of BE.

Merkel cells (MCs) are located in the touch-sensitive area of the epidermis and
mediate mechanotransduction in the skin. Whether MCs originate from embryonic
epidermal or neural crest progenitors has been a matter of intense controversy
since their discovery >130 yr ago. In addition, how MCs are maintained during
adulthood is currently unknown. In this study, using lineage-tracing experiments,
we show that MCs arise through the differentiation of epidermal progenitors
during embryonic development. In adults, MCs undergo slow turnover and are
replaced by cells originating from epidermal stem cells, not through the
proliferation of differentiated MCs. Conditional deletion of the Atoh1/Math1
transcription factor in epidermal progenitors results in the absence of MCs in
all body locations, including the whisker region. Our study demonstrates that MCs
arise from the epidermis by an Atoh1-dependent mechanism and opens new avenues
for study of MC functions in sensory perception, neuroendocrine signaling, and MC
carcinoma.

SAM pointed domain ETS factor (SPDEF) regulates terminal differentiation and
maturation of intestinal goblet cells.

Noah TK(1), Kazanjian A, Whitsett J, Shroyer NF.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Gastroenterology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center
and University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: SPDEF (also termed PDEF or PSE) is an ETS family
transcription factor that regulates gene expression in the prostate and goblet
cell hyperplasia in the lung. Spdef has been reported to be expressed in the
intestine. In this paper, we identify an important role for Spdef in regulating
intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis and differentiation.
METHODS: SPDEF expression was inhibited in colon cancer cells to determine its
ability to control goblet cell gene activation. The effects of transgenic
expression of Spdef on intestinal differentiation and homeostasis were
determined.
RESULTS: In LS174T colon cancer cells treated with Notch/gamma-secretase
inhibitor to activate goblet cell gene expression, shRNAs that inhibited SPDEF
also repressed expression of goblet cell genes AGR2, MUC2, RETLNB, and SPINK4.
Transgenic expression of Spdef caused the expansion of intestinal goblet cells
and corresponding reduction in Paneth, enteroendocrine, and absorptive
enterocytes. Spdef inhibited proliferation of intestinal crypt cells without
induction of apoptosis. Prolonged expression of the Spdef transgene caused a
progressive reduction in the number of crypts that expressed Spdef, consistent
with its inhibitory effects on cell proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: Spdef was sufficient to inhibit proliferation of intestinal
progenitors and induce differentiation into goblet cells; SPDEF was required for 
activation of goblet cell associated genes in vitro. These data support a model
in which Spdef promotes terminal differentiation into goblet cells of a common
goblet/Paneth progenitor.

Mammalian Merkel cells are descended from the epidermal lineage.

44106, USA.

Merkel cells are specialized cells in the skin that are important for proper
neural encoding of light touch stimuli. Conflicting evidence suggests that these 
cells are lineally descended from either the skin or the neural crest. To address
this question, we used epidermal (Krt14(Cre)) and neural crest (Wnt1(Cre))
Cre-driver lines to conditionally delete Atoh1 specifically from the skin or
neural crest lineages, respectively, of mice. Deletion of Atoh1 from the skin
lineage resulted in loss of Merkel cells from all regions of the skin, while
deletion from the neural crest lineage had no effect on this cell population.
Thus, mammalian Merkel cells are derived from the skin lineage.

Mammalian auditory sensation is mediated by the organ of Corti, a specialized
sensory epithelium found in the cochlea of the inner ear. Proper auditory
function requires that the many different cell types found in the sensory
epithelium be precisely ordered within an exquisitely patterned cellular mosaic. 
The development of this mosaic depends on a series of cell fate decisions that
transform the initially nearly uniform cochlear epithelium into the complex
structure of the mature organ of Corti. The prosensory domain, which contains the
progenitors of both the mechanosensory hair cells and their associated supporting
cells, first becomes distinct from both the neural and the nonsensory domains.
Further cell fate decisions subdivide prosensory cells into populations of inner 
and outer hair cells, and several different types of supporting cells. A number
of different signaling pathways and transcription factors are known to be
necessary for these developmental processes; in this review, we will summarize
these results with an emphasis on recent findings.

Atoh1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor necessary for the
specification of inner ear hair cells and central auditory system neurons derived
from the rhombic lip. We used the Cre-loxP system and two Cre-driver lines
(Egr2(Cre) and Hoxb1(Cre)) to delete Atoh1 from different regions of the cochlear
nucleus (CN) and accessory auditory nuclei (AAN). Adult Atoh1-conditional
knock-out mice (Atoh1(CKO)) are behaviorally deaf, have diminished auditory
brainstem evoked responses, and have disrupted CN and AAN morphology and
connectivity. In addition, Egr2; Atoh1(CKO) mice lose spiral ganglion neurons in 
the cochlea and AAN neurons during the first 3 d of life, revealing a novel
critical period in the development of these neurons. These new mouse models of
predominantly central deafness illuminate the importance of the CN for support of
a subset of peripheral and central auditory neurons.

Tools for suppressing synaptic transmission gain power when able to target highly
selective neuron subtypes, thereby sharpening attainable links between neuron
type, behavior, and disease; and when able to silence most any neuron subtype,
thereby offering broad applicability. Here, we present such a tool, RC::PFtox,
that harnesses breadth in scope along with high cell-type selection via
combinatorial gene expression to deliver tetanus toxin light chain (tox), an
inhibitor of vesicular neurotransmission. When applied in mice, we observed
cell-type-specific disruption of vesicle exocytosis accompanied by loss of
excitatory postsynaptic currents and commensurately perturbed behaviors. Among
various test populations, we applied RC::PFtox to silence serotonergic neurons,
en masse or a subset defined combinatorially. Of the behavioral phenotypes
observed upon en masse serotonergic silencing, only one mapped to the
combinatorially defined subset. These findings provide evidence for separability 
by genetic lineage of serotonin-modulated behaviors; collectively, these findings
demonstrate broad utility of RC::PFtox for dissecting neuron functions.

FOXC1 is required for normal cerebellar development and is a major contributor to
chromosome 6p25.3 Dandy-Walker malformation.

Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM), the most common human cerebellar malformation,
has only one characterized associated locus. Here we characterize a second
DWM-linked locus on 6p25.3, showing that deletions or duplications encompassing
FOXC1 are associated with cerebellar and posterior fossa malformations including 
cerebellar vermis hypoplasia (CVH), mega-cisterna magna (MCM) and DWM. Foxc1-null
mice have embryonic abnormalities of the rhombic lip due to loss of
mesenchyme-secreted signaling molecules with subsequent loss of Atoh1 expression 
in vermis. Foxc1 homozygous hypomorphs have CVH with medial fusion and foliation 
defects. Human FOXC1 heterozygous mutations are known to affect eye development, 
causing a spectrum of glaucoma-associated anomalies (Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome,
ARS; MIM no. 601631). We report the first brain imaging data from humans with
FOXC1 mutations and show that these individuals also have CVH. We conclude that
alteration of FOXC1 function alone causes CVH and contributes to MCM and DWM. Our
results highlight a previously unrecognized role for mesenchyme-neuroepithelium
interactions in the mid-hindbrain during early embryogenesis.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A significant proportion of hearing loss and deafness is
caused by defects in the structure or function of cells within the organ of
Corti. Identification of the molecular factors that regulate the development of
this structure should provide valuable insights regarding inner ear formation and
the signaling pathways that underlie congenital auditory deficits. In addition,
targeted modulation of these same factors could be developed as therapies for
hair cell regeneration.
RECENT FINDINGS: Results from experiments using transgenic and mutant mice, as
well as in-vitro techniques, have identified genes and signaling pathways that
are required to either specify unique auditory cell types, such as hair cells or 
supporting cells, or to generate the highly ordered cellular pattern that is
characteristic for the organ of Corti. In particular, the hedgehog and fibroblast
growth factor signaling pathways modulate the formation of the progenitor cells
that will give rise to the organ of Corti. SRY-box containing gene 2, a
transcription factor that is required for the formation of the cochlear
progenitor cell population, has paradoxically been shown to also act as an
inhibitor of hair cell development. Finally, the motor protein myosin II
regulates extension of the organ of Corti and the alignment of hair cells and
supporting cells into ordered rows.
SUMMARY: A better understanding of the signaling pathways that direct different
aspects of cochlear development, such as specific of cell fates or cellular
patterning, offers the potential to identify new pathways or molecules that could
be targeted for therapeutic interventions.

The wnt target jagged-1 mediates the activation of notch signaling by progastrin 
in human colorectal cancer cells.

Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U661, University of Montpellier I, Montpellier,

The Wnt and Notch signaling pathways are both abnormally activated in colorectal 
cancer (CRC). We recently showed that progastrin depletion inhibited Wnt
signaling and increased goblet cell differentiation of CRC cells. Here, we show
that progastrin down-regulation restores the expression by CRC cells of the early
secretory lineage marker Math-1/Hath-1 due to an inhibition of Notch signaling.
This effect is mediated by a decreased transcription of the Notch ligand
Jagged-1, downstream of beta-catenin/Tcf-4. Accordingly, recombinant progastrin
sequentially activated the transcription of Wnt and Notch target genes in
progastrin-depleted cells. In addition, restoration of Jagged-1 levels in these
cells is sufficient to activate Tcf-4 activity, demonstrating the occurrence of a
feedback regulation from Notch toward Wnt signaling. These results suggest that
progastrin could be instrumental in maintaining the concomitant activation of Wnt
and Notch pathways in CRC cells, further highlighting the interest of progastrin 
targeting for the clinical management of CRC.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review will focus on 'self-repair' of the mammalian inner
ear sensory epithelium, including recruiting the in-situ proliferation and
differentiation of endogenous cells at the damaged site and the autologous
transplantation
RECENT FINDINGS: Self-repair refers to a favorable structural and functional
outcome of damaged inner ear sensory epithelium. Our advanced ability of
manipulating the fate of inner ear sensory cells makes in-situ proliferation a
possible candidate of hearing restoration. A practical alternative of the
unavoidable immune rejection is to introduce autologous cells. Ependymal cells,
induced pluripotent stem cells, and olfactory neuroepithelial cells have been
recognized as promising sources, which will spur ongoing efforts to evaluate
these new cell sources for cell replacement therapy.
SUMMARY: Further exploration of the innate advantages of in-situ proliferation
and use of novel cell sources for autologous transplantation may serve as
rehearsals for clinical trials in the near future.

Defects in the cerebella of conditional Neurod1 null mice correlate with
effective Tg(Atoh1-cre) recombination and granule cell requirements for Neurod1
for differentiation.

Neurod1 is a crucial basic helix-loop-helix gene for most cerebellar granule
cells and mediates the differentiation of these cells downstream of
Atoh1-mediated proliferation of the precursors. In Neurod1 null mice, granule
cells die throughout the posterior two thirds of the cerebellar cortex during
development. However, Neurod1 is also necessary for pancreatic beta-cell
development, and therefore Neurod1 null mice are diabetic, which potentially
influences cerebellar defects. Here, we report a new Neurod1 conditional
knock-out mouse model created by using a Tg(Atoh1-cre) line to eliminate Neurod1 
in the cerebellar granule cell precursors. Our data confirm and extend previous
work on systemic Neurod1 null mice and show that, in the central lobules, granule
cells can be eradicated in the absence of Neurod1. Granule cells in the anterior 
lobules are partially viable and depend on as yet unknown genes, but the Purkinje
cells show defects not previously recognized. Interestingly, delayed and
incomplete Tg(Atoh1-cre) upregulation occurs in the most posterior lobules; this 
leads to near normal expression of Neurod1 with a concomitant normal
differentiation of granule cells, Purkinje cells, and unipolar brush cells in
lobules IX and X. Our analysis suggests that Neurod1 negatively regulates Atoh1
to ensure a rapid transition from proliferative precursors to differentiating
neurons. Our data have implications for research on medulloblastoma, one of the
most frequent brain tumors of children, as the results suggest that targeted
overexpression of Neurod1 under Atoh1 promoter control may initiate the
differentiation of these tumors.

Hair cell loss in higher vertebrates appears to be permanent. Progenitors that
are quiescent in the organ of Corti are the best candidates for the restoration
of the different cell types in the organ of Corti. However, little is known about
the presence of these progenitors and their capacity to differentiate into hair
cells. This review will first highlight recent findings concerning the
identification of progenitor cells that are able to proliferate and to
differentiate into hair cells. Principal factors impinging on this process are
then reviewed. Auditory hair cell progenitors have been identified and, under
appropriate conditions, are capable of proliferating and differentiating into
hair cells. Characterization of signals that maintain, expand and regulate these 
progenitors will be essential for the biomedical application of stem cell
populations to restore hearing.

The peripheral nervous system detects different somatosensory stimuli, including 
pain, temperature, and touch. Merkel cell-neurite complexes are touch receptors
composed of sensory afferents and Merkel cells. The role that Merkel cells play
in light-touch responses has been the center of controversy for over 100 years.
We used Cre-loxP technology to conditionally delete the transcription factor
Atoh1 from the body skin and foot pads of mice. Merkel cells are absent from
these areas in Atoh1(CKO) animals. Ex vivo skin/nerve preparations from
Atoh1(CKO) animals demonstrate complete loss of the characteristic
neurophysiologic responses normally mediated by Merkel cell-neurite complexes.
Merkel cells are, therefore, required for the proper encoding of Merkel receptor 
responses, suggesting that these cells form an indispensible part of the
somatosensory system.

Mechanisms of epithelial cell shedding in the Mammalian intestine and maintenance
of barrier function.

The intestinal epithelium forms a barrier between the gut lumen and the body. The
barrier is potentially challenged by the high turnover of epithelial cells being 
shed. Our laboratories have shown that the epithelium is punctuated by
discontinuities called "gaps" that have the diameter of an epithelial cell and
are devoid of cellular contents. At least a proportion of gaps are formed by the 
shedding of epithelial cells. These gaps are filled with an unknown substance
that maintains local barrier function. Gaps have been identified in the mouse by 
in vivo confocal microscopy and in humans by confocal endomicroscopy. They can be
distinguished from goblet cells by the absence of a nucleus and are found in
Math1-/- mice where goblet cells are absent. Cell shedding and gap formation is
increased by TNF-alpha. Barrier function is lost after TNF-alpha in approximately
20% of shedding events. These observations suggest that loss of barrier function 
at sites of cell shedding may be important in intestinal diseases where an
increase in epithelial permeability plays a role in pathogenesis.

Scavenger chemokine (CXC motif) receptor 7 (CXCR7) is a direct target gene of
HIC1 (hypermethylated in cancer 1).

The tumor suppressor gene HIC1 (Hypermethylated in Cancer 1) that is
epigenetically silenced in many human tumors and is essential for mammalian
development encodes a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor. The few genes 
that have been reported to be directly regulated by HIC1 include ATOH1, FGFBP1,
SIRT1, and E2F1. HIC1 is thus involved in the complex regulatory loops modulating
p53-dependent and E2F1-dependent cell survival and stress responses. We performed
genome-wide expression profiling analyses to identify new HIC1 target genes,
using HIC1-deficient U2OS human osteosarcoma cells infected with adenoviruses
expressing either HIC1 or GFP as a negative control. These studies identified
several putative direct target genes, including CXCR7, a G-protein-coupled
receptor recently identified as a scavenger receptor for the chemokine
SDF-1/CXCL12. CXCR7 is highly expressed in human breast, lung, and prostate
cancers. Using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analyses, we demonstrated
that CXCR7 was repressed in U2OS cells overexpressing HIC1. Inversely,
inactivation of endogenous HIC1 by RNA interference in normal human WI38
fibroblasts results in up-regulation of CXCR7 and SIRT1. In silico analyses
followed by deletion studies and luciferase reporter assays identified a
functional and phylogenetically conserved HIC1-responsive element in the human
CXCR7 promoter. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and ChIP upon ChIP
experiments demonstrated that endogenous HIC1 proteins are bound together with
the C-terminal binding protein corepressor to the CXCR7 and SIRT1 promoters in
WI38 cells. Taken together, our results implicate the tumor suppressor HIC1 in
the transcriptional regulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR7, a key player in
the promotion of tumorigenesis in a wide variety of cell types.

Acute small intestinal allograft rejection presents clinically as an abrupt
increase in ileal fluid output in the absence of extensive inflammation. We
questioned whether acute intestinal rejection might be accompanied by a
disturbance of normal intestinal stem cell differentiation. We examined the
intestinal epithelial secretory cell lineage among patients experiencing early
rejection before and during rejection as well as following corrective therapy.
Lineage-specific progenitors were identified by their expression of
stage-specific transcription factors. Progenitors of the enteroendocrine cell
(EEC) expressing neurogenin-3 (NEUROG3) were found to be disproportionately
reduced in numbers, along with their more mature EEC derivatives expressing neuro
D; the enteric hormone PYY was the most profoundly depleted of all the EEC
products evaluated. No change in the numbers of goblet or Paneth cells was
observed. Steroid treatment resulted in resolution of clinical symptoms,
restoration of normal patterns of EEC differentiation and recovery of normal
levels of enteric hormones. Acute intestinal rejection is associated with a loss 
of certain subtypes of EEC, most profoundly, those expressing PYY. Deficiency of 
the mature EECs appears to occur as a consequence of a mechanism that depletes
NEUROG3 EEC progenitors. Our study highlights the dynamics of the EEC lineage
during acute intestinal rejection.

Repair of the vestibular system via adenovector delivery of Atoh1: a potential
treatment for balance disorders.

Baker K(1), Brough DE, Staecker H.

Author information: 
(1)University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.

Loss of auditory and vestibular hair cells is a common cause of hearing loss and 
balance disorders. A variety of strategies have been proposed to restore function
to damaged inner ear neuroepithelium. Delivery of the atonal homolog, atoh1, has 
been demonstrated to induce recovery of auditory and vestibular hair cells using 
a variety of delivery methods and model systems. We have developed a mouse model 
of vestibular aminoglycoside ototoxicity and demonstrated that delivery of an
advanced generation adenovector that expresses atoh1 results in the regeneration 
of vestibular hair cells. Additionally, mice treated with atoh1 recover balance
function. Currently vestibular diseases have few treatment options and several
lines of evidence suggest that regeneration of hair cells may be more easily
accomplished in the vestibular system. Development of atoh1-based gene therapy
for vestibular hair cell loss may provide an initial opportunity for developing
gene therapy for inner ear disease.

Gene therapy in the inner ear using adenovirus vectors.

Husseman J(1), Raphael Y.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University of California,
San Diego, CA, USA.

Therapies for the protection and regeneration of auditory hair cells are of great
interest given the significant monetary and lifestyle impact of hearing loss. The
past decade has seen tremendous advances in the use of adenoviral vectors to
achieve these aims. Preliminary data demonstrated the functional capacity of this
technique as adenoviral-induced expression of neurotrophic and growth factors
protected hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons from ototoxic insults.
Subsequent efforts confirmed the feasibility of adenoviral transfection of cells 
in the auditory neuroepithelium via cochleostomy into the scala media. Most
recently, efforts have focused on regeneration of depleted hair cells. Mammalian 
hearing loss is generally considered a permanent insult as the auditory
epithelium lacks a basal layer capable of producing new hair cells. Recently, the
transcription factor Atoh1 has been found to play a critical role in hair cell
differentiation. Adenoviral-mediated overexpression of Atoh1 in culture and in
vivo have shown the ability to regenerate auditory and vestibular hair cells by
causing transdifferentiation of neighboring epithelial-supporting cells.
Functional recovery of both the auditory and vestibular systems has been
documented following adenoviral induced Atoh1 overexpression.

distinct bHLH transcription factors, Ptf1a and Atoh1.

The cochlear nucleus (CN), which consists of dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei
(DCN and VCN), plays pivotal roles in processing and relaying auditory
information to the brain. Although it contains various types of neurons, the
origins of the distinct subtypes and their developmental molecular machinery are 
still elusive. Here we reveal that two basic helix-loop-helix transcription
factors play crucial roles in specifying neuron subtypes in the CN. Pancreatic
transcription factor 1a (Ptf1a) and atonal homolog 1 (Atoh1) were found to be
expressed in discrete dorsolateral regions of the embryonic neuroepithelia of the
middle hindbrain (rhombomeres 2-5). Genetic lineage tracing using mice that
express Cre recombinase from the Ptf1a locus or under the control of the Atoh1
promoter revealed that inhibitory (GABAergic and glycinergic) or excitatory
(glutamatergic) neurons of both DCN and VCN are derived from the Ptf1a- and
Atoh1-expressing neuroepithelial regions, respectively. In the Ptf1a or Atoh1
null embryos, production of inhibitory or excitatory neurons, respectively, was
severely inhibited in the CN. These findings suggest that inhibitory and
excitatory subtypes of CN neurons are defined by Ptf1a and Atoh1, respectively
and, furthermore, provide important insights into understanding the machinery of 
neuron subtype specification in the dorsal hindbrain.

Epithelial stem cell-related alterations in Trichinella spiralis-infected small
intestine.

OBJECTIVES: Infection of mice with the parasite Trichinella spiralis leads to
small intestinal inflammation, characterized by changes in mucosal architecture
and subpopulations of epithelial cells. This model has been used to explore
changes in the epithelial proliferative cell population and expression of
transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Histochemical and immunohistochemical studies were
undertaken in duodenal samples. Location and number of Ki-67-positive cells were 
assessed using Score and Wincrypts program. Changes in mRNA transcripts were
studied by real-time RT-PCR.
RESULTS: T. spiralis infection induced an increase in total number of
proliferative (Ki-67-positive) cells per half crypt on day 2 post-infection.
Transcription of Math1, a transcription factor required for secretory cell
differentiation in the intestine, was up-regulated on days 6-18 post-infection.
At these time points, numbers of Paneth cells at the crypt base were also
increased and the epithelial proliferative zone was shifted up the crypt-villus
axis. Transcription of TGF-beta isoforms within the small intestine was
up-regulated on days 6 and 12 post-infection, but anti-TGF-beta antibody
treatment had no effect on T. spiralis-induced changes in mucosal architecture or
increase in Paneth/intermediate cells.
CONCLUSIONS: T. spiralis infection promotes an initial increase in small
intestinal epithelial proliferation and subsequent cell differentiation along the
secretory cell lineage. The resulting increase in numbers of Paneth cells at the 
crypt base causes the proliferative zone to move up the crypt-villus axis.
Further studies are required to determine the significance of an increase in the 
expression of TGF-beta transcripts.

The linear nucleus (Li) is a prominent cell group in the caudal hindbrain, which 
was first described in a study of cerebellar afferents in the rat by [Watson,
C.R.R., Switzer, R.C. III, 1978. Trigeminal projections to cerebellar tactile
areas in the rat origin mainly from N. interpolaris and N. principalis. Neurosci.
Lett. 10, 77-82.]. It was named for its elongated appearance in transverse
sections. Since this original description in the rat, reference to the nucleus
seems to have been largely absent from experimental studies of mammalian
precerebellar nuclei. We therefore set out to define the cytoarchitecture,
cerebellar connections, and molecular characteristics of Li in the mouse. In
coronal Nissl sections at the level of the rostral inferior olive, it consists of
two parallel bands of cells joined at their dorsal apex by a further band of
cells, making the shape of the Greek capital letter pi. Our three-dimensional
reconstruction demonstrated that the nucleus is continuous with the lateral
reticular nucleus (LRt) and that the ambiguus nucleus sits inside the arch of Li.
Cerebellar horseradish peroxidase injections confirmed that the cells of Li
project to cerebellum. We have shown that Li cells express Atoh1 and Wnt1 lineage
markers that are known to label the rhombic lip derived precerebellar nuclei. We 
have examined the relationship of Li cells to a number of molecular markers, and 
have found that many of the cells express a nonphosphorylated epitope in
neurofilament H (SMI 32), a feature they share with the LRt. The mouse Li
therefore appears to be a rostrodorsal extension of the LRt.

Goblet cells are mucin-secreting intestinal cells forming the mucus layer that
protects the mucosal surface. Ulcerative colitis (UC) has been associated with a 
defective colonic mucus layer and a reduced number of goblet cells. In
experimental animals, colonic goblet cell differentiation is regulated by
interacting transcription factors Hath1, KLF4 and the Notch, as well as Wnt
pathways, whereas data in humans are limited. We investigated goblet cell
differentiation factors and mucins in controls and in inflammatory bowel diseases
(IBDs). We performed real-time PCR for Hath1, KLF4, several ligands, receptors
and target genes of the Notch and Wnt pathways, as well as several mucins in
biopsies from the sigmoid colon of controls (n=21), Crohn's disease (CD, n=48)
and UC (n=40). In addition, Hath1 protein was quantitated with Western blot and
localized with immunohistochemistry. Notably, the degree of inflammation as
measured by IL-8 and histology was similar in both disease entities. The
proportion of goblet cells was lowered in both IBDs, but specifically diminished 
in the upper third of the crypt in UC. Comparable levels of inflammation induced 
both Hath1 (2.0-fold, p<0.001) and KLF4 (1.8-fold for KLF4, p=0.031) mRNA
expression in CD but not in UC (0.8-0.9-fold, ns). The differential induction was
confirmed for Hath1 protein using Western blot. Hath1 immunostaining was found
mostly in the lower half of the colonic crypts. Hath1, KLF4 and the Notch target 
gene Hes1 were significantly (p<0.001) and positively correlated. Moreover, both 
Hath1 and KLF4 were correlated (p<0.001) with MUC1, MUC2 as well as MUC4 in all
control and IBD cohorts. The results indicate that both transcription factors are
key regulators of goblet cell differentiation and mucin formation in the human
colon. Conspicuously, inflammation is associated with an enhanced goblet cell
differentiation in CD but not in UC, a defect possibly of pathogenic importance.

The acquisition of terminal cell fate and onset of differentiation are instructed
by cell type-specific master control genes. Loss of differentiation is frequently
observed during cancer progression, but the underlying causes and mechanisms
remain poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that master regulators of
differentiation may be key regulators of tumor formation. Using loss- and
gain-of-function analyses in Drosophila, we describe a critical anti-oncogenic
function for the atonal transcription factor in the fly retina, where atonal
instructs tissue differentiation. In the tumor context, atonal acts by regulating
cell proliferation and death via the JNK stress response pathway. Combined with
evidence that atonal's mammalian homolog, ATOH1, is a tumor suppressor gene, our 
data support a critical, evolutionarily conserved, function for ato in
oncogenesis.

Colon cancer accounts for more than 10% of all cancer deaths annually. Our
genetic evidence from Drosophila and previous in vitro studies of mammalian
Atonal homolog 1 (Atoh1, also called Math1 or Hath1) suggest an anti-oncogenic
function for the Atonal group of proneural basic helix-loop-helix transcription
factors. We asked whether mouse Atoh1 and human ATOH1 act as tumor suppressor
genes in vivo. Genetic knockouts in mouse and molecular analyses in the mouse and
in human cancer cell lines support a tumor suppressor function for ATOH1. ATOH1
antagonizes tumor formation and growth by regulating proliferation and apoptosis,
likely via activation of the Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway.
Furthermore, colorectal cancer and Merkel cell carcinoma patients show genetic
and epigenetic ATOH1 loss-of-function mutations. Our data indicate that ATOH1 may
be an early target for oncogenic mutations in tissues where it instructs cellular
differentiation.

The growth of many cancers depends on self-renewing cells called cancer stem
cells or tumor-propagating cells (TPCs). In human brain tumors, cells expressing 
the stem cell marker CD133 have been implicated as TPCs. Here we show that tumors
from a model of medulloblastoma, the Patched mutant mouse, are propagated not by 
CD133(+) cells but by cells expressing the progenitor markers Math1 and
CD15/SSEA-1. These cells have a distinct expression profile that suggests
increased proliferative capacity and decreased tendency to undergo apoptosis and 
differentiation. CD15 is also found in a subset of human medulloblastomas, and
tumors expressing genes similar to those found in murine CD15(+) cells have a
poorer prognosis. Thus, CD15 may represent an important marker for TPCs in
medulloblastoma.

Notch signaling and Hes labeling in the normal and drug-damaged organ of Corti.

MSRB-3, 1150 West Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-5648, USA.

During the development of the inner ear, the Notch cell signaling pathway is
responsible for the specification of the pro-sensory domain and influences cell
fate decisions. It is assumed that Notch signaling ends during maturity and
cannot be reinitiated to alter the fate of new or existing cells in the organ of 
Corti. This is in contrast to non-mammalian species which reinitiate Delta
1-Notch1 signaling in response to trauma in the auditory epithelium, resulting in
hair cell regeneration through transdifferentiation and/or mitosis. We report
immunohistochemical data and Western protein analysis showing that in the
aminoglycoside-damaged guinea pig organ of Corti, there is an increase in
proteins involved in Notch activation occurring within 24h of a chemical hair
cell lesion. The signaling response is characterized by the increased presence of
Jagged1 ligand in pillar and Deiters cells, Notch1 signal in surviving supporting
cell nuclei, and the absence of Jagged2 and Delta-like1. The pro-sensory bHLH
protein Atoh1 was absent at all time points following an ototoxic lesion, while
the repressor bHLH transcription factors Hes1 and Hes5 were detected in surviving
supporting cell nuclei in the former inner and outer hair cell areas,
respectively. Notch pathway proteins peaked at 2 weeks, decreased at 1 month, and
nearly disappeared by 2 months. These results indicate that the mammalian
auditory epithelium retains the ability to regulate Notch signaling and
Notch-dependent Hes activity in response to cellular trauma and that the
signaling is transient. Additionally, since Hes activity antagonizes the
transcription of pro-sensory Atoh1, the presence of Hes after a lesion may
prohibit the occurrence of transdifferentiation in the surviving supporting
cells.

The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionary conserved mechanism that plays an 
important role in cell-cell communication and cell fate in a wide range of
tissues. The mammalian family of Notch receptors consists of 4 members:
Notch1/2/3/4. The Notch ligand family consists of 5 members: Delta1/3/4 and
Jagged1/2. Math1 encodes a murine basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription
factor that acts as positive regulator of cell differentiation. Recently, links
between Notch and Math1 pathways were demonstrated in various tissues. Expression
of Notch1, Jagged2 and Math1 were analyzed in the mouse molar tooth germ during
embryonic stage (E) 13 and E15 and during postnatal stage (PN) 1, PN3, PN5, PN10 
and PN14 by using in situ hybridization. Positive Notch1 expression was found at 
the tooth bud during embryonic stages, but its expression was absent from the
basal cells in contact with the dental mesenchyme. Jagged2 and Math1 were
strongly expressed in differentiated ameloblasts and odontoblasts and Math1
strong expression was even maintained until PN14 stage. Math1 showed the
strongest expression. Our results suggest that the Notch1 signaling pathway
through Jagged2 could be importantly related to Math1, directing the process of
odontogenesis toward cell differentiation.

Hey2 regulation by FGF provides a Notch-independent mechanism for maintaining
pillar cell fate in the organ of Corti.

Angeles, CA 90057, USA.

The organ of Corti, the auditory organ of the inner ear, contains two types of
sensory hair cells and at least seven types of supporting cells. Most of these
supporting cell types rely on Notch-dependent expression of Hes/Hey transcription
factors to maintain the supporting cell fate. Here, we show that Notch signaling 
is not necessary for the differentiation and maintenance of pillar cell fate,
that pillar cells are distinguished by Hey2 expression, and that-unlike other
Hes/Hey factors-Hey2 expression is Notch independent. Hey2 is activated by FGF
and blocks hair cell differentiation, whereas mutation of Hey2 leaves pillar
cells sensitive to the loss of Notch signaling and allows them to differentiate
as hair cells. We speculate that co-option of FGF signaling to render Hey2 Notch 
independent also liberated pillar cells from the need for direct contact with
surrounding hair cells, and enabled evolutionary remodeling of the complex
cellular mosaic of the inner ear.

At spinal levels, sensory information pertaining to body positioning
(proprioception) is relayed to the cerebellum by the spinocerebellar tracts
(SCTs). In the past we revealed the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor
Atoh1 (Math1) to be important for establishing Dorsal Progenitor 1 (DP1)
commissural interneurons, which comprise a subset of proprioceptive interneurons.
Given there exists multiple subdivisions of the SCT we asked whether Atoh1 may
also play a role in specifying other cell types in the spinal cord. Here, we
reveal the generation of at least three DP1 derived interneuron populations that 
reside at spatially restricted positions along the rostral-caudal axis. Each of
these cell populations expresses distinct markers and anatomically coincides with
the cell bodies of the various subdivisions of the SCT. In addition, we found
that as development proceeds (e.g. by E13.5) Atoh1 expression becomes apparent in
the dorsal midline in the region of the roof plate (RP). Interestingly, we find
that cells derived from Atoh1 expressing RP progenitors express SSEA-1, and in
the absence of Atoh1 these progenitors become SOX9 positive. Altogether we reveal
the existence of multiple Atoh1 dependent cell types in the spinal cord, and
uncover a novel progenitor domain that arises late in development.

Sox2 signaling in prosensory domain specification and subsequent hair cell
differentiation in the developing cochlea.

Sox2 is a high-mobility transcription factor that is one of the earliest markers 
of developing inner ear prosensory domains. In humans, mutations in SOX2 cause
sensorineural hearing loss and a loss of function study in mice showed that Sox2 
is required for prosensory formation in the cochlea. However, the specific roles 
of Sox2 have not been determined. Here we illustrate a dynamic role of Sox2 as an
early permissive factor in prosensory domain formation followed by a mutually
antagonistic relationship with Atoh1, a bHLH protein necessary for hair cell
development. We demonstrate that decreased levels of Sox2 result in precocious
hair cell differentiation and an over production of inner hair cells and that
these effects are likely mediated through an antagonistic interaction between
Sox2 and the bHLH molecule Atoh1. Using gain- and loss-of-function experiments we
provide evidence for the molecular pathway responsible for the formation of the
cochlear prosensory domain. Sox2 expression is promoted by Notch signaling and
Prox1, a homeobox transcription factor, is a downstream target of Sox2. These
results demonstrate crucial and diverse roles for Sox2 in the development,
specification, and maintenance of sensory cells within the cochlea.

Lmx1a is required for segregation of sensory epithelia and normal ear
histogenesis and morphogenesis.

Nichols DH(1), Pauley S, Jahan I, Beisel KW, Millen KJ, Fritzsch B.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biomedical Sciences, Creighton University, Omaha, NE, USA.

At embryonic day 8.5, the LIM-homeodomain factor Lmx1a is expressed throughout
the otic placode but becomes developmentally restricted to non-sensory epithelia 
of the ear (endolymphatic duct, ductus reuniens, cochlea lateral wall). We
confirm here that the ears of newborn dreher (Lmx1a (dr)) mutants are dysmorphic.
Hair cell markers such as Atoh1 and Myo7 reveal, for the first time, that newborn
Lmx1a mutants have only three sensory epithelia: two enlarged canal cristae and
one fused epithelium comprising an amalgamation of the cochlea, saccule, and
utricle (a "cochlear-gravistatic" endorgan). The enlarged anterior canal crista
develops by fusion of horizontal and anterior crista, whereas the posterior
crista fuses with an enlarged papilla neglecta that may extend into the cochlear 
lateral wall. In the fused endorgan, the cochlear region is distinguished from
the vestibular region by markers such as Gata3, the presence of a tectorial
membrane, and cochlea-specific innervation. The cochlea-like apex displays minor 
disorganization of the hair and supporting cells. This contrasts with the basal
half of the cochlear region, which shows a vestibular epithelium-like
organization of hair cells and supporting cells. The dismorphic features of the
cochlea are also reflected in altered gene expression patterns. Fgf8 expression
expands from inner hair cells in the apex to most hair cells in the base. Two
supporting cell marker proteins, Sox2 and Prox1, also differ in their cellular
distribution between the base and the apex. Sox2 expression expands in mutant
canal cristae prior to their enlargement and fusion and displays a more diffuse
and widespread expression in the base of the cochlear region, whereas Prox1 is
not detected in the base. These changes in Sox2 and Prox1 expression suggest that
Lmx1a expression restricts and sharpens Sox2 expression, thereby defining
non-sensory and sensory epithelium. The adult Lmx1a mutant organ of Corti shows a
loss of cochlear hair cells, suggesting that the long-term maintenance of hair
cells is also disrupted in these mutants.

Just say no to ATOH: how HIC1 methylation might predispose medulloblastoma to
lineage addiction.

Briggs KJ(1), Eberhart CG, Watkins DN.

Hypermethylated in cancer-1 (HIC1) is a tumor suppressor frequently targeted for 
promoter hypermethylation in medulloblastoma, an embryonal tumor of the
cerebellum. Recently, we showed that HIC1 is a direct transcriptional repressor
of ATOH1, a proneural transcription factor required for normal cerebellar
development, as well as for medulloblastoma cell viability. Because demethylating
agents can induce reexpression of silenced tumor suppressors, restoring HIC1
function may present an attractive therapeutic avenue in medulloblastoma by
exploiting an apparent addiction to ATOH1.

transfer.

Sensory hair cells in the mammalian cochlea convert mechanical stimuli into
electrical impulses that subserve audition. Loss of hair cells and their
innervating neurons is the most frequent cause of hearing impairment. Atonal
homologue 1 (encoded by Atoh1, also known as Math1) is a basic helix-loop-helix
transcription factor required for hair-cell development, and its misexpression in
vitro and in vivo generates hair-cell-like cells. Atoh1-based gene therapy to
ameliorate auditory and vestibular dysfunction has been proposed. However, the
biophysical properties of putative hair cells induced by Atoh1 misexpression have
not been characterized. Here we show that in utero gene transfer of Atoh1
produces functional supernumerary hair cells in the mouse cochlea. The induced
hair cells display stereociliary bundles, attract neuronal processes and express 
the ribbon synapse marker carboxy-terminal binding protein 2 (refs 12,13).
Moreover, the hair cells are capable of mechanoelectrical transduction and show
basolateral conductances with age-appropriate specializations. Our results
demonstrate that manipulation of cell fate by transcription factor misexpression 
produces functional sensory cells in the postnatal mammalian cochlea. We expect
that our in utero gene transfer paradigm will enable the design and validation of
gene therapies to ameliorate hearing loss in mouse models of human deafness.

Manipulating Robo expression in vivo perturbs commissural axon pathfinding in the
chick spinal cord.

In vertebrate embryos, most spinal commissural axons cross the ventral midline
(VM) and project either alongside or significant distances away from the floor
plate (FP). The upregulation of repulsive Robo1/2 receptors on postcrossing
commissural axons, in mammals, presumably allows these axons to respond to the
midline-associated repellents, Slit1-3, facilitating their expulsion from, and
prohibiting their reentry into, the FP. Compelling data suggest that Robo3
represses Robo1/2 function on precrossing axons and that Robo1/2 inhibit
attractive guidance receptors on postcrossing axons, thereby ensuring that
decussated axons are selectively responsive to midline Slits. However, whether
Robo1/2 expel decussated commissural axons from the VM and/or prevent their
reentry into the FP has not been explicitly established in vivo. Furthermore,
some commissural axons do not require Robo1/2 to elaborate appropriate
contralateral projections in the mouse spinal cord. Here, we use unilateral in
ovo electroporation together with Atoh1 and Neurog1 enhancer elements to
visualize, and assess the consequences of manipulating Robo expression on, dl1
and dl2 chick commissural axons. In response to misexpressing a cytoplasmic
truncation of Robo1 and/or Robo2, which should block all Robo-ligand
interactions, postcrossing commissural axons extend alongside, but do not project
away from or reenter the FP. In contrast, misexpression of full-length Robo2
prevents many commissural axons from crossing the VM. Together, these findings
support key and selective in vivo roles for Robo receptors in presumably altering
the responsiveness of decussated commissural axons and facilitating their
expulsion from the VM within the chick spinal cord.

Transcriptional cascade from Math1 to Mbh1 and Mbh2 is required for cerebellar
granule cell differentiation.

Kawauchi D(1), Saito T.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Developmental Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba
University, Chiba, Japan.

Cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) are the most abundant neuronal type in the
mammalian brain, and their differentiation is regulated by the basic
helix-loop-helix gene, Math1. However, little is known about downstream genes of 
Math1 and their functions in the cerebellum. To investigate them, we have here
established an electroporation-based in vivo gene transfer method in the
developing mouse cerebellum. Misexpression of Math1 ectopically induced
expression of Bar-class homeobox genes, Mbh1 and Mbh2, which are expressed by
CGCs. Conversely, their expression was repressed in CGCs by knockdown of Math1.
These findings, taken together with chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, suggest
that Math1 directly regulates the Mbh genes in CGCs. Furthermore, a
dominant-negative form of the Mbh proteins disrupted proper formation of the
external granule layer and differentiation of CGCs, whereas misexpression of the 
Mbh genes ectopically induced expression of a CGC marker in nonneuronal cells,
indicating that the Mbh proteins are required for the differentiation of CGCs.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Hath1 (human atonal homolog 1)
overexpression on greater epithelial ridge (GER) cells from postnatal rat cochlea
in vitro.
METHODS: GER cells were isolated by using a combinatorial approach of enzymatic
digestion and mechanical separation from P1 rat cochlear. The GER cell cultures
were infected by adenovirus containing Hath1 and enhanced green fluorescent
protein (ad-Hath1-EGFP), while transfecting EGFP(ad-EGFP) was as controls.
Immunostaining were performed at different time points after adenovirus
infection.
RESULTS: Some of the infected GER cells became myosin VIIa-positive following
ad-Hath1-EGFP infection. The earliest time point to see induction of hair cell
differentiation (hair cell marker expression) by ad-Hathl was 5 days
post-infection. In contrast, infection of the GER sheet cultures with ad-EGFP
control virus did not show any myosin VIIa-positive cells at 3-12 days
post-infection in all cultures examined.
CONCLUSIONS: GER cells may potentially serve as hair cell progenitors and they
are capable of differentiating hair cell-like cells when forced to express Hath1.

Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children, but the
cells from which it arises remain unclear. Here we examine the origin of
medulloblastoma resulting from mutations in the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway. We 
show that activation of Shh signaling in neuronal progenitors causes
medulloblastoma by 3 months of age. Shh pathway activation in stem cells promotes
stem cell proliferation but only causes tumors after commitment to-and expansion 
of-the neuronal lineage. Notably, tumors initiated in stem cells develop more
rapidly than those initiated in progenitors, with all animals succumbing by 3-4
weeks. These studies suggest that medulloblastoma can be initiated in progenitors
or stem cells but that Shh-induced tumorigenesis is associated with neuronal
lineage commitment.

Inner ear hair cells and supporting cells arise from common precursors and, in
mammals, do not show phenotypic conversion. Here, we studied the role of the
homeodomain transcription factor Prox1 in the inner ear sensory epithelia.
Adenoviral-mediated Prox1 transduction into hair cells in explant cultures led to
strong repression of Atoh1 and Gfi1, two transcription factors critical for hair 
cell differentiation and survival. Luciferase assays showed that Prox1 can
repress transcriptional activity of Gfi1 independently of Atoh1. Prox1
transduction into cochlear outer hair cells resulted in degeneration of these
cells, consistent with the known phenotype of Gfi1-deficient mice. These results 
together with the widespread expression of endogenous Prox1 within the population
of inner ear supporting cells point to the role for Prox1 in antagonizing the
hair cell phenotype in these non-sensory cells. Further, in vivo analyses of hair
cells from Gfi1-deficient mice suggest that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
p57(Kip2) mediates the differentiation- and survival-promoting functions of Gfi1.
These data reveal novel gene interactions and show that these interactions
regulate cellular differentiation within the inner ear sensory epithelia. The
data point to the tight regulation of phenotypic characteristics of hair cells
and supporting cells.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol abuse during pregnancy injures the fetal brain. One of
alcohol's most important neuroteratogenic effects is neuronal loss. Rat models
have shown that the cerebellum becomes less vulnerable to alcohol-induced
neuronal death as it matures. We determined if maturation-dependent alcohol
resistance occurs in mice and compared patterns of gene expression during the
alcohol resistant and sensitive periods.
METHODS: Neonatal mice received alcohol daily over postnatal day (PD) 2 to 4 or
PD8 to 10. Purkinje cells and granule cells were quantified on PD25. The temporal
expression patterns of 4 neuro-developmental genes and 3 neuro-protective genes
in the cerebellum were determined daily over PD0 to 15 to determine how gene
expression changes as the cerebellum transitions from alcohol-vulnerable to
alcohol-resistant. The effect of alcohol on expression of these genes was
determined when the cerebellum is alcohol sensitive (PD4) and resistant (PD10).
RESULTS: Purkinje and granule cells were vulnerable to alcohol-induced death at
PD2 to 4, but not at PD8 to 10. Acquisition of maturation-dependent alcohol
resistance coincided with changes in the expression of neurodevelopmental genes. 
The vulnerability of cerebellar neurons to alcohol toxicity declined in parallel 
with decreasing levels of Math1 and Cyclin D2, markers of immature granule cells.
Likewise, the rising resistance to alcohol toxicity paralleled increasing levels 
of GABA alpha-6 and Wnt-7a, markers of mature granule neurons. Expression of
growth factors and genes with survival promoting function (IGF-1, BDNF, and
cyclic AMP response element binding protein) did not rise as the cerebellum
transitioned from alcohol-vulnerable to alcohol-resistant. All 3 were expressed
at substantial levels during the vulnerable period and were not expressed at
higher levels later. Acute alcohol exposure altered the expression of
neurodevelopmental genes and growth factor genes when administered either during 
the alcohol vulnerable period or resistant period. However, the patterns in which
gene expression changed varied among the genes and depended on timing of alcohol 
administration.
CONCLUSIONS: Mice have a temporal window of vulnerability in the first week of
life, during which cerebellar neurons are more sensitive to alcohol toxicity than
during the second week. Expression of genes governing neuronal maturation changes
in synchrony with the acquisition of alcohol resistance. Growth factors do not
rise as the cerebellum transitions from alcohol-vulnerable to alcohol-resistant. 
Thus, a process intrinsic to neuronal maturation, rather than rising levels of
growth factors, likely underlies maturation-dependent alcohol resistance.

Comparative analysis of proneural gene expression in the embryonic cerebellum.

Author information:

The embryonic cerebellum contains two germinative epithelia: the rhombic lip and 
the ventricular zone. While the lineage of glutamatergic neurons arising from the
rhombic lip has been characterized, plenty remains to be learned about the
factors giving rise to the array of ventricular zone-derived gamma-aminobutyric
acid (GABA)ergic neurons. In the present study, we describe the expression of
proneural genes Mash1/Ascl1, Ngn1/Neurog1, and Ngn2/Neurog2 in the cerebellar
primordium at key stages of Purkinje cell and interneuron development, and
compare them with the expression of other genes active in the same context. Our
results indicate that Ngn1, Ngn2 and Mash1 are expressed at relevant stages of
cerebellar neurogenesis in the prospective cerebellar nuclei and in the
ventricular zone, excluding the Math1/Atoh1-positive rhombic lip. Their
expression domains are only partially overlapping, suggesting that they may
contribute selectively to ventricular zone regionalization, giving rise to the
diversity of cerebellar GABA neurons and, possibly, Purkinje cell subtypes.

Following hair cell elimination in severely traumatized cochleae, differentiated 
supporting cells are often replaced by a simple epithelium with cuboidal or flat 
appearance. Atoh1 (previously Math1) is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription
factor critical to hair cell differentiation during mammalian embryogenesis.
Forced expression of Atoh1 in the differentiated supporting cell population can
induce transdifferentiation leading to hair cell regeneration. Here, we examined 
the outcome of adenovirus mediated over-expression of Atoh1 in the non-sensory
cells of the flat epithelium. We determined that seven days after unilateral
elimination of hair cells with neomycin, differentiated supporting cells are
absent, replaced by a flat epithelium. Nerve processes were also missing from the
auditory epithelium, with the exception of infrequent looping nerve processes
above the habenula perforata. We then inoculated an adenovirus vector with Atoh1 
insert into the scala media of the deafened cochlea. The inoculation resulted in 
upregulation of Atoh1 in the flat epithelium. However, two months after the
inoculation, Atoh1-treated ears did not exhibit clear signs of hair cell
regeneration. Combined with previous data on induction of supporting cell to hair
cell transdifferentiation by forced expression of Atoh1, these results suggest
that the presence of differentiated supporting cells in the organ of Corti is
necessary for transdifferentiation to occur.

Stem cells and molecular strategies to restore hearing.

(1)Department of Biomedical Sciences, Creighton University, Omaha, NE 68178, USA.

Hearing loss is a costly and growing problem for the elderly population worldwide
with millions of people being affected. There are currently two prosthetic
devices available to minimize problems associated with the two forms of hearing
loss: hearing aids that amplify sound to overcome middle ear based conductive
hearing loss and cochlear implants that restore some hearing after neurosensory
hearing loss. The current presentation provides information on the treatment of
neurosensory hearing loss. Although the cochlear implant solution for
neurosensory hearing loss is technologically advanced; it still provides only
moderate hearing capacity in neurosensory deaf individuals. Inducible stem cells 
and molecular therapies are appealing alternatives to the cochlear implant and
may provide more than a new form of treatment as they hold the promise for a
cure. To this end, current insights into inducible stem cells that may provide
cells for seeding the cochlea with the hope of new hair cell formation are being 
reviewed. Alternatively, similar to induction of stem cells, cells of the flat
epithelium that remains after hair cell loss could be induced to proliferate and 
differentiate into hair cells. In either of these strategies, hair cell specific 
genes known to be essential for hair cell differentiation or maintenance such as 
ATOH1, POU4F3, GFI1, and miRNA-183 will be utilized with the hope of completely
restoring hearing to all patients with hearing loss.

Ca(2+) signaling and neurotransmission modulate touch-evoked responses in Merkel 
cell-neurite complexes. To identify mechanisms governing these processes, we
analyzed voltage-activated ion channels and Ca(2+) signaling in purified Merkel

against voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels (Ca(V)2.1) and voltage- and
Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK(Ca)) channels. Voltage-clamp recordings revealed small 
Ca(2+) currents, which produced Ca(2+) transients that were amplified sevenfold
by Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release. Merkel cells' voltage-activated K(+) currents
were carried predominantly by BK(Ca) channels with inactivating and
non-inactivating components. Thus, Merkel cells, like hair cells, have
functionally diverse BK(Ca) channels. Finally, blocking K(+) channels increased
response magnitude and dramatically shortened Ca(2+) transients evoked by
mechanical stimulation. Together, these results demonstrate that Ca(2+) signaling
in Merkel cells is governed by the interplay of plasma membrane Ca(2+) channels, 
store release and K(+) channels, and they identify specific signaling mechanisms 
that may control touch sensitivity.

Medulloblastoma is an embryonal tumor thought to arise from the granule cell
precursors (GCPs) of the cerebellum. PATCHED (PTCH), an inhibitor of Hedgehog
signaling, is the best-characterized tumor suppressor in medulloblastoma.
However, <20% of medulloblastomas have mutations in PTCH. In the search for other
tumor suppressors, interest has focused on the deletion events at the 17p13.3
locus, the most common genetic defect in medulloblastoma. This chromosomal region
contains HYPERMETHYLATED IN CANCER 1 (HIC1), a transcriptional repressor that is 
a frequent target of epigenetic gene silencing in medulloblastoma. Here we use a 
mouse model of Ptch1 heterozygosity to reveal a critical tumor suppressor
function for Hic1 in medulloblastoma. When compared with Ptch1 heterozygous
mutants, compound Ptch1/Hic1 heterozygotes display a fourfold increased incidence
of medulloblastoma. We show that Hic1 is a direct transcriptional repressor of
Atonal Homolog 1 (Atoh1), a proneural transcription factor essential for
cerebellar development, and show that ATOH1 expression is required for human
medulloblastoma cell growth in vitro. Given that Atoh1 is also a putative target 
of Hh signaling, we conclude that the Hic1 and Ptch1 tumor suppressors cooperate 
to silence Atoh1 expression during a critical phase in GCP differentiation in
which malignant transformation may lead to medulloblastoma.

Comment in
    Genes Dev. 2008 Mar 15;22(6):693-9.

Bone morphogenic proteins 2 and 4 (BMP2 and BMP4) inhibit proliferation and
induce differentiation of cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) and
primary GNP-like medulloblastoma (MB) cells. This occurs through rapid
proteasome-mediated degradation of Math1 (Atoh1), a transcription factor
expressed in proliferating GNPs. Ectopic expression of Atoh1, but not of Sonic
hedgehog (Shh)-regulated Gli1 or Mycn, cancels these BMP-mediated effects and
restores Shh-dependent proliferation of GNPs and MB cells in vitro and in vivo.
Genes regulating the BMP signaling pathway are down-regulated in mouse MBs. Thus,
BMPs are potent inhibitors of MB and should be considered as novel therapeutic
agents.

Hepatoma-derived growth factor is a nuclear targeted mitogen containing a PWWP
domain that mediates binding to DNA. To date, almost nothing is known about the
molecular mechanisms of the functions of hepatoma-derived growth factor, its
routes of secretion and internalization or post-translational modifications. In
the present study, we show for the first time that hepatoma-derived growth factor
is modified by the covalent attachment of small ubiquitin-related modifier 1
(SUMO-1), a post-translational modification with regulatory functions for an
increasing number of proteins. Using a basal SUMOylation system in Escherichia
coli followed by a MALDI-TOF-MS based peptide analysis, we identified the lysine 
residue SUMOylated located in the N-terminal part of the protein adjacent to the 
PWWP domain. Surprisingly, this lysine residue is not part of the consensus motif
described for SUMOylation. With a series of hepatoma-derived growth factor
mutants, we then confirmed that this unusual location is also used in mammalian
cells and that SUMOylation of hepatoma-derived growth factor takes place in the
nucleus. Finally, we demonstrate that SUMOylated hepatoma-derived growth factor
is not binding to chromatin, in contrast to its unSUMOylated form. These
observations potentially provide new perspectives for a better understanding of
the functions of hepatoma-derived growth factor.

Atoh1 plays a crucial role in intestinal cell differentiation. We have
demonstrated that its human homolog Hath1 protein is targeted by the Wnt-GSK3
axis, resulting in the proteasomal degradation in human colon cancer. However,
the contribution of Hath1 degradation to the undifferentiated state of colon
cancer remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that both constitutive
expression of mutant Hath1 and stabilization of Hath1 protein by a GSK3 inhibitor
in colon cancer cells increased the expression of MUC2 known as a representative 
function of differentiated goblet cells. This means that Hath1 protein
degradation may be required for maintaining the undifferentiated state of colon
cancers, and that GSK3 inhibitors have potential for use in cancer therapy.

Breathing is a genetically determined behavior generated by neurons in the brain 
stem. Transcription factors, in part, determine the basic developmental identity 
of neurons, but the relationships between these genes and the neural populations 
generating and modulating respiration are unclear. The diversity of brain stem
populations has been proposed to result from a combinatorial code of
transcription factor expression corresponding to the anterior-posterior (A-P) and
dorsal-ventral (D-V) location of a neuron's birth. I provide a schematic of
transcription factor coding identifying at least 15 genetically distinct D-V
subdivisions of brain stem neurons that, combined with A-P patterning, may
provide a genetic organization of the brain stem in general, with the eventual
goal of describing respiratory populations in particular. Using a combination of 
fate mapping in transgenic mouse lines and immunohistochemistry, we confirm the
parabrachial nuclei are derived from a subset of Atoh1 expression progenitor
neurons. I hypothesize the Kölliker-Fuse nucleus can be uniquely defined in the
neonate mouse by the coexpression of the transcription factor FoxP2 in
Atoh1-derived neurons of rhombomere 1.

Barhl1 regulatory sequences required for cell-specific gene expression and
autoregulation in the inner ear and central nervous system.

The development of the nervous system requires the concerted actions of multiple 
transcription factors, yet the molecular events leading to their expression
remain poorly understood. Barhl1, a mammalian homeodomain transcription factor of
the BarH class, is expressed by developing inner ear hair cells, cerebellar
granule cells, precerebellar neurons, and collicular neurons. Targeted gene
inactivation has demonstrated a crucial role for Barhl1 in the survival and/or
migration of these sensory cells and neurons. Here we report the regulatory
sequences of Barhl1 necessary for directing its proper spatiotemporal expression 
pattern in the inner ear and central nervous system (CNS). Using a transgenic
approach, we have found that high-level and cell-specific expression of Barhl1
within the inner ear and CNS depends on both its 5' promoter and 3' enhancer
sequences. Further transcriptional, binding, and mutational analyses of the 5'
promoter have identified two homeoprotein binding motifs that can be occupied and
activated by Barhl1. Moreover, proper Barhl1 expression in inner ear hair cells
and cerebellar and precerebellar neurons requires the presence of Atoh1.
Together, these data delineate useful Barhl1 regulatory sequences that direct
strong and specific gene expression to inner ear hair cells and CNS sensory
neurons, establish a role for autoregulation in the maintenance of Barhl1
expression, and identify Atoh1 as a key upstream regulator.

Temporal and spatial coordination of multiple cell fate decisions is essential
for proper organogenesis. Here, we define gene interactions that transform the
neurogenic epithelium of the developing inner ear into specialized mechanosensory
receptors. By Cre-loxP fate mapping, we show that vestibular sensory hair cells
derive from a previously neurogenic region of the inner ear. The related bHLH
genes Ngn1 (Neurog1) and Math1 (Atoh1) are required, respectively, for neural and
sensory epithelial development in this system. Our analysis of mouse mutants
indicates that a mutual antagonism between Ngn1 and Math1 regulates the
transition from neurogenesis to sensory cell production during ear development.
Furthermore, we provide evidence that the transition to sensory cell production
involves distinct autoregulatory behaviors of Ngn1 (negative) and Math1
(positive). We propose that Ngn1, as well as promoting neurogenesis, maintains an
uncommitted progenitor cell population through Notch-mediated lateral inhibition,
and Math1 irreversibly commits these progenitors to a hair-cell fate.

Radiological, histological and molecular findings in an uncommon adult case of
cerebellar medulloblastoma suggested an external granular cell precursor origin. 
This 19-year-old woman had a 1-month history of progressively worsening headache.
Neuroimaging studies demonstrated a homogeneously enhanced well-circumscribed
mass lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere and she underwent surgery.
Postoperative neuronal imaging studies showed that the tumor located in the
cerebellar folia had been removed totally. Pathological examination identified it
as a desmoplastic medulloblastoma with subpial and subarachnoid infiltration and 
some infiltration into the molecular and granular layer via the perivascular
space. Polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical findings revealed the
presence of MATH-1, expressed in cerebellar external granule cell precursors
during fetal development, in the tumor cells. These findings suggest that the
tumor arose from external granule cell precursors of the cerebellum and that it
was therefore of neuronal lineage.

The gaseous messenger nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated in a wide range of
behaviors, including aggression, anxiety, depression, and cognitive functioning. 
To further elucidate the physiological role of NO and its down-stream mechanisms,
we conducted behavioral and expressional phenotyping of mice lacking the neuronal
isoform of nitric oxide synthase (NOS-I), the major source of NO in the central
nervous system. No differences were observed in activity-related parameters; in
contrast to the a priori hypothesis, derived from pharmacological treatments,
depression-related tests (Forced Swim Test, Learned Helplessness) also yielded no
significantly different results. A subtle anxiolytic phenotype however was
present, with knockdown mice displaying a higher open arm time as compared to
their respective wildtypes, yet all other investigated anxiety-related parameters
were unchanged. The most prominent feature however was gender-independent
cognitive impairment in spatial learning and memory, as assessed by the Water
Maze test and an automatized holeboard paradigm. No significant dysregulation of 
monoamine transporters was evidenced by qRT PCR. To further examine the
underlying molecular mechanisms, the transcriptome of knockdown animals was thus 
examined in the hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum by microarray analysis. A
set of >120 differentially expressed genes was identified, whereat the
hippocampus and the striatum showed similar expressional profiles as compared to 
the cerebellum in hierarchical clustering. Among the most significantly
up-regulated genes were Peroxiredoxon 3, Atonal homologue 1, Kcnj1, Kcnj8,
CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), alpha, 3 genes involved in GABA(B)
signalling and, intriguingly, the glucocorticoid receptor GR. While GABAergic
genes might underlie reduced anxiety, dysregulation of the glucocorticoid
receptor can well contribute to a blunted stress response as found in NOS1
knockdown mice. Furthermore, by CREB inhibition, glucocorticoid receptor
upregulation could at least partially explain cognitive deficits in these
animals. Taken together, NOS1 knockdown mice display a characteristic behavioural
profile consisting of reduced anxiety and impaired learning and memory,
paralleled by differential expression of the glucocorticoid receptor and
GABAergic genes. Further research has to assess the value of these mice as animal
models e.g. for Alzheimer's disease or attention deficit disorder, in order to
clarify a possible pathophysiological role of NO therein.

Mouse cerebellar development occurs at late embryonic stages and through the
first few weeks of postnatal life. Hormones such as 17-beta-estradiol (E2) have
been implicated in cerebellar development, through the expression of E2 receptors
(ER). However, the role of E2 in the development and function of cerebellar
neurons has yet to be fully elucidated. To gain insight into E2's actions on the 
developing cerebellum, we characterized a cloned neuronal cell line, E(t)C.1,
derived from late embryonic cerebellum for its neural properties and
responsiveness to E2. Our results revealed that E(t)C.1 cells express markers
characteristic of neural progenitor cells such as Nestin, Musashi, and
Doublecortin (DCX), and of the granule cell lineage such as Math1 and Zipro1. The
ER alpha and beta (ERalpha and ERbeta) were also identified in this cell line.
Functionality of ERs was verified using an Estrogen Response Element
(ERE)-Luciferase reporter plasmid. E2 modulated ERalpha, FMRP, and IL-6, which
were expressed in these cells. However, E2 did not induce changes in neural
proteins nor induce maturation of E(t)C.1 cells. CREB and ERK(1/2) protein
kinases were not modulated by E2 either. Interestingly, E(t)C.1 expressed active 
p450 Aromatase (P450arom), which was confirmed by the aromatization of
androstenedione (AD) to E2 and other estrogen metabolites. Collectively, our
results show that the E(t)C.1 cell line may serve as a model to study early
development of cerebellar progenitor granule cells, and their responsiveness to
E2.

Acetylcholine is a key neurotransmitter of the inner ear efferent system. In this
study, we identify two novel nAChR subunits in the inner ear: a1 and <U+03B3>, encoded
by Chrna1 and Chrng, respectively. In situ hybridization shows that the messages 
of these two subunits are present in vestibular and cochlear hair cells during
early development. Chrna1 and Chrng expression begin at embryonic stage E13.5 in 
the vestibular system and E17.5 in the organ of Corti. Chrna1 message continues
through P7, whereas Chrng is undetectable at post-natal stage P6. The a1 and <U+03B3>
subunits are known as muscle-type nAChR subunits and are surprisingly expressed
in hair cells which are sensory-neural cells. We also show that ATOH1/MATH1, a
transcription factor essential for hair cell development, directly activates
CHRNA1 transcription. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays and supershift assays
showed that ATOH1/E47 heterodimers selectively bind on two E boxes located in the
proximal promoter of CHRNA1. Thus, Chrna1 could be the first transcriptional
target of ATOH1 in the inner ear. Co-expression in Xenopus oocytes of the a1
subunit does not change the electrophysiological properties of the a9a10
receptor. We suggest that hair cells transiently express a1<U+03B3>-containing nAChRs in
addition to a9a10, and that these may have a role during development of the inner
ear innervation.

Deafness commonly results from a lesion of the sensory cells and/or of the
neurons of the auditory part of the inner ear. There are currently no treatments 
designed to halt or reverse the progression of hearing loss. A key goal in
developing therapy for sensorineural deafness is the identification of strategies
to replace lost hair cells. In amphibians and birds, a spontaneous post-injury
regeneration of all inner ear sensory hair cells occurs. In contrast, in the
mammalian cochlea, hair cells are only produced during embryogenesis. Many
studies have been carried out in order to demonstrate the persistence of
endogenous progenitors. The present review is first focused on the occurrence of 
spontaneous supernumerary hair cells and on nestin positive precursors found in
the organ of Corti. A second approach to regenerating hair cells would be to find
genes essential for their differentiation. This review will also focus on
critical genes for embryonic hair cell formation such as the cell cycle related
proteins, the Atoh1 gene and the Notch signaling pathway. Understanding
mechanisms that underlie hair cell production is an essential prerequisite to
defining therapeutic strategies to regenerate hair cells in the mature inner ear.

Foundation, 3333 Burnet Avenue, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.

Retinal ganglion cell genesis requires the proneural bHLH transcription factor
Math5 (Atoh7), but little is known about the regulatory elements that control its
expression. Here, we investigate Math5 gene regulation using transgenic mice.
These mice express GFP in the prenatal retina, live-labeling RGC axon migration
and innervation of the brain. Unexpectedly, these Math5-GFP transgenes are also
found in Math1 expression domains throughout the nervous system, intriguing since
Math5 and Math1 normally exhibit nonoverlapping expression. Furthermore,
Math5-GFP and Math1 are regulated similarly, by both Pax6 and Math1 itself, in
the lower rhombic lip and dorsal spinal cord. We also show that Pax6 binds to
particular Math5 and Math1 regulatory sequences in vitro. Together these data
suggest that these atonal semi-orthologues may share conserved regulatory
elements that are normally silent in the Math5 gene.

USA. kelleymt@nidcd.nih.gov

The organ of Corti, the sensory epithelium of the mammalian cochlea, develops
from a subset of cells located along the dorsal side (referred to as the floor)
of the cochlear duct. Over the course of embryonic development, cells within the 
developing organ of Corti become committed to develop as each of the unique cell 
types within the organ, including inner and outer hair cells, and at least four
different types of supporting cells. Moreover, these different cell types are
subsequently arranged into a highly rigorous cellular mosaic that includes the
formation of ordered rows of both hair cells and supporting cells. The events
that regulate both the location of the organ of Corti within the cochlear duct,
the specification of each cell type and cellular patterning remain poorly
understood. However, recent results have significantly improved our understanding
of the molecular, genetic and cellular factors that mediate some of the decisions
required for the development of this structure. In this review I will present an 
overview of cochlear development and then discuss some of the most recent and
enlightening results regarding the molecular mechanism underlying the formation
of this remarkable structure.

Mis-expression of L1 on pre-crossing spinal commissural axons disrupts
pathfinding at the ventral midline.

Parkway South, Bronx, NY 10461, USA.

In vertebrates, spinal commissural axons project along a transverse path toward
and across the floor plate (FP). Post-crossing commissural axons alter their
responsiveness to FP-associated guidance cues and turn to project longitudinally 
in a fasciculated manner prior to extending away from the midline. The
upregulation of the neural cell adhesion molecule L1 on crossed commissural axon 
segments has been proposed to facilitate pathfinding on the contralateral side of
the FP. To explore this possibility in vivo, we used Math1 regulatory sequences
to target L1 to commissural axons before they cross the ventral midline. L1
mis-expression did not alter the distribution of commissural axon-associated
markers or the ventral extension of commissural axons toward the midline.
However, commissural axons often stalled or inappropriately projected into the
longitudinal plane at the ipsilateral FP margin. These observations suggest that 
L1-mediated pathfinding decisions are normally delayed until axons have crossed
the ventral midline (VM).

Proneural factors represent <10 transcriptional regulators required for
specifying all of the different neurons of the mammalian nervous system. The
mechanisms by which such a small number of factors creates this diversity are
still unknown. We propose that proteins interacting with proneural factors confer
such specificity. To test this hypothesis we isolated proteins that interact with
Math1, a proneural transcription factor essential for the establishment of a
neural progenitor population (rhombic lip) that gives rise to multiple hindbrain 
structures and identified the E-protein Tcf4. Interestingly, haploinsufficiency
of TCF4 causes the Pitt-Hopkins mental retardation syndrome, underscoring the
important role for this protein in neural development. To investigate the
functional relevance of the Math1/Tcf4 interaction in vivo, we studied Tcf4(-/-) 
mice and found that they have disrupted pontine nucleus development.
Surprisingly, this selective deficit occurs without affecting other rhombic
lip-derived nuclei, despite expression of Math1 and Tcf4 throughout the rhombic
lip. Importantly, deletion of any of the other E-protein-encoding genes does not 
have detectable effects on Math1-dependent neurons, suggesting a specialized role
for Tcf4 in distinct neural progenitors. Our findings provide the first in vivo
evidence for an exclusive function of dimers formed between a proneural basic
helix-loop-helix factor and a specific E-protein, offering insight about the
mechanisms underlying transcriptional programs that regulate development of the
mammalian nervous system.

performed a genome-wide expression profiling analysis in cells expressing ATOH1
under the control of a tetracycline-off system and found that HES6 expression is 
induced by ATOH1. We performed in situ hybridisation and showed that the rise and
fall of Hes6 expression closely follow that of Atoh1 in cochlear HC. Moreover,
electrophoretic mobility shift assays and luciferase assays show that ATOH1
activates HES6 transcription through binding to three clustered E boxes of its
promoter.

Sensorineural hearing loss, which is often caused by degeneration of hair cells
in the auditory epithelium, is permanent because lost hair cells are not
replaced. Several conceptual approaches can be used to place new hair cells in
the auditory epithelium. One possibility is to enhance proliferation of
non-sensory cells that remain in the deaf ear and induce transdifferentiation of 
some of these cells into the hair cell phenotype. Several genes, including
p27(Kip1), have been shown to regulate proliferation and differentiation in the
developing auditory epithelium. The role of p27(Kip1) in the mature ear is not
well characterized. We now show that p27(Kip1) is present in the nuclei of
non-sensory cells of the mature auditory epithelium. We determined that forced
expression of Skp2 using a recombinant adenovirus vector, resulted in presence of
BrdU-positive cells in the auditory epithelium. When SKP2 over-expression was
combined with forced expression of Atoh1, ectopic hair cells were found in the
auditory epithelium in greater numbers than were seen with Atoh1 alone. Skp2
over-expression alone did not result in ectopic hair cells. These findings
suggest that the p27(Kip1) protein remains in the mature auditory epithelium and 
therefore p27(Kip1) can serve as a target for gene manipulation. The data also
suggest that induced proliferation, by itself, does not generate new hair cells
in the cochlea.

isolation.

The development of new stem cell-based technologies is creating new hopes in
regenerative medicine. Hearing-impaired individuals should benefit greatly from
the development of a cell-based regenerative strategy to treat deafness. An
important achievement would be to develop a human-based system that could bring
the advances made in animal models closer to clinical application. In this work, 
we have explored the suitability of the developing fetal cochlea to be used as a 
source for the extraction of auditory progenitor/stem cells. We have established 
cultures that express critical markers such as NESTIN, SOX2, GATA3 and PAX2.
These cultures can be expanded in vitro for several months and differentiating
markers such as ATOH1/HATH1 and POU4F3/BRN3C can be induced by manipulating the
culture conditions using specific growth factors such as bFGF, EGF and retinoic
acid.

Intestine-specific ablation of mouse atonal homolog 1 (Math1) reveals a role in
cellular homeostasis.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Math1 (Atoh1) is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor
important for intestinal secretory cell differentiation. We hypothesized that
Math1 is important in cell fate commitment, and therefore mediates proliferative 
homeostasis and the adaptive response following intestinal resection in the adult
intestine.
METHODS: We generated mice with an intestine-specific mosaic deletion of Math1
(Math1(Delta intestine)) using the Cre/loxP system. Histologic analysis in adult 
Math1(Delta intestine) and wild-type littermates at baseline and following small 
bowel resection or sham surgery was performed.
RESULTS: We observed loss of Paneth, goblet, and enteroendocrine cells in
Math1-null crypts. In addition, aberrant activation of the Math1 promoter
occurred in absorptive enterocytes derived from Math1-null crypts, suggesting a
change in cell fate. Proliferation was increased but apoptosis unchanged in
Math1-mutant crypts compared to adjacent wild-type crypts. Math1(Delta intestine)
mice and wild-type littermates displayed similar physiologic adaptive responses
to small bowel resection as measured by changes in body weight and ileal wet
weight. In contrast, Math1-mutant crypts displayed a blunted adaptive response
compared to adjacent wild-type crypts.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that Math1 is essential for adult intestinal secretory cell 
production, and in its absence cells destined to a secretory phenotype instead
adopt an absorptive phenotype. Subtle abnormalities of proliferation within
Math1-null crypts in Math1(Delta intestine) mice were identified, together with a
substantial defect in the adaptive response of Math1-null crypts following small 
bowel resection. Our results suggest that Math1 is critical for both cell fate
determination within the intestinal epithelium and for regulation of the response
to intestinal resection.

aberrant expression of the proneural gene atonal homolog 1 (ATOH1, HATH1, MATH1)

Microarray-based expression profiling studies of lung adenocarcinomas have
defined neuroendocrine subclasses with poor prognosis. As neuroendocrine
development is regulated by members of the achaete-scute and atonal classes of
basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, we analyzed lung tumors for 
expression of these factors. Out of 13 bHLH genes tested, 4 genes, i.e.,
achaete-scute complex-like 1 (ASCL1, HASH1, Mash1), atonal homolog 1 (ATOH1,
HATH1, MATH1), NEUROD4 (ATH-3, Atoh3, MATH-3) and neurogenic differentiation
factor 1 (NEUROD1, NEUROD, BETA2), showed differential expression among lung
tumors and absent or low expression in normal lung. As expected, tumors that have
high levels of ASCL1 also express neuroendocrine markers, and we found that this 
is accompanied by increased levels of NEUROD1. In addition, we found ATOH1
expression in 9 (16%) out of 56 analyzed adenocarcinomas and these tumors showed 
neuroendocrine features as shown by dopa decarboxylase mRNA expression and
immunostaining for neuroendocrine markers. ATOH1 expression as well as NEUROD4
was observed in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), a known neuroendocrine tumor.
Since ATOH1 is not known to be involved in normal lung development, our results
suggest that aberrant activation of ATOH1 leads to a neuroendocrine phenotype
similar to what is observed for ASCL1 activation during normal neuroendocrine
development and in lung malignancies. Our preliminary data indicate that patients
with ATOH1-expressing adenocarcinomas might have a worse prognosis.

To gain insight into the lineage of origin of medulloblastomas, the mRNA
expression of NEUROG1, a gene encoding a proneural transcription factor
transiently detected during nervous system development, was investigated in 27
human medulloblastomas characterized for mRNA expression of ATOH1, a marker of
cerebellar granule precursors and corresponding medulloblastomas. Expression of
Ngn1, the mouse homolog of NEUROG1, was also analyzed in the mouse cerebellar
primordium. In addition, we studied mRNA expression of GLI1 as a marker of the
SHH pathway activation, and nuclear beta-catenin staining, beta-catenin
mutations, and mRNA expression of MYC as indicators of the WNT pathway status. In
15 cases, we also examined expression of OTX2, a transcription factor recently
indicated as a positive marker of medulloblastomas originating from cerebellar
granule precursors. The mRNA expression of NEUROG1 and Ngn1 was selectively found
in medulloblastomas not expressing ATOH1 and in progenitors of the cerebellar
ventricular zone, respectively. GLI1 transcript was expressed in medulloblastomas
with ATOH1 transcript, whereas high levels of MYC transcript were unrelated to
NEUROG1 or ATOH1 expression. No clear association between MYC overexpression and 
nuclear beta-catenin staining was found. Finally, OTX2 mRNA was expressed in all 
medulloblastomas with NEUROG1 transcript, but also in a subset of these
malignancies with ATOH1 transcript. These observations may help to define the
lineage of origin of medulloblastomas, and support a role for ATOH1 and NEUROG1
in the classification of these malignancies.

Wild-type cells rescue genotypically Math1-null hair cells in the inner ears of
chimeric mice.

The transcription factor Math1 has been shown to be critical in the formation of 
hair cells (HCs) in the inner ear. However, the influence of environmental
factors in HC specification suggests that cell extrinsic factors are also crucial
to their development. To test whether extrinsic factors impact development of
Math1-null (Math1(beta-Gal/beta-Gal)) HCs, we examined neonatal (postnatal ages
P0-P4.5) Math1-null chimeric mice in which genotypically mutant and wild-type
cells intermingle to form the inner ear. We provide the first direct evidence
that Math1-null HCs are able to be generated and survive in the conducive
chimeric environment. beta-Galactosidase expression was used to identify
genetically mutant cells while cells were phenotypically defined as HCs by
morphological characteristics notably the expression of HC-specific markers.
Genotypically mutant HCs were found in all sensory epithelia of the inner ear at 
all ages examined. Comparable results were obtained irrespective of the wild-type
component of the chimeric mice. Thus, genotypically mutant cells retain the
competence to differentiate into HCs. The implication is that the lack of the
Math1 gene in HC precursors can be overcome by environmental influences, such as 
cell-cell interactions with wild-type cells, to ultimately result in the
formation of HCs.

BACKGROUND: During the embryonic development of the cerebellum, neurons are
produced from progenitor cells located along a ventricular zone within dorsal
rhombomere 1 that extends caudally to the roof plate of the fourth ventricle. The
apposition of the caudal neuroepithelium and roof plate results in a unique
inductive region termed the cerebellar rhombic lip, which gives rise to granule
cell precursors and other glutamatergic neuronal lineages. Recently, we and
others have shown that, at early embryonic stages prior to the emergence of
granule cell precursors (E12), waves of neurogenesis in the cerebellar rhombic
lip produce specific hindbrain nuclei followed by deep cerebellar neurons. How
the induction of rhombic lip-derived neurons from cerebellar progenitors is
regulated during this phase of cerebellar development to produce these temporally
discrete neuronal populations while maintaining a progenitor pool for subsequent 
neurogenesis is not known.
RESULTS: Employing both gain- and loss-of-function methods, we find that Notch1
signaling in the cerebellar primordium regulates the responsiveness of progenitor
cells to bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) secreted from the roof plate that
stimulate the production of rhombic lip-derived neurons. In the absence of
Notch1, cerebellar progenitors are depleted during the early production of
hindbrain neurons, resulting in a severe decrease in the deep cerebellar nuclei
that are normally born subsequently. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Notch1 
activity prevents the induction of Math1 by antagonizing the BMP
receptor-signaling pathway at the level of Msx2 expression.
CONCLUSION: Our results provide a mechanism by which a balance between neural
induction and maintenance of neural progenitors is achieved in the rhombic lip
throughout embryonic development.

HYPOTHESIS: Delivery of math1 using an adenovector (Admath1.11D) results in
vestibular hair cell regeneration and recovery of balance function in
ototoxin-treated adult mice.
BACKGROUND: Loss of peripheral vestibular function is associated with disease
processes such as vestibular neuronitis, aminoglycoside ototoxicity, and aging.
Loss of vestibular hair cells is one of the mechanisms underlying balance
dysfunction in all of these disorders. Currently, recovery from these diseases
relies on central vestibular compensation rather than on local tissue recovery.
Overexpression of the mammalian atonal homologue math1 has been demonstrated to
induce generation of hair cells in neonatal organ of Corti cultures and in the
guinea pig cochlea in vivo and could thus provide an approach to local tissue
recovery.
METHODS: Admath1.11D was applied to cultures of aminoglycoside-treated macular
organs or in vivo in a mouse aminoglycoside ototoxicity model. Outcome measures
included histologic examination, immunohistochemistry, swim testing, and
evaluation of the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex.
RESULTS: Delivery of math1 resulted in the generation of vestibular hair cells in
vitro after aminoglycoside-mediated loss of hair cells. Math1-treated mice showed
recovery of the vestibular neuroepithelium within 8 weeks after Admath1.11D
treatment. Assessment of animals after vector infusion demonstrated a recovery of
vestibular function compared with aminoglycoside-only-treated mice.
CONCLUSION: Molecular replacement of math1 may provide a therapeutic means of
restoring vestibular function related to vestibular hair cell loss.

Reciprocal targeting of Hath1 and beta-catenin by Wnt glycogen synthase kinase
3beta in human colon cancer.

(1)Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Graduate School, Tokyo Medical 
and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The transcription factor Hath1 plays a crucial role in the
differentiation program of the human gut epithelium. The present study was
conducted to investigate the molecular mechanism of Hath1 expression and its
close association with beta-catenin/glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta)
under the Wnt pathway in human colonocytes.
METHODS: Tissue distribution of Hath1 messenger RNA in human tissues was examined
by Northern blot. Stability of Hath1 protein was analyzed by expression of
FLAG-tagged Hath1 in human cell lines. Targeting of Hath1 protein by GSK3beta was
determined by specific inhibition of GSK-3beta function. Expression of Hath1
protein in colorectal cancers was examined by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Hath1 messenger RNA expression was confined to the lower
gastrointestinal tract in human adult tissues. In colon cancer cells, although
Hath1 messenger RNA was also detected, Hath1 protein was positively degradated by
proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Surprisingly, the GSK3beta-dependent protein
degradation was switched between Hath1 and beta-catenin by Wnt signaling, leading
to the dramatic alteration of cell status between proliferation and
differentiation, respectively. Hath1 protein was detected exclusively in normal
colon tissues but not in cancer tissues, where nuclear-localized beta-catenin was
present.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests a novel function of the canonical Wnt
signaling in human colon cancer cells, regulating cell proliferation and
differentiation by GSK3beta-mediated, reciprocal degradation of beta-catenin or
Hath1, respectively, which further emphasizes the importance of aberrant Wnt
signaling in colonocyte transformation.

The adult mammalian cochlea lacks regenerative capacity, which is the main reason
for the permanence of hearing loss. Vestibular organs, in contrast, replace a
small number of lost hair cells. The reason for this difference is unknown. In
this work we show isolation of sphere-forming stem cells from the early postnatal
organ of Corti, vestibular sensory epithelia, the spiral ganglion, and the stria 
vascularis. Organ of Corti and vestibular sensory epithelial stem cells give rise
to cells that express multiple hair cell markers and express functional ion
channels reminiscent of nascent hair cells. Spiral ganglion stem cells display
features of neural stem cells and can give rise to neurons and glial cell types. 
We found that the ability for sphere formation in the mouse cochlea decreases
about 100-fold during the second and third postnatal weeks; this decrease is
substantially faster than the reduction of stem cells in vestibular organs, which
maintain their stem cell population also at older ages. Coincidentally, the
relative expression of developmental and progenitor cell markers in the cochlea
decreases during the first 3 postnatal weeks, which is in sharp contrast to the
vestibular system, where expression of progenitor cell markers remains constant
or even increases during this period. Our findings indicate that the lack of
regenerative capacity in the adult mammalian cochlea is either a result of an
early postnatal loss of stem cells or diminishment of stem cell features of
maturing cochlear cells.

Zebrafish atoh1 genes: classic proneural activity in the inner ear and regulation
by Fgf and Notch.

Millimaki BB(1), Sweet EM, Dhason MS, Riley BB.

Author information: 
(1)Biology Department, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843-3258, USA.

Hair cells of the inner ear develop from an equivalence group marked by
expression of the proneural gene Atoh1. In mouse, Atoh1 is necessary for hair
cell differentiation, but its role in specifying the equivalence group (proneural
function) has been questioned and little is known about its upstream activators. 
We have addressed these issues in zebrafish. Two zebrafish homologs, atoh1a and
atoh1b, are together necessary for hair cell development. These genes
crossregulate each other but are differentially required during distinct
developmental periods, first in the preotic placode and later in the otic
vesicle. Interactions with the Notch pathway confirm that atoh1 genes have early 
proneural function. Fgf3 and Fgf8 are upstream activators of atoh1 genes during
both phases, and foxi1, pax8 and dlx genes regulate atoh1b in the preplacode. A
model is presented in which zebrafish atoh1 genes operate in a complex network
leading to hair cell development.

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells are progenitors in vitro for inner ear hair
cells.

Stem cells have been demonstrated in the inner ear but they do not spontaneously 
divide to replace damaged sensory cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from bone
marrow have been reported to differentiate into multiple lineages including
neurons, and we therefore asked whether MSCs could generate sensory cells.
Overexpression of the prosensory transcription factor, Math1, in sensory
epithelial precursor cells induced expression of myosin VIIa, espin, Brn3c,
p27Kip, and jagged2, indicating differentiation to inner ear sensory cells. Some 
of the cells displayed F-actin positive protrusions in the morphology
characteristic of hair cell stereociliary bundles. Hair cell markers were also
induced by culture of mouse MSC-derived cells in contact with embryonic chick
inner ear cells, and this induction was not due to a cell fusion event, because
the chick hair cells could be identified with a chick-specific antibody and chick
and mouse antigens were never found in the same cell.

In the avian inner ear, nonsensory supporting cells give rise to new sensory hair
cells through two distinct processes: mitosis and direct transdifferentiation.
Regulation of supporting cell behavior and cell fate specification during avian
hair cell regeneration is poorly characterized. Expression of Atoh1, a proneural 
transcription factor necessary and sufficient for developmental hair cell
specification, was examined using immunofluorescence in quiescent and
regenerating hair cell epithelia of mature chickens. In untreated birds, Atoh1
protein was not detected in the auditory epithelium, which is quiescent. In
contrast, numerous Atoh1-positive nuclei were seen in the utricular macula, which
undergoes continual hair cell turnover. Atoh1-positive nuclei emerged in the
auditory epithelium by 15 hr post-ototoxin administration, before overt hair cell
damage and supporting cell re-entry into the cell cycle. Subsequently, Atoh1
labeling was seen in 15% of dividing supporting cells. During cell division,
Atoh1 was distributed symmetrically to daughter cells, but Atoh1 levels were
dramatically regulated shortly thereafter. After cellular differentiation, Atoh1 
labeling was confined to hair cells regenerated through either mitosis or direct 
transdifferentiation. However, Atoh1 expression in dividing progenitors did not
necessarily predict hair cell fate specification in daughter cells. Finally,
predominant modes of hair cell regeneration varied significantly across the
radial axis of the auditory epithelium, with mitosis most frequent neurally and
direct transdifferentiation most frequent abneurally. These observations suggest 
a role for Atoh1 in re-specifying supporting cells and in biasing postmitotic
cells toward the hair cell fate during hair cell regeneration in the mature
chicken ear.

During central nervous system (CNS) development, cell migration precedes and is
key to the integration of diverse sets of cells. Mechanistically, CNS
histogenesis is realized through a balanced interplay of cell-cell and
cell-matrix adhesion molecules. Here, we summarize experiments that probe the
developmental expression and potential significance of a set of cadherins,
including M-, N- and R-cadherin, for patterning of the cerebellar cortex. We
established a transgenic marker that allows cerebellar granule cells to be
followed from the neuroblast stage to their final, postmitotic settlement. In
conjunction with flow cytometry, this allowed us to derive a quantitative view of
cadherin expression in differentiating granule cells and relate it to the
expression of the same cadherins in cerebellar inhibitory interneuronal
precursors. In vitro reaggregation analysis supports a role for cadherins in cell
sorting and migration within the nascent cerebellar cortex that may be
rationalized within the context of the differential adhesion hypothesis (Foty,
R.A. and Steinberg, M.S., 2005. The differential adhesion hypothesis: a direct
evaluation. Dev. Biol. 278, 255-263.).

Neurogenin 3 and the enteroendocrine cell lineage in the adult mouse small
intestinal epithelium.

It is thought that small intestinal epithelial stem cell progeny, via Notch
signaling, yield a Hes1-expressing columnar lineage progenitor and an Atoh1 (also
known as Math1)-expressing common progenitor for all granulocytic lineages
including enteroendocrine cells, one of the body's largest populations of
endocrine cells. Because Neurogenin 3 (Neurog3) null mice lack enteroendocrine
cells, Neurog3-expressing progenitors derived from the common granulocytic
progenitor are thought to produce the enteroendocrine lineage, although more
recent work indicates that Neurog3+ progenitors also contribute to
non-enteroendocrine lineages. We aimed to test this model and better characterize
the progenitors leading from the stem cells to the enteroendocrine lineage. We
investigated clones derived from enteroendocrine precursors and found no evidence
of a common granulocytic progenitor that routinely yields all granulocytic
lineages. Rather, enteroendocrine cells are derived from a short-lived
bipotential progenitor whose offspring, probably via Notch signaling, yield a
Neurog3+ cell committed to the enteroendocrine lineage and a progenitor committed
to the columnar lineage. The Neurog3+ cell population is heterogeneous; only
about 1/3 are slowly cycling progenitors, the rest are postmitotic cells in early
stages of enteroendocrine differentiation. No evidence was found that Neurog3+
cells contribute to non-enteroendocrine lineages. Revised lineage models for the 
small intestinal epithelium are introduced.

HATH1 expression in mucinous cancers of the colorectum and related lesions.

YS.

94121, USA.

PURPOSE: Mucinous cancers and signet ring carcinomas are distinct classes of
colon cancers characterized by their production of copious quantities of
intestinal goblet cell mucin, MUC2. Deletion of transcription factor HATH1
ablates the biogenesis of goblet cells in developing mouse intestine, and forced 
expression of HATH1 results in elevated expression of MUC2 in colon cancer cells.
The aim of this study was to assess the possible role of HATH1 in the development
of mucinous cancers and signet ring carcinomas.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy was used to
examine HATH1 expression and subcellular distribution in normal colon and small
intestine, mucinous cancers, signet ring carcinomas, and nonmucinous cancers and 
in precursor lesions, including hyperplastic polyps, serrated adenomas, tubular
adenomas, and villous adenomas. We also analyzed the transactivation of MUC2
promoter/reporter constructs by a HATH1 expression vector.
RESULTS: HATH1 expression transactivated MUC2 promoter/reporter constructs, an
activity that was significantly inhibited by mutation of putative HATH1-binding
sites. HATH1 was expressed in the nuclei of goblet cells and in the cytoplasm and
nuclei of enteroendocrine cells of the colon. In the small intestine, only
cytoplasmic expression of HATH1 in enteroendocrine cells was detected. HATH1 was 
found to be strongly expressed in the nuclei of hyperplastic polyps, serrated
adenomas, villous adenomas, mucinous cancers, and signet ring carcinomas but
repressed in nonmucinous cancers and tubular adenomas.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the importance of HATH1 for the development of
intestinal secretory cells. The results further suggest that HATH1 is an
important factor in the up-regulation of MUC2 expression that occurs in mucinous 
cancers and signet ring carcinomas. In addition, the expression of HATH1 in
hyperplastic polyps, serrated adenomas, and villous adenomas lends support to the
hypothesis that these neoplasms are frequent precursors in mucinous cancer and
signet ring carcinoma development.

Medicine, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan. mikio@lmls.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp

Although the cerebellum contains a relatively small variety of neurons, the
molecular machinery governing neuronal generation and/or subtype specification is
still poorly understood. We identified a novel mutant mouse, cerebelless, which
lacks the entire cerebellar cortex but survives up to the adult stages. Analyses 
of its phenotypes and identification of its responsible gene clarified that Ptf1a
(pancreas transcription factor 1a), which encodes a bHLH transcription factor, is
involved in cerebellar GABAergic neuron production. Together with recently
published papers describing another bHLH gene, Math1, our study proposes that two
bHLH transcription factors, PTF1A and MATH1, may participate in regionalization
of cerebellar neuroepithelium, defining two distinct areas, the ventricular zone 
and the rhombic lip, which generate GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons,
respectively. Here I will describe a novel cerebellar mutant, cerebelless, review
the role of Ptf1a in GABAergic neuron production, and discuss new insights into
cerebellar development from the vantage point of regulation by bHLH transcription
factors.

cells.

Caudal-related homeobox 2 (Cdx2) has been suggested as an early marker of
Barrett's esophagus (BE), which is the premalignant lesion of esophageal
adenocarcinoma (EAC). However, the mechanism of ectopic Cdx2 expression in the
esophageal epithelial cells and its role in the development of BE remained
unclear. RT-PCR, pyrosequencing and methylation-specific PCR were used to
determine expression and promoter methylation of Cdx2 in human esophageal
epithelial cells (HET1A and SEG1) after treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine
(DAC), acid, bile acids and their combination. HET1A cells with stable
transfection of Cdx2 were characterized for morphology and gene expression
profiles with Affymetrix array. We found Cdx2 was expressed in most human EAC
cell lines, but not in squamous epithelial cell lines. DAC-induced demethylation 
and expression of Cdx2 in HET1A and SEG1 cells, and treatment with a DNA
methylating agent counteracted the effect of DAC. Treatment of HET1A and SEG1
cells with acid, bile acids or both also resulted in promoter demethylation and
expression of Cdx2. HET1A cells with stable transfection of human Cdx2 formed
crypt-like structures in vitro. Microarray analysis and quantitative real-time
PCR showed that stable transfection of Cdx2 up-regulated differentiation markers 
of intestinal columnar epithelial cells and goblet cells in HET1A cells. This may
be partially due to modulation of Notch signaling pathway, as western blotting
confirmed down-regulation of Hes1 and up-regulation of Atoh1 and Muc2. Our data
suggest that exposure to acid and/or bile acids may activate Cdx2 expression in
human esophageal epithelial cells through promoter demethylation, and ectopic
Cdx2 expression in esophageal squamous epithelial cells may contribute to
intestinal metaplasia of the esophagus.

Inducible Cre recombinase activity in mouse cerebellar granule cell precursors

Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.

A transgenic mouse line expressing the CreER(TM) fusion protein under the control
of the Math1 enhancer was generated. Expression of the transgene in the postnatal
mouse was restricted to hair cells of the inner ear and granule neurons in the
external granule layer of the cerebellum in a temporally regulated manner. Cre
activity was virtually nonexistent in uninduced mice; however, treatment of
newborn pups with tamoxifen, leading to nuclear translocation of the fusion
protein, resulted in efficient recombination at LoxP sites in the appropriate
cell types. Up to two thirds of cerebellar granule neurons and 80-90% of cochlear
hair cells underwent Cre-specific recombination. This mouse line provides a
powerful tool to dissect gene function at early and late stages in development of
the cerebellum and inner ear.

The intestine-specific homeobox gene Cdx2 induces expression of the basic
helix-loop-helix transcription factor Math1.

The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Math1, which is transiently
expressed in proliferating neural precursors in multiple domains of the
developing nervous system, is also related to the cell fate decision of
enteroendocrine, goblet, and Paneth cells in the intestine. On the other hand,
the transcription factor Cdx2, which is normally confined to intestinal
epithelial cells, is related to the differentiation of these cells. Therefore, we
investigated the relationship between Math1 and Cdx2 in intestinal epithelial
cells. The Math1 and Cdx2 expressions in normal intestinal mucosa and intestinal 
metaplastic mucosa from mouse and human stomachs, as well as an intestinal
crypt-derived cell line, were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Northern blotting, and Math1 enhancer
element was analyzed by luciferase reporter assays. Math1-positive epithelial
cells co-expressing Cdx2 were found in normal intestinal mucosa from humans and
mice. Furthermore, Math1-producing epithelial cells that showed positive
immunostaining for Cdx2 were also observed in intestinal metaplastic mucosa from 
human and Cdx2 transgenic mouse stomachs, although they were not detected in
normal gastric mucosa of humans and mice. Expression of Cdx2 stimulated
endogenous Math1 mRNA expression in the intestinal crypt-derived cell line IEC-6,
corroborating observations in Cdx2-expressing intestinal metaplastic mucosa.
Furthermore, expression of Cdx2 in IEC-6 cells conferred the ability to express a
Math1 reporter gene containing a Math1 enhancer. Based on these results, we
hypothesize that Cdx2 is involved in activating Math1 expression in intestinal
epithelial cells.

Mapping of notch activation during cochlear development in mice: implications for
determination of prosensory domain and cell fate diversification.

Recent chick experiments have shown that Notch signaling plays context-dependent 
distinct roles in inner ear development: initially, Notch activity confers a
prosensory character on groups of cells by "lateral induction"; subsequently, it 
is involved in the establishment of fine-graded patterns of hair cells and
supporting cells by "lateral inhibition." However, the spatiotemporal pattern of 
Notch activation in situ during mammalian inner ear development has not been
investigated. In this study, we detected the expression patterns of the activated
form of Notch1 (actN1) as well as those of endogenous Notch1, Jagged1 (Jag1), and
Math1. ActN1 was detected by immunohistochemistry using an antibody that
specifically recognizes the processed form of the intracellular domain of Notch1 
cleaved by presenilin/gamma-secretase activity. Between embryonic days (E)12.5
and E14.5, actN1 was weakly detected mainly in the medial region of cochlear
epithelium, where Jag1-immunoreactivivty (IR) was also observed. Jag1-IR
gradually became stronger in a more sharply defined area, finally becoming
localized in supporting cells, while actN1 was detected in an overlapping area.
Thus, a positive feedback loop was assumed to exist between the expression of
Jag1 and actN1. In addition, actN1 started to be strongly expressed in the cells 
surrounding Math1-positive hair cell progenitors between E14.5 and E15.5. Strong 
actN1-IR continued in both a supporting cell lineage and in the greater
epithelial ridge during the perinatal stage but ended by P7, suggesting that
Notch1 activation may initially demarcate a prosensory region in the cochlear
epithelium and then inhibit progenitor cells from becoming hair cells via
classical "lateral inhibition."

Math1 target genes are enriched with evolutionarily conserved clustered E-box
binding sites.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cell and Animal Biology, Institute of Life Sciences, The Hebrew 
University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Math1 and its orthologs
are fundamental for proper development of various neuronal subpopulations, such
as cerebellar granule cells, D1 interneurons in the spinal cord, and inner ear
hair cells. Although crucial for neurogenesis, the mechanisms by which Math1
specifically recognizes its direct targets are not fully understood. To search
for direct and indirect target genes and signaling pathways controlled by Math1, 
we analyzed the effect of Math1 knockout on the expression profile of multiple
genes in the embryonic cerebellum. Eighteen differentially expressed transcripts 
were identified and found to belong to a few developmentally-related functional
groups, such as transcriptional regulation, proliferation, organogenesis, signal 
transduction, and apoptosis. Importantly, genomic analysis of E-box motifs has
identified a significant enrichment and clustering of MATH1-binding E-boxes only 
in a subset of differentially expressed genes (Nr2f6, Hras1, and Hes5) in both
mouse and man. Moreover, Math1 was shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 
to bind, and by a luciferase reporter assay to activate transcription, of an
upstream genomic fragment of Nr2f6. Taken together, we propose that when putative
direct targets of Math1 are being selected for detailed studies on DNA microarray
hybridization, the enrichment and clustering of binding E-boxes in multiple
species may be helpful criteria. Our findings may be useful to the study of other
bHLH transcription factors, many of which control the development of the nervous 
system.

Hath1 up-regulates gastric mucin gene expression in gastric cells.

Japan.

The Notch signaling pathway is known to mediate the differentiation and fate
specification of cells in embryonic stage and adult tissues. Several tumors
exhibit aberrant expression of Notch signaling component genes, such as
Notch1/2/3 and Hath1. In this study, we investigated the mRNA expression of seven
Notch-related genes, Notch1/2/3, Hes1/2/3, and Hath1, and then compared it with
the expression of gastric mucin genes, MUC5AC and MUC6, in eight gastric cancer
(GC) cell lines. Notch1/2/3 and Hes1 were expressed in most GC cell lines as well
as normal gastric mucosae, while Hes2/3 were expressed in neither these cell
lines nor the normal stomach. As for Hath1, five GC cell lines exhibited
undetectable levels, while normal gastric mucosa expressed Hath1. The expression 
patterns of Hath1 and MUC6 were closely related in most GC cell lines. Many
MUC5AC-positive cases also tended to show Hath1 expression. Over-expression of
Math1, a mouse Hath1 homolog, in the GC cells strongly enhanced both the MUC6 and
MUC5AC mRNA levels. Moreover, knockdown of Hath1 by means of RNA interference
significantly decreased the expression of both mucin genes. These data indicate
that Hath1 is one of the transcriptional regulators for MUC6 and MUC5AC in GC
cells. It is also possible that loss of Hath1 expression may play a role in
gastric carcinogenesis.

Stem cell therapy for hearing loss: Math1 overexpression in VOT-E36 cells.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Otolaryngology, Center for Aging, Washington University School
of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.

HYPOTHESIS: VOT-E36 cells acquire mechanosensitivity after mammalian atonal
homolog 1 (Math1) overexpression.
BACKGROUND: VOT-E36 cells are derived from a population of epithelial cells in
the ventral region of the otocyst at embryonic Day 10.5, before hair cell
differentiation. These cells express a number of specific molecular markers for
hair cells under both proliferation and differentiation states. Overexpression of
Math1 can convert nonsensory epithelial cells into hair cells in the cochlea.
Based on this information, we tested whether VOT-E36 cells can be converted into 
hair cells by Math1 overexpression.
METHODS: Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-based analysis, we
first compared the expression patterns of various molecular markers for hair cell
development in VOT-E36 cells between proliferation and differentiation states,
and also before and after overexpression of Math1. Subsequently, with a standard 
calcium imaging method, we examined whether VOT-E36 cells overexpressing Math1
could detect mechanical vibrations and activate spiral ganglion neurons in a
coculture model. In addition, using confocal and scanning electron microscopes,
we examined morphologic changes of VOT-E36 cells after Math1 overexpression.
RESULTS: Consistent with previous reports, this study has shown that VOT-E36
cells express a number of specific molecular markers for hair cells in both
proliferation and differentiation states. Under appropriate culture conditions,
Math1 is transiently expressed in this cell line during conditional
differentiation. In VOT-E36 cells overexpressing Math1, the normal expression
pattern of certain molecular markers for mature hair cells is partially restored.
Interestingly, after coculture with spiral ganglion neurons, VOT-E36 cells
overexpressing Math1 are able to respond to mechanical vibrations and activate
spiral ganglion neurons. Possible molecular mechanisms underlying this novel
finding have been explored.
CONCLUSION: Math1 overexpression can partially restore presumably downstream
signaling cascades for normal hair cell differentiation in VOT-E36 cells, which
are able to detect mechanical vibrations after being cocultured with spiral
ganglion neurons.

Development and evolution of the vestibular sensory apparatus of the mammalian
ear.

Author information: 
(1)Creighton University, Omaha, NE and BTNRH, Omaha, NE 68178, USA.

Herein, we will review molecular aspects of vestibular ear development and
present them in the context of evolutionary changes and hair cell regeneration.
Several genes guide the development of anterior and posterior canals. Although
some of these genes are also important for horizontal canal development, this
canal strongly depends on a single gene, Otx1. Otx1 also governs the segregation 
of saccule and utricle. Several genes are essential for otoconia and cupula
formation, but protein interactions necessary to form and maintain otoconia or a 
cupula are not yet understood. Nerve fiber guidance to specific vestibular
end-organs is predominantly mediated by diffusible neurotrophic factors that work
even in the absence of differentiated hair cells. Neurotrophins, in particular
Bdnf, are the most crucial attractive factor released by hair cells. If Bdnf is
misexpressed, fibers can be redirected away from hair cells. Hair cell
differentiation is mediated by Atoh1. However, Atoh1 may not initiate hair cell
precursor formation. Resolving the role of Atoh1 in postmitotic hair cell
precursors is crucial for future attempts in hair cell regeneration. Additional
analyses are needed before gene therapy can help regenerate hair cells, restore
otoconia, and reconnect sensory epithelia to the brain.

We carried out an analysis of the expression of Prox1, a homeo-domain
transcription factor, during mouse inner ear development with particular emphasis
on the auditory system. Prox1 is expressed in the otocyst beginning at embryonic 
day (E)11, in the developing vestibular sensory patches. Expression is down
regulated in maturing (myosin VIIA immunoreactive) vestibular hair cells and
subsequently in the underlying support cell layer by E16.5. In the auditory
sensory epithelium, Prox1 is initially expressed at embryonic day 14.5 in a
narrow stripe of cells at the base of the cochlea. This stripe encompasses the
full thickness of the sensory epithelium, including developing hair cells and
support cells. Over the next several days the stripe of expression extends to the
apex, and as the sensory epithelium differentiates Prox1 becomes restricted to a 
subset of support cells. Double labeling for Prox1 and cell-type-specific markers
revealed that the outer hair cells transiently express Prox1. After E18, Prox1
protein is no longer detectable in hair cells, but it continues to be expressed
in support cells for the rest of embryogenesis and into the second postnatal
week. During this time, Prox1 is not expressed in all support cell types in the
organ of Corti, but is restricted to developing Deiters' and pillar cells. The
expression is maintained in these cells into the second week of postnatal life,
at which time Prox1 is dynamically down regulated. These studies form a baseline 
from which we can analyze the role of Prox1 in vertebrate sensory development.

Basic helix-loop-helix gene Hes6 delineates the sensory hair cell lineage in the

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cell Biology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta,
Georgia 30322, USA.

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) gene Hes6 is known to promote neural
differentiation in vitro. Here, we report the expression and functional studies
of Hes6 in the inner ear. The expression of Hes6 appears to be parallel to that
of Math1 (also known as Atoh1), a bHLH gene necessary and sufficient for hair
cell differentiation. Hes6 is expressed initially in the presumptive hair cell
precursors in the cochlea. Subsequently, the expression of Hes6 is restricted to 
morphologically differentiated hair cells. Similarly, the expression of Hes6 in
the vestibule is in the hair cell lineage. Hes6 is dispensable for hair cell
differentiation, and its expression in inner ear hair cells is abolished in the
Math1-null animals. Furthermore, the introduction of Hes6 into the cochlea in
vitro is not sufficient to promote sensory or neuronal differentiation.
Therefore, Hes6 is downstream of Math1 and its expression in the inner ear
delineates the sensory lineage. However, the role of Hes6 in the inner ear
remains elusive.

On the basis of the cellular morphological changes in the cartilaginous area, the
mandibular condylar cartilage is histopathologically composed of four different
cell layers--fibrous, proliferative, maturative, and hypertrophic. Reaction for
Notch1 was present in the hypertrophic cells only. However, Math1 was locally
distributed in the hypertrophic layer and partially in the proliferative layer.
The expression patterns of Notch1 and Math1 were slightly different. These
results suggest that the morphogenesis regulation factors of Notch1 and Math1 may
play some role in mandibular condylar cartilage. Positive reactions to
osteopontin, as a control, were detected in the cytoplasm of all layers, although
they varied from published data.

Inhibitors of differentiation and DNA binding (Ids) regulate Math1 and hair cell

(1)Section on Developmental Neuroscience, Porter Neuroscience Center, National
Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Math1 (also called Atoh1) 
is both necessary and sufficient for hair cell development in the mammalian
cochlea (Bermingham et al., 1999; Zheng and Gao, 2000). Previous studies have
demonstrated that a dynamic pattern of Math1 expression plays a key role in
regulating the number and position of mechanosensory hair cells. However, the
factors that regulate the temporal and spatial expression of Math1 within the
cochlea are unknown. The bHLH-related inhibitors of differentiation and DNA
binding (Id) proteins are known to negatively regulate many bHLH transcription
factors, including Math1, in a number of different systems. Therefore, Id
proteins are good candidates for regulating Math1 in the cochlea. Results from
PCR and in situ hybridization indicate that Id1, Id2, and Id3 are expressed
within the cochlear duct in a pattern that is consistent with a role in
regulation of hair cell development. In particular, expression of Ids and Math1
overlapped in cochlear progenitor cells before cellular differentiation, but a
specific downregulation of Id expression was observed in individual cells that
differentiated as hair cells. In addition, progenitor cells in which the
expression of Ids was maintained during the time period for hair cell
differentiation were inhibited from developing as hair cells. These results
indicate a key role for Ids in the regulation of expression of Math1 and hair
cell differentiation in the developing cochlea.

A role for Hath1, a bHLH transcription factor, in colon adenocarcinoma.

Leow CC(1), Polakis P, Gao WQ.

(1)Department of Molecular Biology, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA
94080, USA. ching2@gene.com

A significant reduction or loss of goblet cells is often observed in clinical
samples of colon adenocarcinomas, which is the predominant form of colon
carcinoma. Mice lacking Math1, a bHLH transcription factor downstream of the
Notch signaling pathway, demonstrates that Math1 is necessary for cell fate
determination of the intestinal secretory cells, including goblet cells.
Examination of Hath1, the human orthologue of Math1, expression in multiple colon
tumor samples and colon cancer cell lines reveals a dramatic decrease in Hath1
expression in colon tumor samples and colon cancer cell lines. Hath1 expression
in the HT29 colon cancer cell line can significantly inhibit its proliferation
and anchorage-independent growth both in vitro and in vivo. At the molecular
level, Hath1 may regulate the expression of MUC2, a mucin secreted by goblet
cells, and Hath1 may also be a novel factor normally repressed as a consequence
of activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which has been clearly implicated in 
colon tumorigenesis.

Hindbrain rhombic lip is comprised of discrete progenitor cell populations
allocated by Pax6.

USA.

The lower rhombic lip (LRL) is a germinal zone in the dorsal hindbrain productive
of tangentially migrating neurons, streaming extramurally (mossy fiber neurons)
or intramurally (climbing fiber neurons). Here we show that LRL territory,
operationally defined by Wnt1 expression, is parceled into molecular subdomains
predictive of cell fate. Progressing dorsoventrally, Lmx1a and Gdf7 expression
identifies the primordium for hindbrain choroid plexus epithelial cells; Math1,
for mossy fiber neurons; and immediately ventral to Math1 yet within Wnt1(+)
territory, a climbing fiber primordium dominated by Ngn1-expressing cells.
Elimination of Pax6 results in expansion of this Ngn1(+) progenitor pool and
reduction in the Math1(+) pool, with accompanying later enlargement of the
climbing fiber nucleus and reductions in mossy fiber nuclei. Pax6 loss also
disrupts Msx expression cell-nonautonomously, suggesting Pax6 may influence LRL
progenitor identity indirectly through potentiating BMP signaling. These studies 
suggest that underlying the diversity and proportions of fates produced by the
LRL is a precise suborganization regulated by Pax6.

A novel role for the choroid plexus in BMP-mediated inhibition of differentiation
of cerebellar neural progenitors.

(1)Department of Cell and Animal Biology, Institute of Life Sciences, Hebrew
University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 91904, Israel.

Cerebellar granule cells, the most abundant neurons in the mammalian brain, arise
in the rhombic lip located at the roof of the brain's fourth ventricle. Bordering
the rhombic lip is the choroid plexus, a non-neuronal structure, composed of
blood vessels enveloped by epithelial cells. Here, we show a striking decrease in
neural differentiation of rhombic lip-derived cells, which failed to extend
neuritic processes and attenuate Math1 promoter activity, when co-cultured with
choroid plexus cells. Moreover, a blocking antibody against BMP7, a morphogenetic
protein expressed in the choroid plexus, blocked the inhibitory effect of the
choroid plexus, whereas purified BMP7 mimicked this effect, demonstrating causal 
involvement of BMP. On the other hand, the BMP antagonist NBL1 promoted
neurogenesis in rhombic lip cultures from Math1 null mice displaying arrested
differentiation. Our data indicate that besides its secretory and barrier
functions, the choroid plexus has a novel role in attenuating the differentiation
of adjacent neural progenitors.

Inhibition of Notch/RBP-J signaling induces hair cell formation in neonate mouse 
cochleas.

Mammalian inner ear hair cells in cochleas are believed to be incapable of
regeneration after birth, which hampers treatment of sensorineural hearing
impairment mainly caused by hair cell loss. Sensory epithelia of cochleas are
composed of hair cells and supporting cells, both of which originate from common 
progenitors. Notch/RBP-J signaling is an evolutionally conserved pathway involved
in specification of various cell types in developmental stage and even in some of
postnatal mammalian organs. The specification of hair cell fate from the
progenitors is inhibited by Notch/RBP-J signaling in embryonic inner ears.
However, its function in postnatal inner ears is unknown. We showed that
inhibition of Notch/RBP-J signaling, by either conditional disruption of the
Rbpsuh gene or treatment with a gamma-secretase inhibitor, could give rise to
ectopic hair cells in the supporting cell region in organs of Corti from neonatal
mouse cochleas where hair cells have not been considered to regenerate after
birth. We also showed that down-regulation of Hes5 and up-regulation of Math1
were associated with ectopic hair cell induction. These results suggest that
Notch/RBP-J signaling inhibits supporting cells from differentiation into hair
cells even in postnatal days, implying that inhibitors of Notch/RBP-J signaling
can be used to help regenerating hair cells after birth and thus serve for
potential treatment of intractable sensorineural hearing impairment caused by
hair cell loss without genetical manipulation.

The related retinoblastoma (pRb) and p130 proteins cooperate to regulate
homeostasis in the intestinal epithelium.

USA.

pRb, p107, and p130 are related proteins that play a central role in the
regulation of cell cycle progression and terminal differentiation in mammalian
cells. Nevertheless, it is still largely unclear how these proteins achieve this 
regulation in vivo. The intestinal epithelium is an ideal in vivo system in which
to study the molecular pathways that regulate proliferation and differentiation
because it exists in a constant state of development throughout an animal's
lifetime. We studied the phenotypic effects on the intestinal epithelium of
mutating Rb and p107 or p130. Although mutating these genes singly had little or 
no effect, loss of pRb and p107 or p130 together produced chronic hyperplasia and
dysplasia of the small intestinal and colonic epithelium. In Rb/p130 double
mutants this hyperplasia was associated with defects in terminal differentiation 
of specific cell types and was dependent on the increased proliferation seen in
the epithelium of mutant animals. At the molecular level, dysregulation of the Rb
pathway led to an increase in the expression of Math1, Cdx1, Cdx2, transcription 
factors that regulate proliferation and differentiation in the intestinal
epithelium. The absence of Cdx1 function in Rb/p130 double mutant mice partially 
reverted the histologic phenotype by suppressing ectopic mitosis in the
epithelium. These studies implicate the Rb pathway as a regulator of epithelial
homeostasis in the intestine.

Gfi1 functions downstream of Math1 to control intestinal secretory cell subtype

Gfi1 is a transcriptional repressor implicated in lymphomagenesis, neutropenia,
and hematopoietic development, as well as ear and lung development. Here, we
demonstrate that Gfi1 functions downstream of Math1 in intestinal secretory
lineage differentiation. Gfi1(-/-) mice lack Paneth cells, have fewer goblet
cells, and supernumerary enteroendocrine cells. Gfi1(-/-) mice show gene
expression changes consistent with this altered cell allocation. These data
suggest that Gfi1 functions to select goblet/Paneth versus enteroendocrine
progenitors. We propose a model of intestinal cell fate choice in which
beta-catenin and Cdx function upstream of Math1, and lineage-specific genes such 
as Ngn3 act downstream of Gfi1.

The transmembrane semaphorin protein Sema6A is broadly expressed in the
developing nervous system. Sema6A repels several classes of developing axons in
vitro and contributes to thalamocortical axon guidance in vivo. Here we show that
during cerebellum development, Sema6A is selectively expressed by postmitotic
granule cells during their tangential migration in the deep external granule cell
layer, but not during their radial migration. In Sema6A-deficient mice, many
granule cells remain ectopic in the molecular layer where they differentiate and 
are contacted by mossy fibers. The analysis of ectopic granule cell morphology in
Sema6a-/- mice, and of granule cell migration and neurite outgrowth in cerebellar
explants, suggests that Sema6A controls the initiation of granule cell radial
migration, probably through a modulation of nuclear and/or soma translocation.
Finally, the analysis of mouse chimeras suggests that this function of Sema6A is 
primarily non-cell-autonomous.

Math1 expression redefines the rhombic lip derivatives and reveals novel lineages

Comment in
    Neuron. 2005 Oct 6;48(1):1-4.

The rhombic lip (RL) is an embryonic proliferative neuroepithelium that generates
several groups of hindbrain neurons. However, the precise boundaries and
derivatives of the RL have never been genetically identified. We use
beta-galactosidase expressed from the Math1 locus in Math1-heterozygous and
Math1-null mice to track RL-derived cells and to evaluate their developmental
requirements for Math1. We uncover a Math1-dependent rostral rhombic-lip
migratory stream (RLS) that generates some neurons of the parabrachial, lateral
lemniscal, and deep cerebellar nuclei, in addition to cerebellar granule neurons.
A more caudal Math1-dependent cochlear extramural stream (CES) generates the
ventral cochlear nucleus and cochlear granule neurons. Similarly, mossy-fiber
precerebellar nuclei require Math1, whereas the inferior olive and locus
coeruleus do not. We propose that Math1 expression delimits the extent of the
rhombic lip and is required for the generation of the hindbrain superficial
migratory streams, all of which contribute neurons to the
proprioceptive/vestibular/auditory sensory network.

We have utilized an in vivo-inducible genetic-fate-mapping strategy to
permanently label cohorts of Math1-positive cells and their progeny that arise in
the rhombic lip of the cerebellar primordium during embryogenesis. At stages
prior to E12.5, with the exception of the deep cerebellar nuclei, we find that
Math1 cells migrate out of the cerebellar primordium into the rostral hindbrain
to populate specific nuclei that include cholinergic neurons of the mesopontine
tegmental system. Moreover, analysis of Math1-null embryos shows that this gene
is required for the formation of some of these nuclei. Around E12.5, granule cell
precursors begin to be labeled: first, ones that give rise to granule cells that 
predominantly populate the anterior lobes of the adult cerebellum and later,
those that populate progressing more caudally lobes until labeling of all granule
cell precursors is complete by E17. Thus, we demonstrate that the cerebellar
rhombic lip gives rise to multiple cell types within rhombomere 1.

The existence of stem cells in the adult nervous system is well recognized;
however, the potential of these cells is still widely debated. We demonstrate
that neural stem cells exist within the embryonic and adult cerebellum. Comparing
the potential of neural stem cells derived from the forebrain and cerebellum, we 
find that progeny derived from each of these brain regions retain regional
character in vitro as well as after homotopic transplantation. However, when
ectopically transplanted, neurosphere-derived cells from either region are
largely unable to generate neurons. With regard specifically to embryonic and
adult cerebellar stem cells, we observe that they are able to give rise to
neurons that resemble different select classes of cerebellar subclasses when
grafted into the perinatal host cerebellum. Most notably, upon transplantation to
the perinatal cerebellum, cerebellar stem cells from all ages are able to acquire
the position and mature electrophysiological properties of cerebellar granule
cells.

Smaller inner ear sensory epithelia in Neurog 1 null mice are related to earlier

We investigated whether co-expression of Neurog 1 and Atoh 1 in common
neurosensory precursors could explain the loss of hair cells in Neurog 1 null
mice. Analysis of terminal mitosis, using BrdU, supports previous findings
regarding timing of exit from cell cycle. Specifically, we show that cell cycle
exit occurs in spiral sensory neurons in a base-to-apex progression followed by
cell cycle exit of hair cells in the organ of Corti in an apex-to-base
progression, with some overlap of cell cycle exit in the apex for both hair cells
and spiral sensory neurons. Hair cells in Neurog 1 null mice show cell cycle exit
in an apex-to-base progression about 1-2 days earlier. Atoh 1 is expressed in an 
apex-to-base progression rather then a base-to-apex progression as in wildtype
littermates. We tested the possible expression of Atoh1 in neurosensory
precursors using two Atoh 1-Cre lines. We show Atoh 1-Cre mediated
beta-galactosidase expression in delaminating sensory neuron precursors as well
as undifferentiated epithelial cells at E11 and E12.5. PCR analysis shows
expression of Atoh 1 in the otocyst as early as E10.5, prior to any
histology-based detection techniques. Combined, these data suggest that low
levels of Atoh 1 exist much earlier in precursors of hair cells and sensory
neurons, possibly including neurosensory precursors. Analysis of Atoh 1-Cre
expression in E18.5 embryos and P31 mice reveal beta-galactosidase stain in all
hair cells but also in vestibular and cochlear sensory neurons and some
supporting cells. A similar expression of Atoh 1-LacZ exists in postnatal and
adult vestibular and cochlear sensory neurons, and Atoh 1 expression in
vestibular sensory neurons is confirmed with RT-PCR. We propose that the absence 
of NEUROG 1 protein leads to loss of sensory neuron formation through a
phenotypic switch of cycling neurosensory precursors from sensory neuron to hair 
cell fate. Neurog 1 null mice show a truncation of clonal expansion of hair cell 
precursors through temporally altered terminal mitosis, thereby resulting in
smaller sensory epithelia.

The Notch signalling pathway plays a crucial role in specifying cellular fates in
metazoan development by regulating communication between adjacent cells.
Correlative studies suggested an involvement of Notch in intestinal development. 
Here, by modulating Notch activity in the mouse intestine, we directly implicate 
Notch signals in intestinal cell lineage specification. We also show that Notch
activation is capable of amplifying the intestinal progenitor pool while
inhibiting cell differentiation. We conclude that Notch activity is required for 
the maintenance of proliferating crypt cells in the intestinal epithelium.

The cerebellum is critical for motor coordination and cognitive function and is
the target of transformation in medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain 
tumor in children. Although the development of granule cells, the most abundant
neurons in the cerebellum, has been studied in detail, the origins of other
cerebellar neurons and glia remain poorly understood. Here we show that the
murine postnatal cerebellum contains multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs). These 
cells can be prospectively isolated based on their expression of the NSC marker
prominin-1 (CD133) and their lack of markers of neuronal and glial lineages
(lin-). Purified prominin+ lin- cells form self-renewing neurospheres and can
differentiate into astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons in vitro. Moreover,
they can generate each of these lineages after transplantation into the
cerebellum. Identification of cerebellar stem cells has important implications
for the understanding of cerebellar development and the origins of
medulloblastoma.

Otx2 regulates subtype specification and neurogenesis in the midbrain.

Médicale, Université Louis Pasteur, 67404 Illkirch cedex, Strasbourg, France.

The transcription factor Otx2 is required to determine mesencephalic versus
metencephalic (cerebellum/pons) territory during embryogenesis. This function of 
Otx2 primarily involves positioning and maintaining the mid-hindbrain organizer
at the border between midbrain and anterior hindbrain. Otx2 expression is
maintained long after this organizer is established. We therefore generated
conditional mutants of Otx2 using the Cre/loxP system to study later roles during
rostral brain development. For inactivation of Otx2 in neuronal progenitor cells,
we crossed Otx2(flox/flox) animals with Nestin-Cre transgenic animals. In
Nestin-Cre/+; Otx2(flox/flox) embryos, Otx2 activity was lost from the ventral
midbrain starting at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). In these mutant embryos, the
mid-hindbrain organizer was properly positioned at E12.5, although Otx2 is absent
from the midbrain. Hence, the Nestin-Cre/+; Otx2(flox/flox) animals represent a
novel mouse model for studying the role of Otx2 in the midbrain, independently of
abnormal development of the mid-hindbrain organizer. Our data demonstrate that
Otx2 controls the development of several neuronal populations in the midbrain by 
regulating progenitor identity and neurogenesis. Dorsal midbrain progenitors
ectopically expressed Math1 and generate an ectopic cerebellar-like structure.
Similarly, Nkx2.2 ectopic expression ventrally into tegmentum progenitors is
responsible for the formation of serotonergic neurons and hypoplasia of the red
nucleus in the midbrain. In addition, we discovered a novel role for Otx2 in
regulating neurogenesis of dopaminergic neurons. Altogether, these results
demonstrate that Otx2 is required from E10.5 onward to regulate neuronal subtype 
identity and neurogenesis in the midbrain.

Recent findings indicate that the chemokine receptor Cxcr4 is essential for
normal development of the cerebellar cortex. As medulloblastomas (MBs), the most 
common malignant brain tumors of childhood, are believed to arise from neuronal
cerebellar precursors, we asked whether there is a potential role for Cxcr4 in
the pathogenesis of MB. RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry revealed expression of
Cxcr4 in different variants of MBs. Whereas 18/20 classic MBs showed very low
levels of CXCR4 mRNA, high amounts were expressed in 17/18 desmoplastic and 6/7
extensively nodular MBs. In addition, a significant correlation of high CXCR4
mRNA levels and presence of the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR or expression of
ATOH1 and GLI1 suggests that CXCR4 is a reliable marker for tumors derived from
the cerebellar external granular layer. Because Cxcr4 is important for migration 
and cell cycle control of granular precursors, we screened for mutations in the
coding region by SSCP and gene sequencing. In a series of 90 MBs and 8 MB cell
lines, we found one germline and one somatic mutation resulting in amino acid
substitutions in the first (Ile53Leu) and second (Asp97Asn) transmembrane
regions, respectively. These data suggest that Cxcr4 may be involved in the
pathogenesis of MBs.

Sensory hair cells and their associated non-sensory supporting cells in the inner
ear are fundamental for hearing and balance. They arise from a common progenitor,
but little is known about the molecular events specifying this cell lineage. We
recently identified two allelic mouse mutants, light coat and circling (Lcc) and 
yellow submarine (Ysb), that show hearing and balance impairment. Lcc/Lcc mice
are completely deaf, whereas Ysb/Ysb mice are severely hearing impaired. We
report here that inner ears of Lcc/Lcc mice fail to establish a prosensory domain
and neither hair cells nor supporting cells differentiate, resulting in a severe 
inner ear malformation, whereas the sensory epithelium of Ysb/Ysb mice shows
abnormal development with disorganized and fewer hair cells. These phenotypes are
due to the absence (in Lcc mutants) or reduced expression (in Ysb mutants) of the
transcription factor SOX2, specifically within the developing inner ear. SOX2
continues to be expressed in the inner ears of mice lacking Math1 (also known as 
Atoh1 and HATH1), a gene essential for hair cell differentiation, whereas Math1
expression is absent in Lcc mutants, suggesting that Sox2 acts upstream of Math1.

Inner ear hair cells have been suggested as attractors for growing afferent
fibers, possibly through the release of the neurotrophin brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Atoh1 null mice never fully differentiate hair cells 
and supporting cells and, therefore, may show aberrations in the growth and/or
retention of their innervation. We investigated the distribution of cells
positive for Atoh1- or Bdnf-mediated beta-galactosidase expression in Atoh1 null 
and Atoh1 heterozygotic mice and correlated the distribution of these cells with 
their innervation. Embryonic day (E) 18.5 Atoh1 null and heterozygotic
littermates show Atoh1- and BDNF-beta-galactosidase-positive cells in comparable 
distributions in the canal cristae and the cochlea apex.
Atoh1-beta-galactosidase-positive but only occasional
Bdnf-beta-galactosidase-positive cells are found in the utricle, saccule, and
cochlea base of Atoh1 null mutant mice. Absence of Bdnf-beta-galactosidase
expression in the utricle and saccule of Atoh1 null mice is first noted at E12.5,
a time when Atoh1-beta-galactosidase expression is also first detected in these
epithelia. These data suggest that expression of Bdnf is dependent on ATOH1
protein in some but does not require ATOH1 protein in other inner ear cells.
Overall, the undifferentiated Atoh1- and Bdnf-beta-galactosidase-positive cells
show a distribution reminiscent of that in the six sensory epithelia in control
mice, suggesting that ear patterning processes can form discrete patches of Atoh1
and Bdnf expression in the absence of ATOH1 protein. The almost normal growth of 
afferent and efferent fibers in younger embryos suggests that neither fully
differentiated hair cells nor BDNF are necessary for the initial targeted growth 
of fibers. E18.5 Atoh1 null mice have many afferent fibers to the apex of the
cochlea, the anterior and the posterior crista, all areas with numerous
Bdnf-beta-galactosidase-positive cells. Few fibers remain to the saccule,
utricle, and the base of the cochlea, all areas with few or no
Bdnf-beta-galactosidase-positive cells. Thus, retention of fibers is possible
with BDNF, even in the absence of differentiated hair cells.

Proneural basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins are key regulators of
neurogenesis. However, downstream target genes of the bHLH proteins remain poorly
defined. Mbh1 confers commissural neuron identity in the spinal cord. Enhancer
analysis using transgenic mice revealed that Mbh1 expression required an E-box 3'
of the Mbh1 gene. Mbh1 expression was lost in Math1 knockout mice, whereas
misexpression of Math1 induced ectopic expression of Mbh1. Moreover, Math1 bound 
the Mbh1 enhancer containing the E-box in vivo and activated gene expression.
Generation of commissural neurons by Math1 was inhibited by a dominant negative
form of Mbh1. These findings indicate that Mbh1 is necessary and sufficient for
the specification of commissural neurons, as a direct downstream target of Math1.

In the mammalian auditory system, sensory cell loss resulting from aging,
ototoxic drugs, infections, overstimulation and other causes is irreversible and 
leads to permanent sensorineural hearing loss. To restore hearing, it is
necessary to generate new functional hair cells. One potential way to regenerate 
hair cells is to induce a phenotypic transdifferentiation of nonsensory cells
that remain in the deaf cochlea. Here we report that Atoh1, a gene also known as 
Math1 encoding a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor and key regulator of
hair cell development, induces regeneration of hair cells and substantially
improves hearing thresholds in the mature deaf inner ear after delivery to
nonsensory cells through adenovectors. This is the first demonstration of
cellular and functional repair in the organ of Corti of a mature deaf mammal. The
data suggest a new therapeutic approach based on expressing crucial developmental
genes for cellular and functional restoration in the damaged auditory epithelium 
and other sensory systems.

Research Center, Building 35, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.

The transcription factor Math1 (encoded by the gene Atoh1, also called Math1) is 
required for the formation of mechanosensory hair cells in the inner ear;
however, its specific molecular role is unknown. Here we show that absence of
Math1 in mice results in a complete disruption of formation of the sensory
epithelium of the cochlea, including the development of both hair cells and
associated supporting cells. In addition, ectopic expression of Math1 in
nonsensory regions of the cochlea is sufficient to induce the formation of
sensory clusters that contain both hair cells and supporting cells. The formation
of these clusters is dependent on inhibitory interactions mediated, most
probably, through the Notch pathway, and on inductive interactions that recruit
cells to develop as supporting cells through a pathway independent of Math1.
These results show that Math1 functions in the developing cochlea to initiate
both inductive and inhibitory signals that regulate the overall formation of the 
sensory epithelia.

We have generated a mouse model system with a high incidence of medulloblastoma, 
a malignant neoplasm believed to arise from immature precursors of cerebellar
granule neurons. These animals ectopically express interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)
in astrocytes in the CNS in a controlled manner, exploiting the
tetracycline-controllable system. More than 80% of these mice display severe
ataxia and develop cerebellar tumors that express synaptophysin, the mouse atonal
homolog MATH1, sonic hedgehog (SHH), and Gli1. IFN-gamma-induced tumorigenesis in
these mice is associated with increased expression of SHH, and SHH induction and 
tumorigenesis are dependent on signal transducer and activator of transcription 1
(STAT1). When IFN-gamma expression is shut down with doxycycline at postnatal day
12 (P12), the clinical symptoms dissipate and the mice do not develop tumors,
whereas if transgene expression is shut down at P16, the clinical symptoms and
tumors progress to lethality, indicating that IFN-gamma is required for tumor
induction but not progression. The tumors that occur in the continued presence of
IFN-gamma display extensive necrosis and apoptosis as well as macrophage and
lymphocytic infiltration, whereas the tumors that develop in mice in which
IFN-gamma expression is shut down at P16 do not. Thus, IFN-gamma expression in
the perinatal period can induce SHH expression and medulloblastoma in the
cerebellum by a STAT1-dependent mechanism, and its continued presence appears to 
promote a host response to the tumor.

Transcription factors of the bHLH class play crucial roles in neurogenesis by
controlling the location and timing of neuronal commitment and differentiation,
as well as influencing neuronal identity. Proneural bHLH factors belong to the
Olig, Neurogenin, NeuroD, Achaete-scute and Atonal subfamilies, and are expressed
in partially overlapping or complementary patterns within the vertebrate
embryonic neural tube. The combinatorial expression of these factors likely
drives the generic and cell type-specific properties of neurogenesis throughout
the nervous system. As an approach towards identifying a complete set of
vertebrate proneural factors, we report here the isolation of two new zebrafish
neural bHLH gene members, atoh1.2 and beta3.1. Among other sites, both are
expressed in the late embryonic and early larval anterior hindbrain. In this
territory we demonstrate that atoh1.2 and beta3.1 are transcribed in distinct
precursors, further highlighting the subdivision of anterior zebrafish hindbrain 
into subdomains of bHLH expression.

Biological therapy for the inner ear has the potential to revolutionise the
treatment of sensorineural hearing loss, the most common form of deafness.
Progress in the molecular understanding of hearing and hearing loss, combined
with advances in the fields of both gene and cellular therapy for the inner ear, 
is providing a robust foundation from which clinical translation is plausible.
Potential areas of interest in gene therapy and its preclinical application to
deafness are reviewed, and experimental progress that has occurred in cellular

different medulloblastoma sub-types.

Neuro-Oncology and Gene Therapy, via Celoria 11, 20133 Milano, Italy.

In order to look for genetic markers helpful for the biological risk
stratification of medulloblastomas (MBs) we assayed by real-time PCR expression
levels of the following genes: MATH1, encoding a critical transcription factor
for the differentiation of cerebellar granular cells (CGCs); PEDF, that encodes a
trophic factor for CGCs and is located in a region of frequent allelic imbalance 
in MBs; and BIRC5, encoding the antiapoptotic protein survivin, usually
overexpressed in malignancies. Expression levels of TRKC, higher in MBs with a
more favorable prognosis, were also studied. Twenty-three patients were
considered: MATH1 expression was strong in 14/23 and undetectable in the others. 
PEDF was up-regulated in 8/23, TRKC in 9/23, and BIRC5 in 23/23. MATH1 expression
was significantly correlated with adult age (p < 0.0001), tumor location in
hemispheres rather than the vermis (p < 0.0004), and PEDF and TRKC up-regulation 
(p < 0.008 and p < 0.04, respectively). During development MATH1 is selectively
expressed in the external germinal layer (EGL) of the cerebellum. Thus, MATH1
expression identifies a subgroup of MBs that derive from the EGL and arise during
adult age into cerebellar hemispheres. MATH1 mRNA-positive MBs express high
levels of PEDF and show a trend towards longer survival, in agreement with
increased expression of TRKC. BIRC5 expression, which is strong in all MBs and
absent in normal cerebellum, lacks any prognostic value but could be explored for
selective targeting of therapeutic factors to MBs.

Signaling through BMP type 1 receptors is required for development of interneuron
cell types in the dorsal spinal cord.

Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

During spinal cord development, distinct classes of interneurons arise at
stereotypical locations along the dorsoventral axis. In this paper, we
demonstrate that signaling through bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type 1
receptors is required for the formation of two populations of commissural
neurons, DI1 and DI2, that arise within the dorsal neural tube. We have generated
a double knockout of both BMP type 1 receptors, Bmpr1a and Bmpr1b, in the neural 
tube. These double knockout mice demonstrate a complete loss of D1 progenitor
cells, as evidenced by loss of Math1 expression, and the subsequent failure to
form differentiated DI1 interneurons. Furthermore, the DI2 interneuron population
is profoundly reduced. The loss of these populations of cells results in a dorsal
shift of the dorsal cell populations, DI3 and DI4. Other dorsal interneuron
populations, DI5 and DI6, and ventral neurons appear unaffected by the loss of
BMP signaling. The Bmpr double knockout animals demonstrate a reduction in the
expression of Wnt and Id family members, suggesting that BMP signaling regulates 
expression of these factors in spinal cord development. These results provide
genetic evidence that BMP signaling is crucial for the development of dorsal
neuronal cell types.

Hath1, down-regulated in colon adenocarcinomas, inhibits proliferation and
tumorigenesis of colon cancer cells.

California 94080, USA.

A striking feature of colon tumors is the significant reduction of goblet cells. 
Although targeted deletion of Math1 in mice leads to a loss of intestinal
secretory cells, including goblet cells, the role of Hath1 in colon tumorigenesis
remains unknown. Here we report that Hath1, the human ortholog of Math1, was
dramatically down-regulated in colon tumor samples and colon cancer cell lines.
Overexpression of Hath1 in HT29, an aggressive colon cancer cell line, resulted
in a significant inhibition on cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth
in soft agar and, more importantly, growth of human colon cancer cell xenografts 
in athymic nude mice. Such inhibition was accompanied by altered expression of a 
goblet cell differentiation marker, MUC2, and cell cycle regulators cyclin D1 and
p27kip1. Hath1 expression also was up-regulated on inhibition of the Wnt pathway,
which has been well implicated in colon tumorigenesis. Hence, this study suggests
that Hath1 may be a novel factor downstream of the Wnt pathway capable of
suppressing anchorage-independent growth of colon cancer cell lines. More
importantly, this study is the first to establish a link between down-regulation 
of Hath1 expression and colon tumorigenesis.

In vitro growth and differentiation of mammalian sensory hair cell progenitors: a

(1)Gonda Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, House Ear Institute, Los
Angeles, CA 90057, USA.

The sensory hair cells and supporting cells of the organ of Corti are generated
by a precise program of coordinated cell division and differentiation. Since no
regeneration occurs in the mature organ of Corti, loss of hair cells leads to
deafness. To investigate the molecular basis of hair cell differentiation and
their lack of regeneration, we have established a dissociated cell culture system
in which sensory hair cells and supporting cells can be generated from mitotic
precursors. By incorporating a Math1-GFP transgene expressed exclusively in hair 
cells, we have used this system to characterize the conditions required for the
growth and differentiation of hair cells in culture. These conditions include a
requirement for epidermal growth factor, as well as the presence of periotic
mesenchymal cells. Lastly, we show that early postnatal cochlear tissue also
contains cells that can divide and generate new sensory hair cells in vitro.

Hyperactive Wnt signaling changes the developmental potential of embryonic lung
endoderm.

Okubo T(1), Hogan BL.

Author information:

USA. t.okubo@cellbio.duke.edu

BACKGROUND: Studies in many model systems have shown that canonical signaling
through the pathway downstream of ligands of the Wnt family can regulate multiple
steps in organogenesis, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and
lineage specification. In addition, misexpression of the Wnt-family member
Wingless in Drosophila imaginal disc cells can lead to transdetermination of
progenitors from one lineage to another. Conditional deletion of the beta-catenin
component of the Wnt signaling pathway has indicated a role for Wnt signaling in 
mouse lung endoderm development. The full range of effects of this pathway, which
includes the transcription factor Lef1, has not been explored, however.
RESULTS: To explore this issue, we expressed a constitutively active
beta-catenin-Lef1 fusion protein in transgenic embryos using a
lung-endoderm-specific promoter from the surfactant protein C gene. Transgenic
lungs appeared grossly normal, but internally they contained highly
proliferative, cuboidal epithelium lacking fully differentiated lung cell types. 
Unexpectedly, microarray analysis and in situ hybridization revealed a mosaic of 
cells expressing marker genes characteristic of intestinal Paneth and goblet
cells and other non-lung secretory cell types. In addition, there was strong
ectopic expression of genes such as Cdx1 and Atoh1 that normally regulate gut
development and early allocation of cells to intestinal secretory lineages.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that hyperactive Wnt signaling in lung progenitors 
expressing a lung-specific gene can induce a dramatic switch in lineage
commitment and the generation of intestinal cell types. We discuss the relevance 
of our findings to the poorly understood pathological condition of intestinal
metaplasia in humans.

Genotype identification of Math1/LacZ knockout mice based on real-time PCR with
SYBR Green I dye.

Knockout mice are widely used in all fields of biomedical research. Determining
the genotype of every newborn mouse is a tedious task, usually performed by
Southern blot hybridization or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). We describe here 
a quick and simple genotype identification assay based on real-time PCR and SYBR 
Green I dye, without using fluorescent primers. The discrimination between the
wild type and targeted alleles is based on a PCR design that leads to a different
melting temperature for each product. The identification of the genotype is
obvious immediately after amplification, and no post-PCR manipulations are
needed, reducing cost and time. Therefore, while the real-time PCR amplification 
increases the sensitivity, the fact that the reactions tubes are never opened
after amplification, reduces the risk of contamination and eliminates errors,
which are common during the repeated handling of dozens of samples from the same 
mouse line. The protocol we provide was tested on Math1 knockout mice, but is
general, and may be utilized for any knockout line and real-time thermocycler,
without any further modification, accessories or special reagents.

Strategies for replacing lost cochlear hair cells.

MSRB III Room-9303, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0648, USA.

The auditory sensory epithelium is a mosaic composed of sensory (hair) cells and 
several types of non-sensory (supporting) cells. All these cells are highly
differentiated in their structure and function. Mosaic epithelia (and other
complex tissues) are generally formed by differentiation of distinct and
specialized cell types from common progenitors. Most types of epithelial tissues 
maintain a population of undifferentiated (basal) cells which facilitate turnover
(renewal) and repair, but this is not the case for the organ of Corti in the
cochlea. Therefore, when cochlear hair cells are lost they cannot be replaced.
Consequently, sensorineural hearing loss is permanent. In designing therapy for
sensorineural deafness, the most important task is to find a way to generate new 
cochlear hair cells to replace lost cells.

Growing evidence indicates that cell cycle arrest and neurogenesis are highly
coordinated and interactive processes, governed by cell cycle genes and neural
transcription factors. The gene PC3 (Tis21/BTG2) is expressed in the neuroblast
throughout the neural tube and inhibits cell cycle progression at the G1
checkpoint by repressing cyclin D1 transcription. We generated inducible mouse
models in which the expression of PC3 was upregulated in neuronal precursors of
the neural tube and of the cerebellum. These mice exhibited a marked increase in 
the production of postmitotic neurons and impairment of cerebellar development.
Cerebellar granule precursors of PC3 transgenic mice displayed inhibition of
cyclin D1 expression and a strong increase in the expression of Math1, a
transcription factor required for their differentiation. Furthermore, PC3,
encoded by a recombinant adenovirus, also induced Math1 in postmitotic granule
cells in vitro and stimulated the Math1 promoter activity. In contrast, PC3
expression was unaffected in the cerebellar primordium of Math1 null mice,
suggesting that PC3 acts upstream to Math1. As a whole, our data suggest that
cell cycle exit of cerebellar granule cell precursors and the onset of cerebellar
neurogenesis are coordinated by PC3 through transcriptional control of cyclin D1 
and Math1, respectively.

Analysis of cerebellar development in math1 null embryos and chimeras.

Jensen P(1), Smeyne R, Goldowitz D.

Author information: 
(1)University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee 38163, USA.

The cerebellar granule cell is the most numerous neuron in the nervous system and
likely the source of the most common childhood brain tumor, medulloblastoma. The 
earliest known gene to be expressed in the development of these cells is math1.
In the math1 null mouse, neuroblasts never populate the external germinal layer
(EGL) that gives rise to granule cells. In this study, we examined the embryonic 
development of the math1 null cerebellum and analyzed experimental mouse chimeras
made from math1 null embryos. We find that the anterior rhombic lip gives rise to
more than one cell type, indicating that the rhombic lip does not consist of a
homogeneous population of cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that math1 null
granule cells are absent in the math1 null chimeric cerebellum, from the onset of
their genesis in the mouse anterior rhombic lip. This finding indicates a vital
cell intrinsic role for Math1 in the granule cell lineage. In addition, we show
that wild-type cells are unable to compensate for the loss of mutant cells.
Finally, the colonization of the EGL by wild-type cells and the presence of
acellular gaps provides evidence that EGL neuroblasts undergo active migration
and likely have a predetermined spatial address in the rhombic lip.

Distinct domains within Mash1 and Math1 are required for function in neuronal
differentiation versus neuronal cell-type specification.

Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX 75390-9111, USA.

Many members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors
play pivotal roles in the development of a variety of tissues and organisms. We
identify activities for the neural bHLH proteins Mash1 and Math1 in inducing
neuronal differentiation, and in inducing the formation of distinct dorsal
interneuron subtypes in the chick neural tube. Although both factors induce
neuronal differentiation, each factor has a distinct activity in the type of
dorsal interneuron that forms, with overexpression of Math1 increasing dI1
interneurons, and Mash1 increasing dI3 interneurons. Math1 and Mash1 function as 
transcriptional activators for both of these functions. Furthermore, we define
discrete domains within the bHLH motif that are required for these different
activities in neural development. Helix 1 of the Mash1 HLH domain is necessary
for Mash1 to be able to promote neuronal differentiation, and is sufficient to
confer this activity to the non-neural bHLH factor MyoD. In contrast, helix 2 of 
Math1, and both helix 1 and 2 of Mash1, are the domains required for the neuronal
specification activities of these factors. The requirement for distinct domains
within the HLH motif of Mash1 and Math1 for driving neuronal differentiation and 
cell-type specification probably reflects the importance of unique
protein-protein interactions involved in these functions.

Math1 controls cerebellar granule cell differentiation by regulating multiple
components of the Notch signaling pathway.

Cerebellar granule cells (CGC) are the most abundant neurons in the mammalian
brain, and an important tool for unraveling molecular mechanisms underlying
neurogenesis. Math1 is a bHLH transcription activator that is essential for the
genesis of CGC. To delineate the effects of Math1 on CGC differentiation, we
generated and studied primary cultures of CGC progenitors from Math1/lacZ
knockout mice. Rhombic lip precursors appeared properly positioned, expressed
CGC-specific markers, and maintained Math1 promoter activity in vivo and in
vitro, suggesting that Math1 is not essential for the initial stages of
specification or survival of CGC. Moreover, the continuous activity of Math1
promoter in the absence of MATH1, indicated that MATH1 was not necessary for the 
activation of its own expression. After 6, but not 3, days in culture, Math1
promoter activity was downregulated in control cultures, but not in cells from
Math1 null mice, thus implying that Math1 participates in a negative regulatory
feedback loop that is dependent on increased levels of MATH1 generated through
the positive autoregulatory feedback loop. In addition, Math1 null CGC did not
differentiate properly in culture, and were unable to extend processes. All Notch
signaling pathway receptors and ligands tested were expressed in the rhombic lip 
at embryonic date 14, with highest levels of Notch2 and Jag1. However, Math1-null
rhombic lip cells presented conspicuous downregulation of Notch4 and Dll1.
Moreover, of the two transcriptional repressors known to antagonize Math1, Hes5
(but not Hes1) was downregulated in Math1-null rhombic lip tissue and primary
cultures, and was shown to bind MATH1, thus revealing a negative regulatory
feedback loop. Taken together, our data demonstrate that CGC differentiation, but
not specification, depends on Math1, which acts by regulating the level of
multiple components of the Notch signaling pathway.

Isthmus-to-midbrain transformation in the absence of midbrain-hindbrain organizer
activity.

(1)Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics,

In zebrafish acerebellar (ace) embryos, because of a point mutation in fgf8, the 
isthmic constriction containing the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) organizer
fails to form. The mutants lack cerebellar development by morphological criteria,
and they appear to have an enlarged tectum, showing no obvious reduction in the
tissue mass at the dorsal mesencephalic/metencephalic alar plate. To reveal the
molecular identity of the tissues located at equivalent rostrocaudal positions
along the neuraxis as the isthmic and cerebellar primordia in wild-types, we
undertook a detailed analysis of ace embryos. In ace mutants, the appearance of
forebrain and midbrain specific marker genes (otx2, dmbx1, wnt4) in the caudal
tectal enlargement reveals a marked rostralized gene expression profile during
early somitogenesis, followed by the lack of early and late cerebellar-specific
gene expression (zath1/atoh1, gap43, tag1/cntn2, neurod, zebrin II). The Locus
coeruleus (LC) derived from rostral rhombomere 1 is also absent in the mutants. A
new interface between otx2 and epha4a suggests that the rostralization stops at
the caudal part of rhombomere 1. The mesencephalic basal plate is also affected
in the mutant embryos, as indicated by the caudal expansion of the diencephalic
expression domains of epha4a, zash1b/ashb, gap43 and tag1/cntn2, and by the
dramatic reduction of twhh expression. No marked differences are seen in cell
proliferation and apoptotic patterns around the time the rostralization of gene
expression becomes evident in the mutants. Therefore, locally distinct cell
proliferation and cell death is unlikely to be the cause of the fate alteration
of the isthmic and cerebellar primordia in the mutants. Dil cell-lineage labeling
of isthmic primordial cells reveals that cells, at the location equivalent of the
wild-type MHB, give rise to caudal tectum in ace embryos. This suggests that a
caudalto-rostral transformation leads to the tectal expansion in the mutants.
Fgf8-coated beads are able to rescue morphological MHB formation, and elicit the 
normal molecular identity of the isthmic and cerebellar primordium in ace
embryos. Taken together, our analysis reveals that cells of the isthmic and
cerebellar primordia acquire a more rostral, tectal identity in the absence of
the functional MHB organizer signal Fgf8.

Conserved and divergent functions of Drosophila atonal, amphibian, and mammalian

(1)Institute of Molecular Pathology, 1030 Vienna, Austria.

Insect and vertebrate eyes differ in their formation, cellular composition,
neural connectivity, and visual function. Despite this diversity, Drosophila
atona and its vertebrate Ortholog in the eye, Ath5, each regulate determination
of the first retinal neuron class-R8 photo-receptors and retinal ganglion cells
(RGCs)-in their respective organisms. We have performed a cross-species
functional comparison of these genes. In ato mutant Drosophila, ectopic Xenopus
Ath5 (Xath5) rescues photoreceptor cell development comparably with atonaI. In
contrast, mouse Ath5 (Math5) induces formation of very few ommatidia, and most of
these lack R8 cells. In the developing frog eye, ectopic atonal, like Xath5,
promotes the differentiation RGCs. Despite strong conservation of atonaI, Xath5, 
and Math5 structure and shared function, other factors must contribute to the
species specificity of retinal neuron determination. These observations suggest
that the atonaI family may occupy a position in a gene hierarchy where
differences in gene regulation or function can be correlated with evolutionary
diversity of eye development.

In mammals, the permanence of acquired hearing loss is mostly due to the
incapacity of the cochlea to replace lost mechanoreceptor cells, or hair cells.
In contrast, damaged vestibular organs can generate new hair cells, albeit in
limited numbers. Here we show that the adult utricular sensory epithelium
contains cells that display the characteristic features of stem cells. These
inner ear stem cells have the capacity for self-renewal, and form spheres that
express marker genes of the developing inner ear and the nervous system. Inner
ear stem cells are pluripotent and can give rise to a variety of cell types in
vitro and in vivo, including cells representative of ectodermal, endodermal and
mesodermal lineages. Our observation that these stem cells are capable of
differentiating into hair cell-like cells implies a possible use of such cells
for the replacement of lost inner-ear sensory cells.

Math1 is a bHLH transcription factor expressed in neural progenitor cells in
multiple regions of the nervous system. Previously we identified a Math1 enhancer
that directs expression of reporter genes in a Math1 specific pattern
[Development 127 (2000) 1185]. We have used a portion of this enhancer to drive
expression of a nuclear GFP reporter in the Math1 lineage in transgenic mice. In 
this transgenic mouse strain, GFP is expressed in Math1 domains in the (1).
developing spinal cord in progenitors to dI1 dorsal interneurons, (2).
granule-cell progenitors in the developing cerebellum, (3). Merkel cells in the
skin, and (4). hair cells in the developing vestibular and auditory systems.
Furthermore, non-Math1 related expression is detected that is likely due to the
absence of inhibitory regulatory sequences from the transgene. These expression
domains include (1). the apical ectodermal ridge in developing limbs, (2).
post-mitotic cells in the developing cortex and spinal cord, (3). the dentate
gyrus, (4). retina, and (5). olfactory epithelium. Because GFP marks specific
neuronal cell types in living tissue, this transgenic strain is a powerful tool
for future studies on the development and electrophysiological properties of
distinct cell types in the central nervous system and in sensory systems.

Although hair cells regenerate spontaneously in birds and lower vertebrates
following injury, there is yet no effective way to stimulate hair cell
regeneration in mature mammalian inner ears. Here we report that a large number
of hair cells are produced in the sensory epithelium of cultured adult rat
utricular maculae, via adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Hath1, a human
atonal homolog. The generation of new hair cells via Hath1 expression does not
involve cell proliferation based on bromodeoxyuridine immunocytochemistry.
Furthermore, using a similar approach, hair cells are regenerated following
aminoglycoside injury in these cultures. These data show conclusively that mature
mammalian inner ears have the competence to produce a large number of new hair
cells. Local adenoviral gene therapy in the inner ear may be a potential approach
to treatment of hearing and balance disorders.

Sound and movement are perceived through the vibration of modified ciliary
bundles located on the apical surfaces of specialized mechanosensory hair cells. 
These hair cells derive from specific regions of the otocyst that become
determined to develop initially as sensory epithelia and ultimately as either
hair cells or supporting cells. The number of hair cells in an individual
vertebrate is surprisingly small and the ability to replace these cells varies
among different classes. The molecular and cellular factors that specify hair
cell identity are not known, but the results of recent experiments have begun to 
identify some of the signaling pathways that play important roles in hair cell
development. This review will describe recent findings related to the factors
that influence the final choice of a progenitor cell to develop as a hair cell
and discuss their implications for the overall development of the auditory and
vestibular systems.

Math1 gene transfer generates new cochlear hair cells in mature guinea pigs in
vivo.

University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-0648, USA.

Hair cell loss in the mammalian cochlea is irreversible and results in permanent 
hearing loss. Math1, the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor homolog of
the Drosophila atonal gene, is a positive regulator of hair cell differentiation 
during cochlear development. Developing hair cells express Math1, and nonsensory 
cells do not. We set out to determine the outcome of overexpression of Math1 in
nonsensory cells of the cochlea on the phenotype of these cells. We demonstrate
that in vivo inoculation of adenovirus with the Math1 gene insert into the
endolymph of the mature guinea pig cochlea results in Math1 overexpression in
nonsensory cochlear cells, as evident from the presence of Math1 protein in
supporting cells of the organ of Corti and in adjacent nonsensory epithelial
cells. Math1 overexpression leads to the appearance of immature hair cells in the
organ of Corti and new hair cells adjacent to the organ of Corti in the
interdental cell, inner sulcus, and Hensen cell regions. Axons are extended from 
the bundle of auditory nerve toward some of the new hair cells, suggesting that
the new cells attract auditory neurons. We conclude that nonsensory cells in the 
mature cochlea retain the competence to generate new hair cells after
overexpression of Math1 in vivo and that Math1 is necessary and sufficient to
direct hair cell differentiation in these mature nonsensory cells.

A role for BMP heterodimers in roof plate-mediated repulsion of commissural
axons.

Butler SJ(1), Dodd J.

Author information:

Behavior, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.

During spinal cord development, commissural neurons extend their axons ventrally,
away from the roof plate. The roof plate is the source of a diffusible repellent 
that orients commissural axons in vitro and, thus, may regulate the trajectory of
commissural axons in vivo. Of three Bmps expressed in the roof plate, BMP7, but
not BMP6 or GDF7, mimics the roof plate activity in vitro. We show here that
expression of both Bmp7 and Gdf7 by roof plate cells is required for the fidelity
of commissural axon growth in vivo. We also demonstrate that BMP7 and GDF7
heterodimerize in vitro and that, under these conditions, GDF7 enhances the
axon-orienting activity of BMP7. Our findings suggest that a GDF7:BMP7
heterodimer functions as a roof plate-derived repellent that establishes the
initial ventral trajectory of commissural axons.

Zic1 represses Math1 expression via interactions with the Math1 enhancer and
modulation of Math1 autoregulation.

Math1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor expressed in progenitor
cells that give rise to dorsal commissural interneurons in the spinal cord,
granule cells of the cerebellum, and sensory cells in the inner ear and skin.
Transcriptional regulation of this gene is tightly controlled both temporally and
spatially during nervous system development. The signals that mediate this
regulation are likely integrated at the Math1 enhancer, which is highly conserved
among vertebrate species. We have identified the zinc-finger transcription factor
Zic1 as a regulator of Math1 expression. Zic1 binds a novel conserved site within
the Math1 enhancer, and represses both the expression of endogenous Cath1
(chicken homolog of Math1) and the activity of a Math1 enhancer driven lacZ
reporter when expressed in chick neural tubes. Repression by Zic1 blocks the
autoregulatory activity of Math1 itself. Although previous reports have shown
that Zic1 and Math1 are both induced by BMP signaling, these genes appear to have
opposing functions, as Math1 acts to promote neuronal differentiation in the
chick neural tube and excess Zic1 appears to block differentiation. Zic1-mediated
repression of Cath1 transcription may modulate the temporal switch between the
progenitor state and differentiating dorsal cell types during neural tube
development.

Neurotrophins facilitate neuronal differentiation of cultured neural stem cells
via induction of mRNA expression of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors 
Mash1 and Math1.

Ito H(1), Nakajima A, Nomoto H, Furukawa S.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Gifu Pharmaceutical University, Gifu, Japan.

Neurogenesis is promoted by basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors
Mash1, Math1, or NeuroD but suppressed by another set, Hes1 and Hes5. It remains 
unknown what kinds of extracellular signals are involved in their regulation;
therefore, the effects of neurotrophins on the expression of bHLH factors and
neuronal differentiation were investigated by the use of cultured mouse neural
stem cells. Each neurotrophin increased Mash1 and Math1 mRNAs of the stem cells
growing in the presence of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), but did not alter 
Hes1, Hes5, or NeuroD mRNA levels. Simultaneously, most of the cells expressed
nestin but not microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), and remained
undifferentiated. FGF-2 removal from the medium reduced the levels of Hes1 and
Hes5 mRNAs and increased those of Mash1, Math1, and NeuroD mRNAs, resulting in
substantial neuronal differentiation. When the cells were pretreated with
brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a neurotrophin, FGF-2 removal enhanced earlier
NeuroD expression and generated many more MAP2-positive cells. The high level of 
Mash1 and Math1 that had been elevated at FGF-2 withdrawal accelerated NeuroD
expression in cooperation with the reduced Hes1 and Hes5 expression. Our present 
results suggest that neurotrophins stimulate neuronal differentiation by altering
the balance of expression of various bHLH transcription factors.

    Am J Pathol. 2003 Jan;162(1):7-10.

Medulloblastoma is an invasive embryonal tumor of the cerebellum with predominant
neuronal differentiation. Although several genes have been implicated in
medulloblasoma formation, such as Patched (Ptc1) and the adenomatous polyposis
coli gene (Apc), the majority of these tumors cannot be explained by mutations in
these genes. The cellular origin as well as the genetic and molecular changes
involved in the genesis and progression of human medulloblastomas remain largely 
unknown. Here we show that disruption of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1)
causes a high incidence (49%) of aggressive brain tumors in p53 null mice, with
typical features of human cerebellar medulloblastomas. At as early as 8 weeks of 
age, lesions started on the outer surface of the cerebellum from remnant granule 
cell precursors of the developmental external germinal layer. Progression of
these tumors is associated with the re-activation of the neuronal specific
transcription factor Math1, dysregulation of Shh/Ptc1 signaling pathway, and
chromosomal aberrations, including triradial and quadriradial chromosomes. The
present study indicates that the loss of function of DNA double-strand
break-sensing and repair molecules is an etiological factor in the evolution of
the cerebellar medulloblastomas. These PARP-1/p53 double null mice represent a
novel model for the pathogenesis of human medulloblastomas.

The zinc finger transcription factor Gfi1, implicated in lymphomagenesis, is
required for inner ear hair cell differentiation and survival.

Gfi1 was first identified as causing interleukin 2-independent growth in T cells 
and lymphomagenesis in mice. Much work has shown that Gfi1 and Gfi1b, a second
mouse homolog, play pivotal roles in blood cell lineage differentiation. However,
neither Gfi1 nor Gfi1b has been implicated in nervous system development, even
though their invertebrate homologues, senseless in Drosophila and pag-3 in C.
elegans are expressed and required in the nervous system. We show that Gfi1 mRNA 
is expressed in many areas that give rise to neuronal cells during embryonic
development in mouse, and that Gfi1 protein has a more restricted expression
pattern. By E12.5 Gfi1 mRNA is expressed in both the CNS and PNS as well as in
many sensory epithelia including the developing inner ear epithelia. At later
developmental stages, Gfi1 expression in the ear is refined to the hair cells and
neurons throughout the inner ear. Gfi1 protein is expressed in a more restricted 
pattern in specialized sensory cells of the PNS, including the eye, presumptive
Merkel cells, the lung and hair cells of the inner ear. Gfi1 mutant mice display 
behavioral defects that are consistent with inner ear anomalies, as they are
ataxic, circle, display head tilting behavior and do not respond to noise. They
have a unique inner ear phenotype in that the vestibular and cochlear hair cells 
are differentially affected. Although Gfi1-deficient mice initially specify inner
ear hair cells, these hair cells are disorganized in both the vestibule and
cochlea. The outer hair cells of the cochlea are improperly innervated and
express neuronal markers that are not normally expressed in these cells.
Furthermore, Gfi1 mutant mice lose all cochlear hair cells just prior to and soon
after birth through apoptosis. Finally, by five months of age there is also a
dramatic reduction in the number of cochlear neurons. Hence, Gfi1 is expressed in
the developing nervous system, is required for inner ear hair cell
differentiation, and its loss causes programmed cell death.

Nmyc upregulation by sonic hedgehog signaling promotes proliferation in
developing cerebellar granule neuron precursors.

Kenney AM(1), Cole MD, Rowitch DH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard
Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

Hedgehog pathway activation is required for expansion of specific neuronal
precursor populations during development and is etiologic in the human cerebellar
tumor, medulloblastoma. We report that sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling upregulates
expression of the proto-oncogene Nmyc in cultured cerebellar granule neuron
precursors (CGNPs) in the absence of new protein synthesis. The temporal-spatial 
expression pattern of Nmyc, but not other Myc family members, precisely coincides
with regions of hedgehog proliferative activity in the developing cerebellum and 
is observed in medulloblastomas of Patched (Ptch) heterozygous mice.
Overexpression of Nmyc promotes cell-autonomous G(1) cyclin upregulation and CGNP
proliferation independent of Shh signaling. Furthermore, Myc antagonism in vitro 
significantly decreases proliferative effects of Shh in cultured CGNPs. Together,
these findings identify Nmyc as a direct target of the Shh pathway that functions
to regulate cell cycle progression in cerebellar granule neuron precursors.

DNA ligase IV suppresses medulloblastoma formation.

(1)Department of Genetics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis,
Tennessee 38105, USA.

Substantial neural defects are often present in mice with targeted inactivation
of DNA repair factors such as DNA ligase IV (Lig4). Whereas Lig4(-/-) mice
undergo widespread neural apoptosis and die during development, p53 deficiency
rescues this death. We found that all Lig4(-/-)p53(-/-) mice developed
medulloblastoma, but did not develop other tumors of the nervous system.
Lig4(-/-)p53(-/-) medulloblastoma occurred as early as 21 days of age, originated
in the external granule layer of the developing cerebellum, and was synaptophysin
immunoreactive. These data reveal a pronounced susceptibility of the cerebellum
to the effects of chronic DNA damage and provide a direct link between genotoxic 
stress and medulloblastoma formation.

As an approach toward understanding the molecular mechanisms of neuronal
differentiation, we utilized DNA microarrays to elucidate global patterns of gene
expression during pontocerebellar development. Through this analysis, we
identified groups of genes specific to neuronal precursor cells, associated with 
axon outgrowth, and regulated in response to contact with synaptic target cells. 
In the cerebellum, we identified a phase of granule cell differentiation that is 
independent of interactions with other cerebellar cell types. Analysis of pontine
gene expression revealed that distinct programs of gene expression, correlated
with axon outgrowth and synapse formation, can be decoupled and are likely
influenced by different cells in the cerebellar target environment. Our approach 
provides insight into the genetic programs underlying the differentiation of
specific cell types in the pontocerebellar projection system.

Drosophila atonal fully rescues the phenotype of Math1 null mice: new functions

Many genes share sequence similarity between species, but their properties often 
change significantly during evolution. For example, the Drosophila genes
engrailed and orthodenticle and the onychophoran gene Ultrabithorax only
partially substitute for their mouse or Drosophila homologs. We have been
analyzing the relationship between atonal (ato) in the fruit fly and its mouse
homolog, Math1. In flies, ato acts as a proneural gene that governs the
development of chordotonal organs (CHOs), which serve as stretch receptors in the
body wall and joints and as auditory organs in the antennae. In the fly CNS, ato 
is important not for specification but for axonal arborization. Math1, in
contrast, is required for the specification of cells in both the CNS and the PNS.
Furthermore, Math1 serves a role in the development of secretory lineage cells in
the gut, a function that does not parallel any known to be served by ato. We
wondered whether ato and Math1 might be more functionally homologous than they
appear, so we expressed Math1 in ato mutant flies and ato in Math1 null mice. To 
our surprise, the two proteins are functionally interchangeable.

Dissection of the cellular and molecular events that position cerebellar Purkinje
cells: a study of the math1 null-mutant mouse.

Jensen P(1), Zoghbi HY, Goldowitz D.

Author information: 
(1)University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee 38163, USA.

Granule cell precursors in the external germinal layer (EGL) of the cerebellum
have been proposed to be a major player in the migration and positioning of
Purkinje cells through the expression of the Netrin-like receptor Unc5h3 and the 
extracellular matrix molecule Reelin. To explore the role of the EGL on these
processes, we made use of the math1 null-mutant mouse in which the EGL does not
form. In the absence of the EGL, we find three populations of ectopic Purkinje
cells. First, we find 1% of all Purkinje cells in a supracerebellar position at
the dorsal midline. Second, we find 7% of all Purkinje cells in the inferior
colliculus, similar to what is seen in the Unc5h3 mutant. Our finding that Unc5h3
expression is not disrupted in these cells supports the proposed role of EGL
granule cell precursors in establishing the anterior cerebellar boundary through 
the expression of Unc5h3. Third, we find 20% of all Purkinje cells positioned
deep to the cerebellar cortex as seen in the reeler mutant. However, unlike the
reeler mutant, where 5% of the Purkinje cells migrate successfully, we find that 
in the math1 null that 72% of the Purkinje cells migrate successfully. This
finding demonstrates that Purkinje cell migration is not solely dependent on
Reelin signaling from the EGL and is likely caused by Reelin signals emanating
from the nuclear transitory zone or the ventricular zone, or both.

Notch/Notch ligands and Math1 expression patterns in the organ of Corti of

The sensory epithelium of the mammalian cochlea (the organ of Corti) represents
an excellent developmental system. The organ of Corti contains two main cell
types: the sensory hair cells and the supporting cells which are organized in a
defined mosaic pattern. Previous results have demonstrated the participation of
Notch signaling in the regulation of the pattern of hair cell differentiation
within this sensory mosaic. It has also been shown that the basic
helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Math1 is a positive regulator of
hair cell differentiation. We demonstrated that Hes1 and Hes5, two members of the
inhibitory bHLH transcription factors, act as negative regulators of hair cell
differentiation. Loss-of-function studies implicating the neurogenic genes
Notch1, Jag2, Hes1 and Hes5 generated a significant increase in the number of
hair cells. However, their functional interplay within the organ of Corti has not
been determined. To clarify the mechanisms that regulate hair cell
differentiation, we examined the expression of Notch/Notch ligand system and
Math1 in the developing organ of Corti of Hes1- and Hes5-deficient mice. Our
study suggests complex specific relationships between Notch signaling, Math1 and 
Hes1/Hes5 in the control of hair cell differentiation in the developing organ of 
Corti.

atonal is required for exoskeletal joint formation in the Drosophila auditory
system.

Göpfert MC(1), Stocker H, Robert D.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Zoology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.
m.gopfert@bristol.ac.uk

Hearing relies on the delicate arrangement of mechanoreceptor neurones and an
acoustomechanical interface. The concerted action of these neural and non-neural 
components is essential to audition, raising the question of whether they also
develop in a concerted way. Drosophila hears with its antennae. A specialized
antennal joint allows the distal part of the antenna to vibrate in response to
sound and, thus, to serve as the sound receiver. This receiver's vibration is
transduced by a chordotonal sense organ (CHO) that is closely associated with the
joint. Here, we report that atonal (ato), the proneural gene for CHOs, is
required for the formation of this antennal joint. Biophysical measurements in
hemi- and homozygous ato(1) mutant flies show that, in addition to eliminating
the auditory CHO, loss of ato function makes the antennal receiver insensitive to
sound, impairing its auditory function. Anatomically, the cause for this
mechanical effect resides in the deprivation of mobile exoskeletal joint
structures. Hence, ato, the homologue of mouse Math1, is required for the
formation of both the auditory CHO and joint, providing a genetic link between
the very neural and exoskeletal components that together transform fly antennae
into ears.

To facilitate detection of gene activity in tissue sections we combined common
protocols of in situ hybridization on tissue sections (TSISH) with the technique 
of whole-mount in situ hybridization (WMISH). Miniature glass slides for mounting
tissue sections were cut from regular microscope slides and handled for in situ
hybridization in laboratory-made 2-ml containers (baskets) similar to those
originally used for WMISH on Drosophila embryos. A salient point of the method is
the use of airtight reaction vessels placed in a dry thermostat for critical
hybridization steps as this facilitates reproducible and stringent hybridization 
conditions which are difficult to achieve on tissue sections otherwise. The
practicability of the method is illustrated on consecutive serial frozen sections
of murine neonatal cerebellum hybridized for math1 and neuroD, two
developmentally regulated genes with distinct expression patterns. For both genes
excellent spatial resolution and a highly dynamic range of signal intensity was
obtained. The approach enables simple processing of multiple probes, allows the
efficient and economic use of small tissue samples and is amenable to automation.

The mammalian auditory sensory epithelium, the organ of Corti, comprises the hair
cells and supporting cells that are pivotal for hearing function. The origin and 
development of their precursors are poorly understood. Here we show that
loss-of-function mutations in mouse fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (Fgfr1)
cause a dose-dependent disruption of the organ of Corti. Full inactivation of
Fgfr1 in the inner ear epithelium by Foxg1-Cre-mediated deletion leads to an 85% 
reduction in the number of auditory hair cells. The primary cause appears to be
reduced precursor cell proliferation in the early cochlear duct. Thus, during
development, FGFR1 is required for the generation of the precursor pool, which
gives rise to the auditory sensory epithelium. Our data also suggest that FGFR1
might have a distinct later role in intercellular signaling within the
differentiating auditory sensory epithelium.

Retinal development in Drosophila: specifying the first neuron.

Hsiung F(1), Moses K.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cell Biology, Emory University School of Medicine, 615 Michael
Street, NE, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.

In vertebrates, a proneural basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (Ath5,
Atonal homolog 5) plays a crucial role in the specification of the first retinal 
neuron: the retinal ganglion cell (RGC). Math5 homozygous null mutant mice lack
RGCs and have no optic nerve. Furthermore, the expression of the Ath5 protein is 
regulated to give a non-random dispersed pattern of RGCs. In Drosophila, retinal 
histogenesis is precisely coordinated and is associated with a progressive wave
called the morphogenetic furrow. In the furrow, single precisely spaced cells are
specified to become the first retinal neural cell type: the R8 photoreceptor
cell. This Drosophila founder cell specification is coincident with and dependant
upon the expression of the fly Ath5 ortholog: Atonal. Indeed, in both taxa, the
process of founder cell specification may be viewed as the regulation of Atonal
expression. It is now clear that, in flies, this regulation depends on the action
of inductive and inhibitory signals. This review concentrates on the signaling
mechanisms that produce this precise pattern of founder cells.

The role of Math1 in inner ear development: Uncoupling the establishment of the
sensory primordium from hair cell fate determination.

Author information: 
(1)Gonda Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, House Ear Institute, Los
Angeles, CA 90057, USA. pchen@hei.org

During embryonic development of the inner ear, the sensory primordium that gives 
rise to the organ of Corti from within the cochlear epithelium is patterned into 
a stereotyped array of inner and outer sensory hair cells separated from each
other by non-sensory supporting cells. Math1, a close homolog of the Drosophila
proneural gene atonal, has been found to be both necessary and sufficient for the
production of hair cells in the mouse inner ear. Our results indicate that Math1 
is not required to establish the postmitotic sensory primordium from which the
cells of the organ of Corti arise, but instead is limited to a role in the
selection and/or differentiation of sensory hair cells from within the
established primordium. This is based on the observation that Math1 is only
expressed after the appearance of a zone of non-proliferating cells that
delineates the sensory primordium within the cochlear anlage. The expression of
Math1 is limited to a subpopulation of cells within the sensory primordium that
appear to differentiate exclusively into hair cells as the sensory epithelium
matures and elongates through a process that probably involves radial
intercalation of cells. Furthermore, mutation of Math1 does not affect the
establishment of this postmitotic sensory primordium, even though the subsequent 
generation of hair cells is blocked in these mutants. Finally, in Math1 mutant
embryos, a subpopulation of the cells within the sensory epithelium undergo
apoptosis in a temporal gradient similar to the basal-to-apical gradient of hair 
cell differentiation that occurs in the cochlea of wild-type animals.

Distal-less and homothorax regulate multiple targets to pattern the Drosophila
antenna.

Dong PD(1), Dicks JS, Panganiban G.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Anatomy, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, USA.

The Drosophila antenna is a highly derived appendage required for a variety of
sensory functions including olfaction and audition. To investigate how this
complex structure is patterned, we examine the specific functions of genes
required for antenna development. The nuclear factors, Homothorax, Distal-less
and Spineless, are each required for particular aspects of antennal fate.
Coexpression of Homothorax, necessary for nuclear localization of its
ubiquitously expressed partner Extradenticle, with Distal-less is required to
establish antenna fate. Here we test which antenna patterning genes are targets
of Homothorax, Distal-less and/or Spineless. We report that the antennal
expression of dachshund, atonal, spalt, and cut requires Homothorax and/or
Distal-less, but not Spineless. We conclude that Distal-less and Homothorax
specify antenna fates via regulation of multiple genes. We also report for the
first time phenotypic consequences of losing either dachshund or spalt and
spalt-related from the antenna. We find that dachshund and spalt/spalt-related
are essential for proper joint formation between particular antennal segments.
Furthermore, the spalt/spalt-related null antennae are defective in hearing.
Hearing defects are also associated with the human diseases Split Hand/Split Foot
Malformation and Townes-Brocks Syndrome, which are linked to human homologs of
Distal-less and spalt, respectively. We therefore propose that there are
significant genetic similarities between the auditory organs of humans and flies.

Comparison of the generic neuronal differentiation and neuron subtype
specification functions of mammalian achaete-scute and atonal homologs in
cultured neural progenitor cells.

In the vertebrate peripheral nervous system, the proneural genes neurogenin 1 and
neurogenin 2 (Ngn1 and Ngn2), and Mash1 are required for sensory and autonomic
neurogenesis, respectively. In cultures of neural tube-derived, primitive PNS
progenitors NGNs promote expression of sensory markers and MASH1 that of
autonomic markers. These effects do not simply reflect enhanced neuronal
differentiation, suggesting that both bHLH factors also specify neuronal identity
like their Drosophila counterparts. At high concentrations of BMP2 or in neural
crest stem cells (NCSCs), however, NGNs like MASH1 promote only autonomic marker 
expression. These data suggest that that the identity specification function of
NGNs is more sensitive to context than is that of MASH1. In NCSCs, MASH1 is more 
sensitive to Notch-mediated inhibition of neurogenesis and cell cycle arrest,
than are the NGNs. Thus, the two proneural genes differ in other functional
properties besides the neuron subtype identities they can promote. These
properties may explain cellular differences between MASH1- and NGN-dependent
lineages in the timing of neuronal differentiation and cell cycle exit.

Molecular characterization and mapping of ATOH7, a human atonal homolog with a
predicted role in retinal ganglion cell development.

Research, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, Illinois 60614-3394,
USA.

The human ATOH7 gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor
that is highly similar to Drosophila Atonal within the conserved bHLH domain. The
ATOH7 coding region is contained within a single exon. We mapped ATOH7 to
Chromosome (Chr) 10q21.3-22.1, a region syntenic to the segment of mouse Chr 10
where Atoh7 (formerly Math5) is located. The evolutionary relationship between
ATOH7 and other atonal homologs was investigated using parsimony analysis. A
direct comparison of ATH5/7 and ATH1 protein subgroups to Atonal also revealed a 
nonrandom distribution of amino acid changes across the bHLH domain, which may be
related to their separate visual and proprioceptive sensory functions. Among bHLH
genes, ATOH7 is most closely related to Atoh7. This sequence conservation extends
significantly beyond the coding region. We define blocks of strong homology in
flanking human and mouse genomic DNA, which are likely to include cis regulatory 
elements. Because targeted deletion of Atoh7 causes optic nerve agenesis in mice,
we propose ATOH7 as a candidate for human optic nerve aplasia and related
clinical syndromes.

Development of pigment-cup eyes in the polychaete Platynereis dumerilii and
evolutionary conservation of larval eyes in Bilateria.

Author information: 
(1)European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Meyerhofstrasse 1, 69117 Heidelberg,
Germany.

The role of Pax6 in eye development in insects and vertebrates supports the view 
that their eyes evolved from simple pigment-cup ocelli present in their last
common ancestors (Urbilateria). The cerebral eyes in errant polychaetes represent
prototype invertebrate pigment-cup ocelli and thus resemble the presumed
ancestral eyes. We have analysed expression of conserved eye specification genes 
in the early development of larval and adult pigment-cup eyes in Platynereis
dumerilii (Polychaeta, Annelida, Lophotrochozoa). Both larval and adult eyes form
in close vicinity of the optic anlagen on both sides of the developing brain
ganglia. While pax6 is expressed in the larval, but not in the developing, adult 
eyes, expression of six1/2 from trochophora stages onwards specifically outlines 
the optic anlagen and thus covers both the developing larval and adult eyes.
Using Platynereis rhabdomeric opsin as differentiation marker, we show that the
first pair of adult eye photoreceptor cells is detected within bilateral clusters
that transitorily express ath, the Platynereis atonal orthologue, thus resembling
proneural sensory clusters. Our data indicate that--similar to insects, but
different from the vertebrates--polychaete six1/2 expression outlines the entire 
visual system from early developmental stages onwards and ath-positive clusters
generate the first photoreceptor cells to appear. We propose that pax6-, six1/2- 
and ath-positive larval eyes, as found in today's trochophora, were present
already in Urbilateria.

Requirement of Math1 for secretory cell lineage commitment in the mouse

Comment in
    Science. 2001 Dec 7;294(5549):2115-6.

The mouse small intestinal epithelium consists of four principal cell types
deriving from one multipotent stem cell: enterocytes, goblet, enteroendocrine,
and Paneth cells. Previous studies showed that Math1, a basic helix-loop-helix
(bHLH) transcription factor, is expressed in the gut. We find that loss of Math1 
leads to depletion of goblet, enteroendocrine, and Paneth cells without affecting
enterocytes. Colocalization of Math1 with Ki-67 in some proliferating cells
suggests that secretory cells (goblet, enteroendocrine, and Paneth cells) arise
from a common progenitor that expresses Math1, whereas absorptive cells
(enterocytes) arise from a progenitor that is Math1-independent. The continuous
rapid renewal of these cells makes the intestinal epithelium a model system for
the study of stem cell regeneration and lineage commitment.

Expression of Math1 and HES5 in the cochleae of wildtype and Jag2 mutant mice.

The sensory epithelium within the mammalian cochlea (the organ of Corti) is a
strictly ordered cellular array consisting of sensory hair cells and nonsensory
supporting cells. Previous research has demonstrated that Notch-mediated lateral 
inhibition plays a key role in the determination of cell types within this array.
Specificallly, genetic deletion of the Notch ligand, Jagged2, results in a
significant increase in the number of hair cells that develop within the sensory 
epithelium, presumably as a result of a decrease in Notch activation. In
contrast, the downstream mediators and targets of the Notch pathway in the inner 
ear have not been determined but they may include genes encoding the proneural
gene Math1 as well as the HES family of inhibitory bHLH proteins. To determine
the potential roles of these genes in cochlear development, in situ hybridization
for Math1 and HES5 was performed on the cochleae of wild-type vs. Jagged2 mutants
(Jag2deltaDSL). Results in wild-type cochleae show that expression of Math1
transcripts in the duct begins on E13 and ultimately becomes restricted to hair
cells in the sensory epithelium. In contrast, expression of HES5 begins on E15
and becomes restricted to supporting cells in the epithelium. Results in Jag2
mutant cochleae suggest that Math1 transcripts are ultimately maintained in a
larger number of cells as compared with wild-type, while transcripts for HES5 are
dramatically reduced throughout the epithelium. These results are consistent with
the hypothesis that activation of Notch via Jagged2 acts to inhibit expression of
Math1 in cochlear progenitor cells, possibly through the activity of HES5.

Crossinhibitory activities of Ngn1 and Math1 allow specification of distinct
dorsal interneurons.

Distinct classes of neurons are generated from progenitor cells distributed in
characteristic dorsoventral patterns in the developing spinal neural tube. We
define restricted neural progenitor populations by the discrete, nonoverlapping
expression of Ngn1, Math1, and Mash1. Crossinhibition between these bHLH factors 
is demonstrated and provides a mechanism for the generation of discrete bHLH
expression domains. This precise control of bHLH factor expression is essential
for proper neural development since as demonstrated in both loss- and
gain-of-function experiments, expression of Math1 or Ngn1 in dorsal progenitor
cells determines whether LH2A/B- or dorsal Lim1/2-expressing interneurons will
develop. Together, the data suggest that although Math1 and Ngn1 appear to be
redundant with respect to neurogenesis, they have distinct functions in
specifying neuronal subtype in the dorsal neural tube.

Atypical mouse cerebellar development is caused by ectopic expression of the

Zhou H(1), Hughes DE, Major ML, Yoo K, Pesold C, Costa RH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Illinois at Chicago, College
of Medicine, 60607, USA.

To assess the role of hepatocyte nuclear factor-3beta (HNF-3beta) in
hepatocyte-specific gene transcription, we reported the characterization of the
liver phenotype with transgenic mice in which the -3-kb transthyretin (TTR)
promoter functioned to increase HNF-3beta expression. During breeding of the
TTR-HNF-3beta transgenic mice we noticed that they displayed severe ataxia. In
this study, we describe the analysis of our transgenic cerebellar phenotype and
demonstrate that ectopic expression of HNF-3beta disrupted cerebellar
morphogenesis and caused reduction in cerebellar size. In postnatal cerebellum,
the HNF-3beta transgene expression pattern is colocalized to glial fibrillary
acidic protein-positive cerebellar astrocytes and Bergmann glial cells. As a
result of protracted expression, the transgenic cerebella are impaired in terms
of astrocyte dispersal and formation of Bergmann glial cell processes. This
caused a disruption in neuronal cell migration to the cortical laminar layers and
Purkinje dendritic arbor maturation, thus leading to diminished foliation.
Differential hybridization of cDNA arrays was used to identify altered expression
of cerebellar genes, which is consistent with the observed defect in transgenic
cerebellar morphogenesis and size as well as glial maturation. These include
diminished expression of the brain lipid-binding protein, which is required for
glial morphological differentiation, and the basic helix-loop-helix NeuroD/Beta2 
and homeodomain Engrailed-2 transcription factors, which are required for normal 
cerebellar morphogenesis and foliation. Undetectable levels of ataxia
telangiectasia (ATM), which is required for proper development of the Purkinje
dendritic arbor, were found in postnatal transgenic cerebella. Furthermore, the
transgenic cerebella displayed levels of insulin-like growth factor binding
protein-1 elevated to 22 times greater than those measured for wild-type
cerebella, an elevation consistent with the reduction in transgenic cerebellar
size.

The mammalian inner ear contains two sensory organs, the cochlea and vestibule.
Their sensory neuroepithelia are characterized by a mosaic of hair cells and
supporting cells. Cochlear hair cells differentiate in four rows: a single row of
inner hair cells (IHCs) and three rows of outer hair cells (OHCs). Recent studies
have shown that Math1, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila atonal is a positive
regulator of hair cell differentiation. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) genes
Hes1 and Hes5 (mammalian hairy and Enhancer-of-split homologs) can influence cell
fate determination by acting as negative regulators to inhibit the action of
bHLH-positive regulators. We show by using reverse transcription-PCR analysis
that Hes1, Hes5, and Math1 are expressed in the developing mouse cochleae. In
situ hybridization revealed a widespread expression of Hes1 in the greater
epithelial ridge (GER) and in lesser epithelial ridge (LER) regions. Hes5 is
predominantly expressed in the LER, in supporting cells, and in a narrow band of 
cells within the GER. Examination of cochleae from Hes1(-/-) mice showed a
significant increase in the number of IHCs, whereas cochleae from Hes5(-/-) mice 
showed a significant increase in the number of OHCs. In the vestibular system,
targeted deletion of Hes1 and to a lesser extent Hes5 lead to formation of
supernumerary hair cells in the saccule and utricle. The supernumerary hair cells
in the mutant mice showed an upregulation of Math1. These data indicate that Hes1
and Hes5 participate together for the control of inner ear hair cell production, 
likely through the negative regulation of Math1.

The proprioceptive system provides continuous positional information on the limbs
and body to the thalamus, cortex, pontine nucleus, and cerebellum. We showed
previously that the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Math1 is
essential for the development of certain components of the proprioceptive
pathway, including inner-ear hair cells, cerebellar granule neurons, and the
pontine nuclei. Here, we demonstrate that Math1 null embryos lack the D1
interneurons and that these interneurons give rise to a subset of proprioceptor
interneurons and the spinocerebellar and cuneocerebellar tracts. We also identify
three downstream genes of Math1 (Lh2A, Lh2B, and Barhl1) and establish that Math1
governs the development of multiple components of the proprioceptive pathway.

Overexpression of MATH1 disrupts the coordination of neural differentiation in
cerebellum development.

Center, 5323 Harry Hines Boulevard, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA.

An essential role for the bHLH transcription factor MATH1 in the formation of
cerebellar granule cells was previously demonstrated in a Math1 null mouse. The
function of regulated levels of MATH1 in granule cell development is investigated
here using a gain-of-function paradigm. Overexpression of Math1 in its normal
domain in transgenic mice leads to early postnatal lethality and perturbs
cerebellar development. The cerebellum of the (B)MATH1 transgenic neonate is
smaller with less foliation, particularly in the central vermal regions, when
compared to wild-type cerebella. A detailed analysis of multiple molecular
markers in brains overexpressing Math1 has revealed defects in the
differentiation of cerebellar granule cells. NeuroD and doublecortin, markers
normally distinguishing the discrete layered organization of granule cell
maturation in the inner EGL, are aberrantly expressed in the outer EGL where
MATH1-positive, proliferating cells reside. In contrast, TAG-1, a later marker of
developing granule cells that labels parallel fibers, is severely diminished. The
elevated MATH1 levels appear to drive expression of a subset of early
differentiation markers but are insufficient for development of a mature
TAG-1-expressing granule cell. Thus, balanced levels of MATH1 are essential for
the correct coordination of differentiation events in granule cell development.

spalt-dependent switching between two cell fates that are induced by the
Drosophila EGF receptor.

Elstob PR(1), Brodu V, Gould AP.

Author information: 
(1)Medical Research Council, National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, 
London, NW7 1AA, UK.

Signaling from the EGF receptor (EGFR) can trigger the differentiation of a wide 
variety of cell types in many animal species. We have explored the mechanisms
that generate this diversity using the Drosophila peripheral nervous system. In
this context, Spitz (SPI) ligand can induce two alternative cell fates from the
dorsolateral ectoderm: chordotonal sensory organs and non-neural oenocytes. We
show that the overall number of both cell types that are induced is controlled by
the degree of EGFR signaling. In addition, the spalt (sal) gene is identified as 
a critical component of the oenocyte/chordotonal fate switch. Genetic and
expression analyses indicate that the SAL zinc-finger protein promotes oenocyte
formation and supresses chordotonal organ induction by acting both downstream and
in parallel to the EGFR. To explain these findings, we propose a
prime-and-respond model. Here, sal functions prior to signaling as a necessary
but not sufficient component of the oenocyte prepattern that also serves to raise
the apparent threshold for induction by SPI. Subsequently, sal-dependent SAL
upregulation is triggered as part of the oenocyte-specific EGFR response. Thus, a
combination of SAL in the responding nucleus and increased SPI ligand production 
sets the binary cell-fate switch in favour of oenocytes. Together, these studies 
help to explain how one generic signaling pathway can trigger the differentiation
of two distinct cell types.

Requirement for math5 in the development of retinal ganglion cells.

math5 is a murine orthologue of atonal, a bHLH proneural gene essential for the
formation of photoreceptors and chordotonal organs in Drosophila. The expression 
of math5 coincides with the onset of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) differentiation.
Targeted deletion of math5 blocks the initial differentiation of 80% of RGCs and 
results in an increase in differentiated amacrine cells. Furthermore, the absence
of math5 abolishes the retinal expression of brn-3b and the formation of
virtually all brn-3b-expressing RGCs. These results imply that math5 is a
proneural gene essential for RGC differentiation and that math5 acts upstream to 
activate brn-3b-dependent differentiation processes in RGCs.

Hes1 is a negative regulator of inner ear hair cell differentiation.

Zheng JL(1), Shou J, Guillemot F, Kageyama R, Gao WQ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Neuroscience, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080,
USA.

Hair cell fate determination in the inner ear has been shown to be controlled by 
specific genes. Recent loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments have
demonstrated that Math1, a mouse homolog of the Drosophila gene atonal, is
essential for the production of hair cells. To identify genes that may interact
with Math1 and inhibit hair cell differentiation, we have focused on Hes1, a
mammalian hairy and enhancer of split homolog, which is a negative regulator of
neurogenesis. We report here that targeted deletion of Hes1 leads to formation of
supernumerary hair cells in the cochlea and utricle of the inner ear. RT-PCR
analysis shows that Hes1 is expressed in inner ear during hair cell
differentiation and its expression is maintained in adulthood. In situ
hybridization with late embryonic inner ear tissue reveals that Hes1 is expressed
in supporting cells, but not hair cells, of the vestibular sensory epithelium. In
the cochlea, Hes1 is selectively expressed in the greater epithelial ridge and
lesser epithelial ridge regions which are adjacent to inner and outer hair cells.
Co-transfection experiments in postnatal rat explant cultures show that
overexpression of Hes1 prevents hair cell differentiation induced by Math1.
Therefore Hes1 can negatively regulate hair cell differentiation by antagonizing 
Math1. These results suggest that a balance between Math1 and negative regulators
such as Hes1 is crucial for the production of an appropriate number of inner ear 
hair cells.

One of the most striking aspects of all auditory and vestibular sensory epithelia
is the mosaic pattern of hair cells and supporting cells. The factors that are
required for the development of this mosaic have not been determined, however the
results of recent studies have demonstrated that components of the neurogenic
(Notch) signaling pathway are expressed in the developing inner ears of a number 
of different vertebrate species. To examine whether this signaling pathway may
play a similar role in the development of the hair cell mosaic in the mammalian
vestibular system, the expression patterns of proneural (Math1) and neurogenic
(Notch1, Jagged2, HES5) genes were examined in the developing mouse inner ear.
Results indicate that Notch1 is initially expressed throughout the developing
inner ear and becomes restricted to non-sensory cells within the developing
sensory epithelia. In contrast, initial expression of Math1 and Jagged2 is
localized to the developing sensory epithelia and ultimately becomes restricted
to hair cells. Interestingly, transcripts for HES5, a target of Notch activation,
are expressed in the developing cristae but not in the saccule or utricle. These 
results are consistent with the hypothesis that formation of the hair cell mosaic
is regulated through the neurogenic pathway. However the differential expression 
of HES5 within the ear indicates that the downstream targets of Notch1 activation
are not consistent across all of the sensory epithelia and suggests that the
effects of activation of Notch1 in the saccule and utricle must be regulated
through alternate target genes.

For mammalian cochlear hair cells, fate determination is normally completed by
birth. We report here that overexpression of Math1, a mouse homolog of the
Drosophila gene atonal, in postnatal rat cochlear explant cultures resulted in
extra hair cells. Surprisingly, we found that the source of the ectopic hair
cells was columnar epithelial cells located outside the sensory epithelium in the
greater epithelial ridge, which normally give rise to inner sulcus cells.
Moreover, Math1 expression also facilitated conversion of postnatal utricular
supporting cells into hair cells. Thus Math1 was sufficient for the production of
hair cells in the ear, and immature postnatal mammalian inner ears retained the
competence to generate new hair cells.

Autoregulation and multiple enhancers control Math1 expression in the developing

Author information:

Center, Dallas, TX 75235, USA.

Development of the vertebrate nervous system requires the actions of
transcription factors that establish regional domains of gene expression, which
results in the generation of diverse neuronal cell types. MATH1, a transcription 
factor of the bHLH class, is expressed during development of the nervous system
in multiple neuronal domains, including the dorsal neural tube, the EGL of the
cerebellum and the hair cells of the vestibular and auditory systems. MATH1 is
essential for proper development of the granular layer of the cerebellum and the 
hair cells of the cochlear and vestibular systems, as shown in mice carrying a
targeted disruption of Math1. Previously, we showed that 21 kb of sequence
flanking the Math1-coding region is sufficient for Math1 expression in transgenic
mice. Here we identify two discrete sequences within the 21 kb region that are
conserved between mouse and human, and are sufficient for driving a lacZ reporter
gene in these domains of Math1 expression in transgenic mice. The two identified 
enhancers, while dissimilar in sequence, appear to have redundant activities in
the different Math1 expression domains except the spinal neural tube. The
regulatory mechanisms for each of the diverse Math1 expression domains are
tightly linked, as separable regulatory elements for any given domain of Math1
expression were not found, suggesting that a common regulatory mechanism controls
these apparently unrelated domains of expression. In addition, we demonstrate a
role for autoregulation in controlling the activity of the Math1 enhancer,
through an essential E-box consensus binding site.

To determine the extent to which atonal and its mouse homolog Math1 exhibit
functional conservation, we inserted (beta)-galactosidase (lacZ) into the Math1
locus and analyzed its expression, evaluated consequences of loss of Math1
function, and expressed Math1 in atonal mutant flies. lacZ under the control of
Math1 regulatory elements duplicated the previously known expression pattern of
Math1 in the CNS (i.e., the neural tube, dorsal spinal cord, brainstem, and
cerebellar external granule neurons) but also revealed new sites of expression:
PNS mechanoreceptors (inner ear hair cells and Merkel cells) and articular
chondrocytes. Expressing Math1 induced ectopic chordotonal organs (CHOs) in
wild-type flies and partially rescued CHO loss in atonal mutant embryos. These
data demonstrate that both the mouse and fly homologs encode lineage identity
information and, more interestingly, that some of the cells dependent on this
information serve similar mechanoreceptor functions.

Genesis of cerebellar granule cells is controlled by key transcription factors,
such as the lineage-specific basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factor
MATH-1, whose activity is dependent upon dimerization with bHLH E-proteins. In an
effort to understand the molecular mechanisms of bHLH proteins orchestrating
cerebellar development, we explored the spatio-temporal expression of the ME1
E-protein. Our results reveal that ME1 expression is first detected in the
cerebellar primordium and then in the rhombic lip cells at E12.5. Its expression 
persists in the emerging external germinal layer during embryonic expansion. In
adult cerebellum, prominent ME1 expression is detected in mature granule cells
located in the internal granular layer. However, ME1 expression is not sustained 
in aged cerebellum. A similar declined pattern of expression is also observed in 
the aging hippocampus.

The basic helix-loop-helix gene Math1, a positive regulator of neuronal
differentiation, is specifically expressed in the dorsal part of the developing
nervous system. To determine the effects of ectopic expression of Math1, we
generated two transgenic mouse lines; One carried the Cre recombinase gene under 
the control of the nestin promoter and enhancer, which direct expression in
neural precursor cells, and the other carried the Math1 gene, the expression of
which was regulated by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter but interrupted by the 
stop cassette flanked by loxP sites. In F1 embryos that carried the two
transgenes, the stop cassette was removed by Cre recombinase in the developing
nervous system, and Math1 expression was ectopically directed from the CMV
promoter. We found that these embryos exhibited abnormal morphology of the brain 
and extensive cell death in the nervous system. These results suggest that
ectopic expression of Math1 is toxic to neurons and leads to apoptosis.

The mammalian inner ear contains the cochlea and vestibular organs, which are
responsible for hearing and balance, respectively. The epithelia of these sensory
organs contain hair cells that function as mechanoreceptors to transduce sound
and head motion. The molecular mechanisms underlying hair cell development and
differentiation are poorly understood. Math1, a mouse homolog of the Drosophila
proneural gene atonal, is expressed in inner ear sensory epithelia. Embryonic
Math1-null mice failed to generate cochlear and vestibular hair cells. This gene 
is thus required for the genesis of hair cells.

Inductive factors are known to direct the regional differentiation of the
vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) but their role in the specification of
individual neuronal cell types is less clear. We have examined the function of
GDF7, a BMP family member expressed selectively by roof plate cells, in the
generation of neuronal cell types in the dorsal spinal cord. We find that GDF7
can promote the differentiation in vitro of two dorsal sensory interneuron
classes, D1A and D1B neurons. In Gdf7-null mutant embryos, the generation of D1A 
neurons is eliminated but D1B neurons and other identified dorsal interneurons
are unaffected. These findings show that GDF7 is an inductive signal from the
roof plate required for the specification of neuronal identity in the dorsal
spinal cord and that GDF7 and other BMP family members expressed by the roof
plate have non-redundant functions in vivo. More generally, these results suggest
that BMP signaling may have a prominent role in the assignment of neuronal
identity within the mammalian CNS.

Expression of nine neurogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors
was examined in an immortalized neuronal progenitor cell line HC2S2, which
differentiates into neurons after suppression of the v-myc expression with
tetracycline. Expression of MASH-1, NeuroD, NeuroD-related factor (NDRF) and
HES-1 was demonstrated in HC2S2 cells by Northern blot analysis using total RNA. 
Expression of MASH-1 mRNA was downregulated upon differentiation of HC2S2 cells
into mature neurons. In contrast, NeuroD and NDRF mRNA expression was maintained 
all through the differentiation. The expression of HES-1, a negative regulator of
the neuronal differentiation, was upregulated temporarily in accordance with the 
suppression of the v-myc expression and was downregulated upon the
differentiation of HC2S2 cells into neurons. The reduced expression of HES-1 mRNA
in undifferentiated HC2S2 cells may be explained by the transcriptional
suppression of HES-1 by the myc oncoprotein. The above data imply that both HES-1
and MASH-1 need to be downregulated at the time of accomplishment of the terminal
differentiation into mature neurons and that NeuroD and NDRF participate in the
regulatory process of the terminal differentiation in combination.

Center, Dallas, TX 75235, USA.

MATH1 is a neural-specific basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. Members
of this family of transcription factors are involved in the development of
specific subsets of neurons in the developing vertebrate nervous system. Here we 
examine the cells expressing MATH1 with respect to their proliferative state and 
co-expression of cell-type-specific differentiation markers. We localize the
MATH1 protein to the nucleus of cells in the dorsal neural tube and the external 
germinal layer (EGL) of the developing cerebellum. Using double-label
immunofluorescence, we demonstrate that MATH1-expressing cells span both the
proliferating and the differentiating zones within the dorsal neural tube, but
within the EGL of the cerebellum are restricted to the proliferating zone. The
early differentiating MATH1-expressing cells in the dorsal neural tube co-express
TAG-1, DCC-1 and LH2, markers of dorsal commissural interneurons. In addition,
transgenic mice with lacZ under the transcriptional control of MATH1-flanking DNA
sequences express beta-galactosidase specifically in the developing nervous
system, in a manner that mimics subsets of the MATH1-expression pattern,
including the dorsal spinal neural tube. Expression of the MATH1/lacZ transgene
persists in differentiated dorsal commissural interneurons. Taken together, we
demonstrate MATH1 expression in a differentiating population of neuronal
precursors in the dorsal neural tube that appear to give rise specifically to
dorsal commissural interneurons.

ath3, a vertebrate basic helix-loop-helix gene homologous to Drosophila proneural
gene atonal, can directly convert non-neural cells into neurons with the anterior
features. In the mouse, ath3 expression initially occurs widely in the developing
nervous system and then gradually becomes restricted to the neural retina. Here, 
we characterized the genomic organization and promoter activity of mouse ath3
(Math3). Math3 gene consists of two exons separated by an 8-kilobase intron, and 
the whole protein-coding region is located in the second exon. Transcription
starts at two sites, which are 75 nucleotides apart from each other, and there is
no typical TATA box in the upstream region of either start site. Transient
transfection analysis showed that the 5'-region of Math3 can direct efficient
expression in neuroblastoma cells but not in glioma or fibroblast cells. Deletion
studies revealed that the proximal 193-base pair region, which contains the
downstream transcription initiation site but not the upstream site, is essential 
for the Math3 promoter activity and can direct efficient expression in
neuroblastoma cells. In contrast, retrovirus-mediated promoter analysis
demonstrated that a region further upstream is additionally necessary for retinal
expression. These results indicate that Math3 promoter contains two essential
regulatory regions, the proximal 193-base pair region, which confers efficient
neural-specific expression, and a region further upstream, required for retinal
expression.

The cerebellum is essential for fine motor control of movement and posture, and
its dysfunction disrupts balance and impairs control of speech, limb and eye
movements. The developing cerebellum consists mainly of three types of neuronal
cells: granule cells in the external germinal layer, Purkinje cells, and neurons 
of the deep nuclei. The molecular mechanisms that underlie the specific
determination and the differentiation of each of these neuronal subtypes are
unknown. Math1, the mouse homologue of the Drosophila gene atonal, encodes a
basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is specifically expressed in the
precursors of the external germinal layer and their derivatives. Here we report
that mice lacking Math1 fail to form granule cells and are born with a cerebellum
that is devoid of an external germinal layer. To our knowledge, Math1 is the
first gene to be shown to be required in vivo for the genesis of granule cells,
and hence the predominant neuronal population in the cerebellum.

Gene expression of MASH-1, MATH-1, neuroD and NSCL-2, basic helix-loop-helix
proteins, during neural differentiation in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells.

We examined the gene expression of MASH-1, MATH-1, neuroD and NSCL-2 during
neural differentiation of P19 embryonal carcinoma cells using reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction and high performance liquid
chromatography. These proteins are members of basic helix-loop-helix
transcription factor family and their expressions are reported to be transient
and restricted in the nervous system during early neurogenesis. Retinoic acid
(RA-, 1 microM)-treatment and aggregation for 4 days induced and greatly
increased MASH-1, neuroD and NSCL-2 mRNA in P19 cells. The increases peaked at
day 3, 4 and 5, respectively. RA-treatment increased MATH-1 mRNA slightly. mRNA
of MAP2, a neural differentiation marker, were increased by RA-treatment and the 
increases reached to the plateau at day 5. The results indicate that the gene
expression of MASH-1, MATH-1, neuroD and NSCL-2 during neural differentiation in 
P19 cells is transient and the order is similar to that in the mouse embryo
nervous system as previously reported.

XATH-1, a vertebrate homolog of Drosophila atonal, induces a neuronal
differentiation within ectodermal progenitors.

York, New York 10021, USA.

XATH-1, a basic/helix-loop-helix transcription factor and a homolog of Drosophila
atonal and mammalian MATH-1, is expressed specifically in the dorsal hindbrain
during Xenopus neural development. In order to investigate the role of XATH-1 in 
the neuronal differentiation process, we have examined the effects of XATH-1
overexpression during Xenopus development. XATH-1 induces the expression of
neuronal differentiation markers, such as N-tubulin, within the neural plate as
well as within nonneural ectodermal progenitor populations, resulting in the
appearance of process-bearing neurons within the epidermis. The related
basic/helix-loop-helix genes neurogenin-related-1 and neuroD are not induced in
response to XATH-1 overexpression within the embryo, suggesting that XATH-1 may
activate an alternate pathway of neuronal differentiation. In further contrast to
neurogenin-related-1 and neuroD, high-level expression of general neural markers 
expressed earlier in development, such as N-CAM, is not induced by XATH-1
overexpression. Competent ectodermal progenitors therefore respond to ectopic
XATH-1 expression by initiating a distinct program of neuronal differentiation.

The lineage of olfactory neurons has been relatively well characterized at the
cellular level, but the genes that regulate the proliferation and differentiation
of their progenitors are currently unknown. In this study, we report the
isolation of a novel murine gene, Math4C/neurogenin1, which is distantly related 
to the Drosophila proneural gene atonal. We show that Math4C/neurogenin1 and the 
basic helix-loop-helix gene Mash1 are expressed in the olfactory epithelium by
different dividing progenitor populations, while another basic helix-loop-helix
gene, NeuroD, is expressed at the onset of neuronal differentiation. These
expression patterns suggest that each gene marks a distinct stage of olfactory
neuron progenitor development, in the following sequence:
Mash1>Math4C/neurogenin1>NeuroD. We have previously reported that inactivation of
Mash1 function leads to a severe reduction in the number of olfactory neurons. We
show here that most cells in the olfactory epithelium of Mash1 mutant embryos
fail to express Math4C/neurogenin1 or NeuroD. Strikingly, a subset of progenitor 
cells in a ventrocaudal domain of Mash1 mutant olfactory epithelium still express
Math4C/neurogenin1 and NeuroD and differentiate into neurons. Cells in this
domain also express Math4A/neurogenin2, another member of the Math4/neurogenin
gene family, and not Mash1. Our results demonstrate that Mash1 is required at an 
early stage in the olfactory neuron lineage to initiate a differentiation program
involving Math4C/neurogenin1 and NeuroD. Another gene activates a similar program
in a separate population of olfactory neuron progenitors.

Conversion of ectoderm into a neural fate by ATH-3, a vertebrate basic

We have isolated a novel basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) gene homologous to the
Drosophila proneural gene atonal, termed ATH-3, from Xenopus and mouse. ATH-3 is 
expressed in the developing nervous system, with high levels of expression in the
brain, retina and cranial ganglions. Injection of ATH-3 RNA into Xenopus embryos 
dramatically expands the neural tube and induces ectopic neural tissues in the
epidermis but inhibits non-neural development. This ATH-3-induced neural
hyperplasia does not require cell division, indicating that surrounding cells
which are normally non-neural types adopt a neural fate. In a Xenopus animal cap 
assay, ATH-3 is able to convert ectodermal cells into neurons expressing anterior
markers without inducing mesoderm. Interestingly, a single amino acid change from
Ser to Asp in the basic region, which mimics phosphorylation of Ser, severely
impairs the anterior marker-inducing ability without affecting general neurogenic
activities. These results provide evidence that ATH-3 can directly convert
non-neural or undetermined cells into a neural fate, and suggest that the Ser
residue in the basic region may be critical for the regulation of ATH-3 activity 
by phosphorylation.

Restricted expression of a novel murine atonal-related bHLH protein in

Tissue-specific bHLH proteins play important roles in the specification and
differentiation of neural cell lineages in invertebrate and vertebrate organisms.
Two groups of bHLH proteins, atonal and achaete-scute, have proneural activities 
in Drosophila, and the mouse achaete-scute homolog MASH1 is required for the
differentiation of several neural lineages. In a screen for proteins interacting 
with MASH1, we have isolated a novel bHLH protein related to atonal, named
MATH4A, which is broadly expressed in neural precursor cells in the mouse
embryonic CNS and PNS. Interaction assays in yeast and in vitro demonstrate that 
MATH4A interacts efficiently with both MASH1 and the ubiquitous bHLH protein E12.
MATH4A-E12 heterodimers, but not MATH4A-MASH1, bind to a consensus E-box
sequence. Math4A expression is restricted to undifferentiated neural precursors
and is complementary to that of Mash1 in most regions of the nervous system. In
particular, Math4A is transcribed at high levels in the cerebral cortex, dorsal
thalamus, and epibranchial placodes, which present little or no Mash1 expression.
However, expression of the two genes shows limited overlap in certain CNS regions
(retina, preoptic area of the hypothalamus, midbrain, hindbrain). Its structure
and expression pattern suggest that MATH4A may regulate an early step of neural
development, either as a partner of ubiquitous bHLH proteins or associated with
other neural-specific bHLH proteins.

atonal.

It has been shown that mammalian neurogenesis is partly controlled by multiple
basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) genes, as in Drosophila. Recently, mouse homologs
of Drosophila atonal, a proneural gene encoding a bHLH protein required for
chordotonal organ and photoreceptor development, have been characterized to
obtain further insights into the molecular nature of mammalian neurogenesis.
Here, to assess their potential involvement in genetic neural disorders, we have 
determined genetic map positions for four mouse atonal-related genes, Atoh1,
Atoh2, Atoh3, and Ndrf, which encode MATH-1, MATH-2, MATH-3, and NDRF,
respectively. Interspecific backcross analysis indicated that Atoh1 and Atoh2
were located in separate positions of Chr 6 and that Atoh3 and Ndrf were mapped
to Chr 10 and Chr 11, respectively. Thus, these structurally related genes are
located separately on multiple chromosomes.

A mammalian helix-loop-helix factor structurally related to the product of
Drosophila proneural gene atonal is a positive transcriptional regulator
expressed in the developing nervous system.

We report the molecular characterization of a mouse basic helix-loop-helix
factor, designated MATH-1, structurally related to the product of the Drosophila 
proneural gene atonal. MATH-1 mRNA is first detected in the cranial ganglions and
the dorsal part of the central nervous system on embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5). From
E10.5 onward, prominent expression of MATH-1 continues in the dorsal part of the 
central nervous system but becomes restricted to the external granular layer of
the cerebellum by E18 and is undetectable in the adult nervous system. MATH-1
activates E box-dependent transcription in collaboration with E47, but the
activity is completely antagonized by the negative regulator of neurogenesis
HES-1. These results suggest that MATH-1 may be a target of HES-1 and play a role
in the differentiation of subsets of neural cells by activating E box-dependent
transcription.

MATH-2, a mammalian helix-loop-helix factor structurally related to the product
of Drosophila proneural gene atonal, is specifically expressed in the nervous
system.

In Drosophila, multiple helix-loop-helix (HLH) factors play an essential role in 
neural development. Mammalian homologues of such Drosophila HLH factors have been
recently characterized and provide useful information for the analysis of the
mechanisms of mammalian neurogenesis. We report here the molecular
characterization of a novel mouse HLH factor, designated MATH-2, that has a
structural homology to the product of Drosophila proneural gene atonal. MATH-2
consists of 337 amino acid residues and contains an atonal-related basic HLH
domain. However, outside of this domain, there is no significant sequence
similarity between MATH-2 and Atonal. MATH-2 expression occurs by embryonic day
11.5 (E11.5), and is first detected in the wall of brain vesicles as well as in
the spinal cord. It is expressed in the cortical plate and the mantle layer
throughout the developing central nervous system but not in the ventricular zone.
By E13.5, the expression becomes more prominent in the cortical plate of the
cerebrum but decreases in the other regions. In the adult, the cerebrum produces 
a high level of MATH-2 RNA but other neural tissues produce only low levels.
MATH-2 RNA is not detected in non-neural tissues, indicating that MATH-2
expression is specific to the nervous system. The gel mobility-shift analysis
shows that MATH-2 can interact with several E-box sequences in collaboration with
E47, a ubiquitously expressed HLH factor. These results raise the possibility
that MATH-2 may be a trans-acting factor involved in the development and
maintenance of the mammalian nervous system.
